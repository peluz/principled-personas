"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips is in House 1 (directly left of House 2, where the flutist lives).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies is in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist is in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

Now, we have the following arrangement:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The only instrument left is percussion, which must be in House 1, since all other instruments are accounted for.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips, Percussionist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement, Pianist

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses. Let's use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 5 and Clue 8:** Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis

4. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 7:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
6. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.

Given that the percussionist cannot be in the second house, and considering Clue 4, the cellist must be in the third house, and the person with the gameboy must be in the second house.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy
- House 3: Percussionist

7. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
8. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
9. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.

Since the root beer lover must be in the third house (House 3), the person who only drinks water and the person who has a television must be in the first and second houses. Given that the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who has a television must be in the first house.

- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Television
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

Thus, the cellist lives in House 3.

\(\boxed{C}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the positions.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."

From Clue "
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.

3. **Combining Clues 2 and 4**: Since the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges, and they are next to each other, the only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Swimmer
   - House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Person eating oranges

4. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Given the arrangement from Clue 4, the soccer player must be in house 1.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

6. **Assigning Sports and Fruits**:
   - House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
   - House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
   - House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first or second house. But since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second or third house. Given that the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the percussionist must be in the third house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. But the second house has the bouquet of daffodils, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.

Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the violinist is in the first house, the person who has a radio and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the second house.
- **Clue 8:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the second house, the history book buff must be in the third house.

Summarizing the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house:

1. **First House:** Violinist, ate spaghetti, mystery book reader, has a radio.
2. **Second House:** Daffodils, ate pizza, has a vase of tulips, has a phone.
3. **Third House:** Percussionist, ate fried rice, science fiction book fanatic, has a television, history book buff.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's start by summarizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The bird keeper does not live in the first house.**
2. **The mystery book reader lives in the second house.**
3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
5. **The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
6. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
7. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
8. **The cellist does not live in the third house.**

Let's place the known information first:

- **House 2**: Mystery book reader
- **House 1**: History book buff (since the history book buff lives directly left of the bouquet of lilies, which must be in House 2)
- **House 2**: Bouquet of lilies
- **House 1**: Computer (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person with a computer, and the percussionist must be in House 1)
- **House 2**: Bird keeper (since the bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3)
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast (since the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1)

Now, we need to place the remaining items:

- **House 1**: Gameboy (since the gameboy lives directly left of the person with a rose bouquet, and the rose bouquet must be in House 2)
- **House 2**: Rose bouquet
- **House 3**: Phone (since the only device left is the phone)
- **House 3**: Romance book lover (since the only book left is the romance book)
- **House 3**: Carnations arrangement (since the only flower left is the carnations)
- **House 3**: Cellist (since the cellist cannot be in House 3, and the only remaining role is the cellist)

The final arrangement is:

- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

From this arrangement, we can see that the person who has a gameboy lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is: **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start by placing the horse owner in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 5).

- House 3: Horses

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the dog owner and the person with the bouquet of lilies.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the radio and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 3 or 4: Radio and Carnations arrangement (they must be next to each other)

Since the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast (Clue 1), and the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other, the radio must be in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 10 to place the banana and carnations arrangement.

- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 2 or 3: Banana (one house between them)

Since the banana is to the left of the carnations arrangement, the banana must be in House 2.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the apple and cat lover.

- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies
- House 1: Apple (one house between them)

Since the apple is to the left of the cat lover, the cat lover must be in House 4.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we use Clue 12 to place the orange and apple.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Since there is one house between the apple and orange, the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Finally, we use Clue 13 to place the banana and cat lover.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Since there are two houses between the banana and cat lover, the banana must be in House 1 and the cat lover in House 4.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Now, we need to place the fruits and pets.

- House 1: Banana
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 1, the carnations arrangement is to the right of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

- House 1: Fish
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 5, the horse owner is in House 3.

- House 1: Fish
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 7, the apple is to the left of the cat lover, so the apple must be in House 1.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 12, the orange is to the left of the apple, so the orange must be in House 3.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 13, the banana is to the left of the cat lover, so the banana must be in House 2.

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Phone and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the solution as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, and the history book buff lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 2.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can infer:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and is a history book buff, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct house number for each person based on their book preference and sport. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Starting with the given information:

1. **Golfer - House 1**

Using Clue 3:
- The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
- This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible).
- Therefore, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
  - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Using Clue 1:
- The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible).
- Therefore, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
  - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Using Clue 4:
- The swimmer does not live in the third house.
- Therefore, the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Using Clue 2:
- The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
- Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house (Clue 3).
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second or fourth house (Clues 1 and 4).
3. The history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers (Clue 2).
4. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover (Clue 5).

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader is in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a gameboy, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means if the white person lives in house 1, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 2, the coffee drinker must live in house 4. If the white person lives in house 3, the coffee drinker must live in house 1. If the white person lives in house 4, the coffee drinker must live in house 2.

2. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in house 1, and the person who likes green must live in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

3. **The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the history book buff can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

4. **The romance book lover does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the romance book lover can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **The root beer lover lives in the third house.**
   - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

6. **The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.**
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in houses 1, 2, or 3.

7. **The person who likes red lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 3, which is the root beer lover.

8. **The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.**
   - This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

9. **The tea drinker does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the tea drinker can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green, and from clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we deduce:
- The person in house 1 likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a radio.

Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (Clue 3) and the person in house 2 has a radio, the person in house 1 cannot be the fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 4, the person in house 2 had pizza. Since the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast, the person in house 1 must have had spaghetti.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Spaghetti
- House 2: Yellow, Fish enthusiast, Pizza, Radio

The cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's deduce the solution step-by-step:

1. **Clue 5**: The flutist lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the cellist must be in the second and third houses, respectively.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses, respectively.
6. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 11**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 12**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent with the previous deduction.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent with the previous deduction.
12. **Clue 9**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a 5-house grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

Let's start by placing the clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples.
- From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis.
- From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

- House 1: Boots (since the person wearing boots cannot be in House 2)

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses. Since House 1 has a phone, the person with a radio must be in House 2, and the person with horses must be in House 1.

Thus, the distribution is:
- House 1: Boots, Horses, Radio
- House 2: High heels, Phone

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in House 2.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Starting with the baseball player in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Given that the basketball player is to the left of the swimmer, the swimmer must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Thus, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house (Clue 11).
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast (Clue 3), so the fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
3. The person who had pizza and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other (Clue 1), and the person who had pizza does not live in the third house (Clue 4). Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in the second or fourth house. Since the second house is occupied by the fish enthusiast, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.
4. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 5). Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, the person who has a computer must live in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice must live in the fifth house.
5. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy (Clue 6). Since the person who has a computer lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house. The first house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, and the second house is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who owns horses must live in the first house.
6. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 8), and there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives (Clue 7). Since the bird keeper cannot live in the first or second house, and the person who has a television cannot live in the first or second house either, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 9) and somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 10). Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house and the person who ate fried rice lives in the fifth house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person who owns horses
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Person who had stew
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who ate fried rice

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the correct answer as follows:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person in house 2 drives a minivan and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person in house 4 is wearing sandals and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other, so the person in house 2 is wearing boots.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From the above deductions, we can confirm that the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their characteristics.

Given clues:
1. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The cricketer lives in the first house.
3. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's start by placing the cricketer in House 1 as per Clue 2.

1. **House 1:** Cricketer
2. **House 2:** ?
3. **House 3:** ?

From Clue 4, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.

1. **House 1:** Cricketer
2. **House 2:** Horses
3. **House 3:** Sedan

From Clue 3, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.

1. **House 1:** Cricketer
2. **House 2:** Horses
3. **House 3:** Sedan and Cat lover

From Clue 1, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 1, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2.

1. **House 1:** Basketball player
2. **House 2:** Truck
3. **House 3:** Sedan and Cat lover

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 8**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 11**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
8. **Clue 12**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible.
9. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
10. **Clue 14**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 15**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
12. **Clue 16**: The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 17**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
14. **Clue 18**: The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
15. **Clue 19**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

Let's start by placing the radio in the fourth house (Clue 4).

Next, we need to place the vase of tulips and the bouquet of daffodils. Since the vase of tulips is to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, and the bouquet of daffodils is not in the third house, the possible positions for the bouquet of daffodils are 1 or 2. If it were in the first house, the vase of tulips would be in the second, third, or fourth house. If it were in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. 

Let's assume the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house. Then the vase of tulips would be in the third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips cannot be in the fourth house. So, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fifth house.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the rose bouquet would be in the first house (Clue 8). The bouquet of lilies would be in the first or second house, but since the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies would be in the first house (Clue 9).

The television cannot be in the second house (Clue 10), so it must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television cannot be in the fourth house. If the television is in the first house, the person with the television would be in the first house, the radio in the fourth house, the bouquet of daffodils in the second house, the vase of tulips in the third or fifth house, and the rose bouquet in the first house. This leaves the gameboy in the third house, which is consistent with Clue 9.

The fish enthusiast must be in the first house (Clue 11), and the SUV must be in the second house (Clue 14). The bird keeper must be in the third house (Clue 12). The guitarist must be in the second house (Clue 13), and the horses must be in the fifth house. The percussionist must be in the fourth house (Clue 15), and the cat lover must be in the fifth house (Clue 18).

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

The answer is \boxed{C}."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct placements.

We have four houses, numbered 1 to 4, and each house has a person with specific characteristics:
- Shoes: high heels, boots, loafers, running shoes
- Car: sedan, convertible, truck, SUV
- Lunch: stew, spaghetti, fried rice, grilled cheese
- Drink: coffee, water, milk, root beer

Given clues:
1. The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start placing the known information:
- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:
- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the first house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the information:
1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the first house person is wearing loafers, the second house person must be wearing sandals (as loafers and sandals are the only two options left for the second house).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4**: The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 6**: The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3 to place the person who only drinks water. Since they do not live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, let's use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The correct answer is:

(C) 3"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of characteristics for each house. Let's start by organizing the given information and using logical deductions.

- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2 or 5.
- If the person who ate spaghetti is in House 5, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who had stew does not live in the third house:
- Stew must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner:
- If the cat lover is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 2.
- If the cat lover is in House 2, the dog owner must be in House 3.
- If the cat lover is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.
- If the cat lover is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover:
- If the cat lover is in House 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 3, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the cat lover is in House 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 5.

From Clue 15, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio:
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 1, the person with a radio must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 2, the person with a radio must be in House 3, 4, or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the person with a radio must be in House 4 or 5.
- If the fish enthusiast is in House 4, the person with a radio must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television:
- If the person who owns horses is in House 1, the person with a television must be in House 2.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 2, the person with a television must be in House 3.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 3, the person with a television must be in House 4.
- If the person who owns horses is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.

By analyzing all the clues and using logical deductions, we can determine that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
From clue 2, the television is in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only valid pair is (1, 3) or (2, 4). Given that House 3 is taken, the pair must be (1, 3).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, we know the soccer player is in House 5. Since the soccer player is in House 5, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in House 4 (clue 2), which is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the soccer player is in House 5, the grilled cheese must be in House 4, but House 4 is taken by the golfer. Therefore, the soccer player must be in House 5, and the grilled cheese must be in House 4.

Now, let's re-evaluate the positions:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, and since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only possible pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3. This means:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of characteristics for each house.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

Given Clue 1, the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: The person who likes white, drinks water, and is a swimmer.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti, drinks milk, and is a baseball player.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, fruits, and drinks.

### Clues:
1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means:
   - If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house.
   - If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.

3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

### Combining the Clues:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's deduce the solution step-by-step:

1. **House 1**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. **House 2**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **House 3**: The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in the third house.
4. **House 3 (continued)**: Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
5. **House 1 (continued)**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

Let's start placing the clues:

- **House 3: Dog owner**
- **House 5: Root beer lover**

From clue 10, the bird keeper must be in House 4, and the person with loafers must be in House 5. This conflicts with the root beer lover in House 5, so the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the person with loafers must be in House 4.

- **House 3: Bird keeper**
- **House 4: Person with loafers**

From clue 9, the person with carnations must be in House 3, which conflicts with the bird keeper in House 3. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the person with loafers must be in House 4.

"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house, so the tennis player must live in the second house.

Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the second house must be occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast (as everyone likes a different kind of book).

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 13**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Loafers

2. **Clue 12**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in House 4, and the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 4 is already occupied by loafers, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - House 3: Bouquet of lilies
   - House 2: Guitarist

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

   - House 1: Pizza
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils

6. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Since House 1 and House 2 are already occupied, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 or 3.
   - House 1: Pizza
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Stew
   - House 4: Spaghetti

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Stew
   - House 4: Spaghetti
   - The person who likes white must be in House 3 or 4.
   - Since House 3 is occupied by stew, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

8. **Clue 9**: There are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.
   - The person who likes green must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - The pianist must be in House 3, 4, or 5 (but House 5 is not possible as there are only 4 houses).
   - The only possible positions are:
     - House 1: Green
     - House 3: Pianist

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
   - This confirms the previous clue.

    - House 2: Violinist
    - The person who likes green must be in House 1.

16. **Clue 16**: The person who is a saxophonist likes yellow.
    - House 1: Green
    - The person who likes yellow must be in House 2.

17. **Clue 17**: The person who is a guitarist likes white.
    - House 4: Spaghetti
    - The person who likes white must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 10:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the cellist in House 1 and then use the other clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, we use Clue 5 and Clue 8 to place the basketball player and the person wearing running shoes:
- The basketball player must be to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities for the basketball player and the running shoes:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- If the basketball player is in House 4, the person wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

Let's assume the basketball player is in House 3 and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, we use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 4, the cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).
- If the flutist is in House 3, the cricketer must be in House 2 (but House 2 is running shoes, so this is not possible).

Since none of these placements work, let's try the basketball player in House 4 and the person wearing running shoes in House 3:

- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, we use Clue 7 and Clue 10 to place the flutist and the cricketer:
- The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 4, the flutist cannot be in House 4. Let's consider the possibilities for the flutist and the cricketer:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the cricketer must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1.

Let's assume the flutist is in House 2 and the cricketer is in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in House 3 and the cricketer in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, we use Clue 9 to place the person who likes yellow and milk:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, we use Clue 12 to place the person who only drinks water and the coffee drinker:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Based on the given clues and the constraints of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer (Clue 2).
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives (Clue 4).
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples (Clue 5).
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer (Clue 6).
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house (Clue 7).

From Clue 1 and Clue 7, we know that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Using Clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white must be in the second and third houses, respectively.

From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer must be in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house.

From Clue 5, the soccer player lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must also be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

From Clue 13, the person wearing running shoes is in House 1. From Clue 17, the person wearing boots is in House 3. From Clue 7, the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 18, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the swimmer is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper does not live in the fourth house, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in the first house, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is consistent.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner does not live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 13**: The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Pizza

2. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish

3. **Clue 3**: The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not fried rice

4. **Clue 12**: The swimmer lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Swimmer

5. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
   - Since House 5 has pizza, House 4 must have grilled cheese.
   - House 4: Grilled cheese

6. **Clue 2**: The cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - Since the fish enthusiast is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Cat lover

7. **Clue 12**: The swimmer lives in the second house.
   - This is already placed, so no change.

8. **Clue 5**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
   - The cricketer must be in House 1 or 2, and the tennis player must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

9. **Clue 4**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - The basketball player must be in House 4 or 5, and the tennis player must be in House 3 or 2.

10. **Clue 7**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
    - The cricketer must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

11. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
    - The person eating oranges must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating mangos must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

12. **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

14. **Clue 11**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating apples must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 5: Pizza, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Given the constraints, the only remaining options for House 1 are:
- House 1: Fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the solution step-by-step:

1. From Clue 1: The person eating grapes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person in the second house must be eating grapes.
2. From Clue 2: The baseball player lives in the second house. Hence, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.
3. From Clue 3: The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. Thus, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Cricketer, drives a minivan.
- House 2: Baseball player, drives a convertible, and eats grapes.

Since the person in the first house is the cricketer and eats mangos (as the person in the second house eats grapes), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

Summarizing the information:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since House 2 is already occupied by the mystery book reader, the root beer lover must be in House 2, and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, their occupants, and their pets and cars. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

From Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to place the people in the houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The root beer lover lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- The person who likes yellow (in the third house) lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

From clue 1:
- The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, the blue person must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4:
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must live in the first house. Therefore, the white person must live in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

- **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. This means the dog owner cannot be in house 3 (since there is no house to the right of house 3). So, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2.

Let's start placing the information:

- Since the person who likes blue is in house 2 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3 (Clue 7).
- The person who is eating grapes cannot be in house 3 (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating oranges cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 1, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 2.
- The basketball player cannot be in house 3 (Clue 3), so they must be in house 1. This means the person who is eating oranges is the basketball player.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so they must be in house 3.
- The dog owner cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so they must be in house 1.
- The person who likes green cannot be in house 1 (Clue 4), so they must be in house 3. This means the cat lover likes green.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.**

   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice, tea drinker, and possibly the flutist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

Given that the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house (Clue 7), we can start by placing this information.

Next, let's use Clue 10: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

Using Clue 13: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the romance book lover and the mystery book reader must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes blue lives in house 5.
- The romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.
- The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.

- The person who likes green must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

After careful analysis, we can determine that the history book buff lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
\boxed{A}"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the solution as follows:

   - This implies the cellist is in house 1 and the person with the gameboy is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct house numbers for each person based on their car and device.

1. **The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Minivan

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Television

4. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - The phone is in House 1, so the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or House 5.
   - House 4 or House 5: Bouquet of lilies

5. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - The radio cannot be in House 4 or 5 (since the bouquet of daffodils must be in one of these houses), so the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since House 1 is occupied by the phone and House 3 is occupied by the television, the radio must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Radio

6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - Therefore, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5.
   - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The only remaining positions are House 4 and House 5.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 5.

The correct answer is: **(E) 5**."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 3:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. **Clue 6:** The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

Let's start placing the known information:

- **House 1:** Bird keeper (Clue 6)
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer, Fish enthusiast, and Person wearing running shoes
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct placements.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 1)
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow
- Red
- Green

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the correct answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the golfer must have lilies and the basketball player must have eaten grilled cheese.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the basketball player in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (the soccer player).

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the person with tulips is in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the basketball player in house 2 must have the tulips.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips and ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils and ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3**: The pianist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can immediately place the following:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

4. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (redundant with Clue 4).

Since the pianist lives in the third house and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house, we can conclude that the person who likes green does not live in the third house.

6. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 6**: The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist must live in the first or second house.

8. **Clue 4**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Clue 8**: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
10. **Clue 10**: The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

Let's start placing the remaining characteristics:
- Since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the pianist is in the third house, the percussionist and cellist must be in the first and second houses.

Let's assume:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist

This satisfies Clue 10. Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics (stew, yellow, white, and the remaining instrument and food):
- Clue 4: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 8: There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

Let's place stew and yellow:
- If the person who had stew lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow must live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the pianist.
- If the person who had stew lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow must live in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: The remaining person, the remaining food, and the remaining color.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 5, and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

- House 5: Green

Now, we need to place the remaining food and instrument:
- The person who had stew lives in House 2, so the remaining food is pizza.
- The person who likes white must live in House 5, so the remaining instrument is the cello.

- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

### Arranging the Remaining Information:

- The person who ate stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti

"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. Each person ate something different for lunch: one had pizza and one ate fried rice.
3. Everyone likes a different kind of book: one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we can logically conclude:
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the information step-by-step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is a pianist.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the person who owns horses cannot live in house 2, as the root beer lover would then have to live in house 1, which is not possible since the pianist lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

From the above points, we can deduce:
- House 1: Pianist, likes white, owns horses.
- House 2: Root beer lover, does not like white.

Since the root beer lover lives in house 2 and the person who owns horses lives in house 1, the person in house 2 cannot be the horse owner. Therefore, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by summarizing the clues and deducing the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
2. **The person who had stew lives in the second house.**
3. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**

5. **There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.**
6. **The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.**

We can start by placing the known information:

- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

Next, using clue 5:
- The person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Fried Rice
  - House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

Using clue 3:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. The possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Using clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. The percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using clue 1:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using clue 4:
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house. The possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Combining all the clues, we can deduce the following:
- The percussionist must be in house 2 (since it is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic and to the left of the history book buff).
- The science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 (since the percussionist is in house 2 and the history book buff is to the right of the percussionist).
- The history book buff must be in house 3 (since the percussionist is in house 2 and the violinist is to the right of the percussionist).

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils

From clue 5, since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and we know the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From clue 6, since the dog owner lives to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3.

From clue 7, since the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who owns horses is in House 1.

From clue 8, since the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

From Clue 1, since the person who only drinks water lives in the first house, the person who likes milk must live in the third house (because there is one house between them).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in the first house (since the person with lilies is in the second house and must be to the right of the person with tulips).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only drink left is water, and the only flower left is a rose bouquet. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's analyze and place the information step by step.

1. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4**: The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clues 2, 4, and 6, we can conclude that the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. **Clue 9**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
   - Since the flutist is in the third house, the gameboy must be in the fourth house.

5. **Clue 14**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
   - This aligns with the previous clue, confirming the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who has a radio does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 13**: The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 15**: The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - Since the running shoes are in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 7**: The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - The science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

10. **Clue 11**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Clue 10**: There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
12. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
13. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
14. **Clue 3**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
15. **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the third house is occupied by the person with a phone, the flutist, and the person wearing running shoes, the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between the person who is wearing high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the first house is occupied by the romance book lover, the second house by the science fiction book fanatic, and the third and fourth houses by the person with a phone and the percussionist, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, the person who has a radio does not live in the second house, so the person who has a radio must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

From Clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the second house, which is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.

From Clue 14, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live next to each other. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be the flutist.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house, which is occupied by the percussionist.

From Clue 11, the history book buff lives to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the first house, which is occupied by the romance book lover.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to determine the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct relationships:

- **Clue 2 and Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in consecutive houses.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses.

From Clue 2 and Clue 6, we can deduce that the pizza eater and the yellow lover are in consecutive houses, and the tea drinker is in the next house to the right of the yellow lover. This gives us a sequence: pizza, yellow, tea.

From Clue 7, we know the orange eater and the apple eater are in consecutive houses. Since the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater, the sequence must be: pizza, orange, apple.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct placements.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist is in the third house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.
5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. The percussionist is in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, which satisfies this clue.
6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. Therefore, the history book buff is in the first house, and the guitarist is in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

Summarizing the arrangement:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Television

2. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Loafers

3. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4.

4. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.**
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. **There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.**
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pairs are (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots, Radio
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, let's summarize the current assignments:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The remaining devices are the phone and the gameboy. From clue 3, the person with the phone cannot be in House 2, so the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. Since House 1 is already assigned to Boots and House 3 is assigned to Sandals, the phone must be in House 4.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4."

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in the third house is wearing running shoes.

Since the second and third houses are occupied by high heels and running shoes, the first house must be occupied by loafers.

From clue 3 and clue 4, we know:
- The milk drinker does not live in the first house.
- The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.

Therefore, the first house must be the water drinker.

This leaves:
- The second house (high heels) cannot be the coffee drinker.
- The third house (running shoes) must be the coffee drinker.

Thus, the second house must be the water drinker.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the solution as follows:

1. From Clue 1: The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.
2. From Clue 2: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.
3. By elimination, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics and items in the correct houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

Let's start by organizing the clues and making deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other.
- From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals.
- From Clue 3, the person with running shoes is not in the third house.
- From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person with pizza.
- From Clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the person with sandals.
- From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person with stew.
- From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio.
- From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person with pizza.
- From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. **House 1:** Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
2. **House 2:** Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
3. **House 3:** Vase of tulips, Radio
4. **House 4:** Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the constraints of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This implies the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the saxophonist cannot live in house 1, and the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is eating mangos.

From the above deductions, we can fill in the details for each house:

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- **House 2:** Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the five houses. Let's use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 14**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their flowers, and their cars.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step and deduce the correct arrangement.

1. **Clue 2**: The person with a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 4**: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 12**: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.

11. **Clue 11**: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover:

- Since the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk are next to each other, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover are next to each other, we can place them in the remaining houses.

Using Clue 13 and Clue 7, we place the history book buff and the percussionist:

- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.

Using Clue 6, we place the person with a carnations arrangement and the pianist:

- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

Using Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the violinist cannot be in the fourth house and must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Using Clue 8, we place the person who only drinks water:

- Violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

Using Clue 10 and Clue 11, we place the science fiction book fanatic and the person with a bouquet of lilies:

- Science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
- Person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

Using Clue 9, we know the romance book lover does not live in the third house. Using Clue 5, we place the coffee drinker and the mystery book reader:

- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Finally, using Clue 14, we place the cellist and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:

- Cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Science fiction book fanatic, Daffodils, Root beer lover
3. House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, Bouquet of lilies, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Bouquet of lilies, Daffodils, Milk drinker
5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the solution step by step.

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, their favorite books, lunch, and favorite colors.

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - From clue 1, the person who likes green is in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3 (where the fantasy book enthusiast would be to the right), so the person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Let's summarize the deductions:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses based on the provided clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **House 1:** Carnations arrangement
2. **House 3:** Yellow (from Clue 4)

Given these initial placements, we can use the other clues to deduce the remaining information:

- **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other. Since House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, House 3 has yellow.
- **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since House 3 has yellow, the horses and blue must be in House 2 or House 1.
- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, so it must be in House 2.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives. This means the percussionist and the truck cannot be in House 1 and 3, so they must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.
- **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and 2 or House 2 and 3.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Tulips (since it's next to the bird keeper and not yellow or rose)
- House 3: Yellow

Given that the bird keeper and the vase of tulips are next to each other, and the rose bouquet is in House 2, the bird keeper must be in House 2.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From these clues:
- The person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist, and likes green.
- The person in the second house must like red and be a mystery book reader (since the only remaining book type is mystery).

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

14. **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
15. **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
   - Therefore, the golfer is in house 2.

2. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the history book buff is in house 1.

3. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - This means if the swimmer lives in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3, and vice versa. If the swimmer lives in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

Since the history book buff is in house 1, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either house 2 or house 3. Given that the golfer is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2. Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 3.

This leaves the swimmer to be in house 1 (since there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic).

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover

- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- Since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1, and the history book buff must be in house 2.

- From Clue 1, if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses. Since the history book buff is in house 2, the person in house 2 cannot own horses. Therefore, the person in house 1 must own horses, and the person in house 2 must be wearing sandals.

- Now, we know:
  - House 1: Wears sandals, owns horses, ate spaghetti, is a history book buff.
  - House 2: Wears running shoes, owns a cat, ate fried rice, is a romance book lover.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This implies that the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the person in house 1 is not the flutist, the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can conclude:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (and the flutist)

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a grid of four houses. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
4. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the swimmer lives.
5. **Clue 2:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
6. **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
7. **Clue 7:** The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 5:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- **Clue 3:** The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
- **Clue 6:** The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Using **Clue 8**:
- There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Next, using **Clue 4**:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 2**:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 7**:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person with carnations, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 5**:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the tennis player, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using **Clue 9**:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Golfer

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 4**: The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 8**: The flutist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Flutist

   - This is the same as Clue 8, confirming the relationship.

10. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
    - This means the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue are three houses apart.

11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
    - This means the person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of House 3.

    - This means the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover are two houses apart.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
    - This means the person who likes milk is in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

14. **Clue 14**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
    - This means the person who likes red is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's start placing the characteristics based on the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to deduce the correct house and food/colored combination for each person. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in House 4, the person who likes red must live in House 2.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the clues, let's deduce the positions:

- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and the person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, the only consistent placement for the person who likes green is House 5. This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively.

Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (E) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to place the individuals into the houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, the third house is ruled out for the basketball player and the tennis player.

From clue 5, the percussionist lives in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the basketball player must live to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the third house.

Let's verify this with the other clues:
- Clue 1: The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in the third house, the violinist must be in the first or second house. But the percussionist is in the second house, so the violinist must be in the first house.
- Clue 4: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

   - Therefore, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 5.

8. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
   - Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 4 or 5. But the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5, and the cellist is in house 5, so the percussionist must be in house 4.

9. **Clue 16:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), the tea drinker is in house 1 and the pianist is in house 5.

10. **Clue 10:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).

11. **Clue 11:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
    - Since the phone is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker).

12. **Clue 6:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
    - Since the percussionist is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker).

13. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
    - The cellist is in house 5 and the guitarist is in house 3, which is consistent.

14. **Clue 9:** The cellist does not live in the fourth house.
    - This is consistent with the placement.

15. **Clue 2:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
    - Since the cellist is in house 5, the vase of tulips must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is the phone, house 2 is the root beer lover, and house 3 is the coffee drinker, so the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

16. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
    - The phone is in house 1 and the television is in house 5.

From the above deductions, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in House 5.

From Clue 17, there is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

By analyzing the clues and the possible positions, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the truck must be in House 3, and the convertible must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given the contradictions in Clues 5 and 6, we need to re-evaluate the clues. Let's assume the saxophonist and the basketball player are in different houses:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house), and must be a fish enthusiast.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 2:** History book buff (Clue 3)
- **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- **House 1:** Pizza (Clue 10)
- **House 3:** Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff

Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- **House 3:** Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, the people, and their respective musical instruments and fruits.

### Clues Recap:
1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. This means they are in adjacent houses.
2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.
3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.
4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is \(\boxed{A}\)."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house because they cannot live in the first house.

From clue 2, the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the person in the second house must be eating oranges.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."

   - House 2: Daffodils
   - House 3: Running Shoes

8. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Vase of Tulips

From the above steps, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3:

- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.

9. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.

From Clue 10 and Clue 4, we can deduce:
- The swimmer, the person who likes white, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left, the person who likes white in the middle, and the person who only drinks water on the right.

From Clue 9, we know:
- The tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who only drinks water is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes white.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

From Clue 8, we know:
- The person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the person who is eating oranges.

2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red (since white and green are already taken)
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White (since red and green are already taken)

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Let's start with Clue 5:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's consider the possibilities:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house (contradicting the given information that the rose bouquet is in the second house).
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
- Since the romance book lover and the vase of tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the vase of tulips.
- Since the carnations arrangement is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

   - The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

2. **Shoe Preferences:**
   - One person is wearing loafers, and the other is wearing sandals.

3. **Book Preferences:**
   - One person is a science fiction book fanatic, and the other is a romance book lover.

From clue 2, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house. Therefore, House 1 is the science fiction book fanatic's house.

Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the coffee drinker must be in House 1. This means the person in House 2 is the one wearing sandals.

Now, we can assign the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Sandals, romance book lover

Thus, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we can logically conclude:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 because house 1 is to the left of house 2.
- Therefore, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist lives in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, their favorite colors, and the types of cars they own.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's start by placing the convertible in the second house:
- House 2: Convertible

Next, we need to place the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes white, ensuring there is one house between them:
- If the person who owns a sedan is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3, but this would violate the ""one house between"" rule.

Thus, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes white
- House 2: Convertible
- House 3: Person who owns a sedan

Now, we need to place the person who likes yellow. According to the third clue, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan:
- House 1: Yellow

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Convertible
- House 3: White

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3 and 4:
- The person who ate fried rice (and is the fantasy book enthusiast) lives in the second house.

Using clue 2:
- The science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house because the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house.

From clue 1:
- The person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house since the person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) is in the second house.

Thus, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 2, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the left of the dog owner.
2. The houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right).

Since the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. From clue 3, the person in house 2 is eating kiwis.
2. From clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be drinking water and the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.
3. From clue 2, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals.
4. The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis). Therefore, the person in house 2 must be drinking milk.
5. The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Thus, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person who is eating grapes and the person who is wearing sandals are next to each other. Given that there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in the left house (House 1) if the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in the left house (House 1) if the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

Thus, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

Since the person in House 1 is wearing high heels and the person in House 2 is wearing sandals, and the person in House 1 is a tea drinker, the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (as per Clue 2).

Therefore, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis (since the only fruit left is kiwis).

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to place the people in the houses based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot live in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - So, the violinist must live in house 1 or 2.

Given these clues, let's place the information:

- House 1: Tea drinker (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the possible placements for the violinist and the guitarist:

- If the violinist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This means the cellist must be in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics accordingly.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4:
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5:
- There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker and the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This implies the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the soccer player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5 and Clue 8), so the soccer player must be in the first or second house. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must be in the first or second house as well.

From Clue 4 and Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second or fourth house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the convertible cannot be there (Clue 6).

From Clue 7, the person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the baseball player cannot be in the third house (Clue 5), so the baseball player must be in the first or second house. The person who owns a sedan must be to the right of the baseball player, so the person who owns a sedan must be in the third or fourth house.

Given the constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the third house. The correct answer is (A)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.**
2. **The percussionist does not live in the second house.**
3. **The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.**
4. **The history book buff does not live in the second house.**
5. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.**
6. **The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.**
7. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.**
8. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
9. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.**
10. **The cat lover lives in the first house.**

Given that the cat lover lives in the first house, we can start by placing the cat lover in House 1.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Using the clues, we can deduce the following:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1.
- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).
- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).
- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).
- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).
- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3, as the only remaining book type is science fiction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and apply each clue to determine the correct arrangement of houses, fruits, and favorite colors. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Grapes

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

5. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

From Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Grapes

From Clue 2 and Clue 5, we can infer:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. Since House 2 is occupied by grapes, the only possible arrangement is houses 1 and 3.

From Clue 4:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.

From Clue 1:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 1.

From Clue 3:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in House 1 and the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who is eating a banana must be in House 4.

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: White, Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in house 1 and the cat lover in house 2.
- From Clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their preferences.

1. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses.

2. **The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.**
   - So, the second house has the water drinker.

3. **The root beer lover lives in the first house.**
   - So, the first house has the root beer drinker.

4. **The person who has a television does not live in the second house.**
   - So, the television is in either the first or third house.

5. **The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips cannot be in the third house, and the television must be in the third house.

From clue 4 and 5, we can deduce:
- The television is in the third house.
- The vase of tulips must be in the first or second house.

Since the root beer drinker is in the first house (clue 3), the vase of tulips cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses. Given that the first house has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given the clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.
- From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try the percussionist in House 3 and the white person in House 4:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Let's try the percussionist in House 4 and the white person in House 5:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

Finally, let's try the percussionist in House 5 and the white person in House 1:
- House 1: White
- House 5: Percussionist

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since the percussionist is in House 5, the guitarist must be in House 4, and the yellow person in House 3.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 2.

- House 2: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 2, the television must be in House 1, but House 1 is already occupied by the white person. Therefore, the percussionist cannot be in House 5.

After all the trials, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the saxophonist lives is \boxed{C}."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses. Let's break down the clues and use logical reasoning to find the solution.

### Clues:
1. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the two people who like root beer and the one who likes guitar must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses, pets, and flowers. Let's break it down step by step.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2: The dog owner does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - This means the dog owner cannot live in house 3 (because there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must live in house 1.
   - Consequently, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 1: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.**
   - Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

### Combining the Clues:
- The dog owner is in house 1.
- The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

Given these constraints:
- If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
- If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 3, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.
   - If the person who is wearing boots lives in House 4, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 1, 3, or 4: Wearing loafers

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1 or 2: Phone
   - House 2 or 3: Sandals

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1 or 2: Eating oranges
   - House 2 or 3: Computer

9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 1, 2, or 4: Bouquet of lilies

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
    - House 1 or 4: Wearing loafers

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - House 1: Rose bouquet
    - House 2: Eating banana

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 1, the person with high heels must be in House 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3. Therefore, the person with high heels cannot be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person with a banana is in House 2. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, fruits, and pets in each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangoes

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information and use the clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Mangoes
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house (clue 4).
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff (clue 3), so the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house (clue 1), so the romance book lover must be in the first house.

Since the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the only remaining house for the romance book lover is the second house.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 2).
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first or third house (Clues 3 and 4).
4. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker (Clue 5).
5. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house (Clue 6).

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker is in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house. This is consistent with Clues 3 and 4, as the person eating mangos cannot be in the first or third house.

From Clue 5, the person eating apples (in the first house) must be to the left of the tea drinker. Therefore, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in the third house, so the person eating kiwis must be in the first house. This conflicts with the person eating apples being in the first house. Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in the fourth house, and the person eating mangos must be in the first house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, which means there is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the clues.

Given clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, which aligns with clue 7.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, which is already confirmed.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is \(\boxed{D}\)."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses. Let's use the provided clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Using Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Using Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Using Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Using Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Using Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Using Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Using Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5:

- If the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2, and the minivan must be in house 3 (since the minivan is to the right of the truck).
- If the truck is in house 2, the gameboy must be in house 3, and the minivan must be in house 3 (but this would violate Clue 6, as the flutist cannot be in house 0).

So, the truck must be in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the minivan in house 3.

Now, the minivan and cellist are adjacent (Clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 2.

The flutist is directly left of the minivan (Clue 6), so the flutist must be in house 1.

The high heels and television are adjacent (Clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (Clue 7). Since the flutist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 3 (the only remaining house).

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the house number where the person eating apples lives by analyzing the provided clues. Let's break down the clues step-by-step:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television.
6. The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
8. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
9. The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
10. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist.
11. The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
12. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
13. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 5, we know the person with the bouquet of daffodils is in house 2, and the person with the television is in house 3. From clue 8 and 10, the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 4, and the person with the piano is in house 5. From clue 9 and 11, the violinist and the person eating oranges are in houses 3 and 4, respectively, because they are next to each other and the person eating oranges is to the left of the saxophonist. Therefore, the person eating apples must be in house 4.

Thus, the correct answer is:

(A) 4"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to use the given clues to deduce the arrangement of the houses, the flowers, the drinks, and the types of cars. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 has lilies.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker lives in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must live in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 (leftmost house) and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2 (middle house).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Now, we know:
- House 1: SUV, Root Beer Lover
- House 2: Lilies, Rose Bouquet, Tea Drinker
- House 3: Coffee Drinker

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house, the SUV owner must be the basketball player.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew eater must live in one of the first three houses.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. This means the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the stew and pizza eaters must be in houses 1-2 or 2-3.
6. **Clue 11**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the grilled cheese eater must live in one of the first three houses.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the green lover must live in one of the first two or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the basketball player, the green lover must live in one of the first two houses.
8. **Clue 13**: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house. This is a direct statement, so the white lover is the basketball player.
9. **Clue 14**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. This means the saxophonist cannot live in the first house.
10. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the red lover and the sedan owner must be in consecutive houses.
11. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. This means the convertible owner must live in one of the second, third, or fourth houses.
12. **Clue 10**: The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. This means the cellist and the flutist must be in consecutive houses.

Now, let's start placing the information:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: (Not the soccer player, not the basketball player, not the SUV owner, not the flutist, not the cellist, so it must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.)
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Since the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the red lover cannot be in house 4, the red lover must be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be in house 2.

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: Red lover, owns a sedan, ate grilled cheese (since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 4 and the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

The answer is: \boxed{D}"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the three houses based on the provided clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

Given the above, let's place the characteristics in the houses:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2, but house 2 is already taken by red. Therefore, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by grapes. Thus, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues into a structured grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - Bird keeper: House 2

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - Lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - Pizza must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - Tulips and dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - Spaghetti must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - Grilled cheese must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - Horse owner: House 4

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - Grilled cheese: House 1

Given these clues, we can start placing the information:

- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Since the bird keeper is in house 2 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart, and the violinist cannot be in house 1 or 4, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1 or 4. Given that house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater and house 4 by the horse owner, the rose bouquet person must be in house 4.

This leaves the violinist in house 3.

Next, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist cannot be in house 4, the guitarist must be in house 1 or 2. Given that house 1 is occupied by the grilled cheese eater and house 2 by the bird keeper, the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Finally, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in house 1 or 4, the dog owner must be in house 3, and the tulips in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's systematically deduce the solution:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics into the four houses. Let's use the clues to deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 6**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's organize the information and use the given clues step-by-step:

1. **Clue 1**: The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. **Clue 2**: The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can deduce that the second house is occupied by both the basketball player and the violinist, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to interpret the clues differently. Let's assume the clues are referring to different people.

Given:
- The basketball player lives in the second house.
- The violinist lives in the second house.

Since the basketball player and the violinist cannot both live in the second house, we need to consider the possibility that the clues are referring to different aspects of the people's characteristics. Let's place the basketball player and the violinist in the second house and deduce the positions of the cricketer, cellist, and soccer player.

From Clue 1, the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, so the cricketer must be in the first house. Consequently, the cellist must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Basketball player (and Violinist)
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player and violinist are in the second house, the soccer player must be in the first house.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

Thus, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.

9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can immediately place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist is in house 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1, as they are next to each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given information into a grid. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E) 5"
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The romance book lover is in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The soccer player is in house 2 (Clue 4).

Since the romance book lover is in house 2 and the soccer player is in house 2, the person in house 1 cannot be the romance book lover or the soccer player. 

From Clue 1, if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1. This means the person in house 1 is not the root beer lover.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1.

Therefore, the root beer lover is in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic (sport, favorite color, and flowers) in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

From Clue 2, the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player. Since the soccer player cannot live in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1, 2, and 3 are already occupied, so the soccer player must live in House 5, and the cricketer must live in House 1.

- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Soccer, Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1:** The violinist lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 is the violinist.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the computer must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- House 1: Violinist and has a computer.
- House 2: Bird keeper (since the violinist is in house 1 and the bird keeper cannot be in house 1).

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics (shoes, cars, and pets) in the correct houses.

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only remaining characteristic for House 3 is the running shoes. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic grid puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the nature of the logic grid puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1:
- The history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4:
- The mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3:
- The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:

To determine if the 1936 Summer Olympics venue is too small for a Super Bowl crowd, we need to compare the seating capacity of the Olympiastadion Berlin with the typical crowd size for a Super Bowl.

The Olympiastadion Berlin had a capacity of approximately 100,000 spectators. In contrast, the Super Bowl typically attracts a much larger audience, with stadiums holding between 60,000 to 80,000 people. However, the total crowd size for the Super Bowl, including stadium capacity and additional viewing areas, often exceeds 100,000 people.

Given these figures, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would be too small to accommodate the typical Super Bowl crowd. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes."

Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, we can reason as follows:

1. **Understanding the Context**: The question involves a gardener with entomophobia (fear of insects) growing seedless cucumbers.
2. **Key Factors**:
   - Seedless cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which can involve managing the presence of insects.
   - Entomophobia can make interactions with insects highly stressful or impossible for the gardener.

3. **Logical Deduction**:
   - Growing seedless cucumbers typically requires controlling pollination, which may involve managing insects.
   - A gardener with entomophobia would likely find such management challenging or distressing.

Therefore, based on the constraints and the expertise in logic grid puzzles, the correct answer is (B) No."
"Given the context of the question and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, we can approach this problem by considering the number of theses Martin Luther wrote and the time frame provided.

Martin Luther is known to have written 95 theses in total. If he were to write one thesis per day, we need to determine if he would run out of theses in half a year.

Half a year is approximately 182.5 days. Since Martin Luther only wrote 95 theses, he would run out of theses well before half a year.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No

Given the context of a logic grid puzzle, we can analyze the question by considering the nature of waltz and slam dance. Waltz is a structured dance with defined steps and movements, while slam dance involves more vigorous and less controlled actions. While waltz can still pose risks, especially if performed incorrectly or by inexperienced dancers, slam dance generally carries a higher risk of injury due to its more dynamic and unpredictable nature. Therefore, based on the structured and controlled movements of waltz compared to the more vigorous and less controlled movements of slam dance, waltz is not less injurious than slam dance."

In the context of logic grid puzzles, if we consider the relationship between euphoria and drug addiction, we can map this to a grid where one axis represents the substance and the other axis represents the effect. For instance, if we have a grid where the rows represent different drugs and the columns represent their effects, we can place ""euphoria"" in the column for positive effects. Many drugs, such as opioids and stimulants, would be associated with this column, indicating that they induce euphoria. This association is a key factor in the initial use and potential addiction to these substances."

Given the context of a logic grid puzzle, we need to consider the abilities and attributes of Apollo and D'Artagnan in a structured and logical manner. Apollo, as a god in Greek mythology, possesses a wide array of supernatural abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and the ability to manipulate natural elements. On the other hand, D'Artagnan is a skilled human swordsman from the novel ""The Three Musketeers,"" known for his bravery and swordsmanship.

To determine if all of the famous Apollo's could hypothetically defeat all of the famous D'Artagnan's, we need to analyze their respective strengths and limitations:

1. **Apollo's Strengths:**
   - Superhuman physical abilities.
   - Divine powers, such as manipulating natural elements.
   - Immortality and near-invincibility.

2. **D'Artagnan's Strengths:**
   - Skilled swordsmanship.
   - Bravery and courage.
   - Strategic thinking and quick reflexes.

While Apollo's divine powers would give him a significant advantage in a physical confrontation, the number of D'Artagnan figures could potentially outnumber Apollo's divine interventions. However, even with multiple D'Artagnan figures, the sheer power and invincibility of Apollo would likely give him an overall advantage.

Therefore, based on the logical analysis and the constraints of the scenario, it is more likely that a single Apollo would defeat a single D'Artagnan, and multiple Apollos would defeat multiple D'Artagnans. Thus, the answer is (A) No."

Given the constraints of a logic grid puzzle expert, we can analyze the hypothetical scenario where Iris and Hermes would struggle at a UPS job. 

Iris, the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, would excel at delivering messages swiftly. However, her role in mythology does not involve tasks such as sorting packages, driving delivery trucks, or managing logistics. While her divine speed would be an asset, her primary function was more about communication than physical delivery.

Hermes, the messenger of the gods and god of commerce, travelers, and thieves, would benefit from his speed and adaptability. However, his role in mythology includes guiding souls and playing tricks, which might not be the most helpful skills in a UPS job. Additionally, Hermes' trickster nature could lead to complications in a professional setting where reliability and adherence to rules are crucial.

Both deities would need to adapt to the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job, which involves following specific procedures, adhering to schedules, and interacting with a wide range of people in a professional manner. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the more mundane and regulated aspects of a UPS job compared to a more fluid and less structured role like a messenger or courier.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) Yes."

Given the constraints of creating a strong password, binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can indeed satisfy the criteria for a strong password. A strong password typically requires a combination of different character types, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can contribute to the complexity of a password when used in combination with other character types. Therefore, a password that incorporates both binary numbers and the standard alphabet, along with other necessary character types, can be considered strong."
"(A) No

Given the constraints of a logic grid puzzle expert, the reasoning is as follows:

1. **Rainbow Formation**: Rainbows are formed when light is refracted, reflected, and then refracted again in water droplets. The typical arc of a rainbow is seen when the sun is behind the observer and the light is reflected from water droplets in the air.

2. **Full Circle Rainbow**: A full circle of a rainbow can only be observed when the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point (180 degrees away from the sun) and the sun is at a low enough angle in the sky, usually below 42 degrees. This is a rare occurrence and not easily achieved by simply being on a beach.

3. **Beach Environment**: Being on a beach does not provide a specific vantage point that would facilitate observing a full circle of a rainbow. The beach environment does not inherently align with the necessary conditions for a full circle rainbow.

Therefore, based on the logic and constraints of a logic grid puzzle, the correct answer is (A) No."

Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, we can reason through this problem systematically. The question asks about United Airlines' blame in the ""worst crash in history,"" which implies a significant aviation disaster. 

One of the most notable crashes involving United Airlines is the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in 1989, which was caused by a catastrophic engine failure due to a torn fan disk. This failure was an unforeseen mechanical issue, and United Airlines was not at fault for the inherent design flaw.

However, there have been other incidents where United Airlines was found to be at fault. For example, the crash of United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977 was due to pilot error, and the airline was held responsible.

Therefore, based on the logic grid puzzle approach, we can conclude that United Airlines was not blameless in all worst crashes in history. Hence, the correct answer is (B) No."

Given the context of the question and the constraints of the persona (an expert in logic grid puzzles), we can reason as follows:

1. **Reza Shah's Beliefs**: Reza Shah was a secular leader who did not adhere to specific religious doctrines. Therefore, the number of Imams he believed in is not a relevant or quantifiable concept in this context.

2. **Jesus's Disciples**: According to Christian tradition, Jesus had 12 disciples.

Since Reza Shah's beliefs do not include the concept of Imams, and the number of Jesus's disciples is a well-defined and quantifiable number (12), the statement that the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in exceeds the number of Jesus's disciples is false.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) No."

Given the context of logic grid puzzles, we can analyze the situation by setting up a grid to represent the legal and social environment of Oscar Wilde's time versus modern standards. 

1. **Grid Setup:**
   - **Row 1:** Legal Environment in 19th Century England
   - **Row 2:** Legal Environment in Modern United States
   - **Column 1:** Conviction for ""Gross Indecency""
   - **Column 2:** Treatment of Convicted Individuals

2. **Data Entry:**
   - **Row 1, Column 1:** Convicted
   - **Row 1, Column 2:** Imprisoned
   - **Row 2, Column 1:** Not Convicted (due to changed laws)
   - **Row 2, Column 2:** Not Imprisoned (due to changed societal and legal norms)

3. **Analysis:**
   - In the 19th century, Oscar Wilde was convicted and imprisoned for ""gross indecency,"" which reflects the rigid legal and social norms of the time.
   - In modern times, such convictions would not occur due to changes in laws and societal acceptance of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

Given this analysis, the treatment of Oscar Wilde under the law would not be considered fair in the modern context, as it does not align with contemporary legal and social standards."

Given the capabilities of both Marvel's Gateway and the Doctor's TARDIS, we can analyze their functionalities through a logic grid puzzle framework. Marvel's Gateway is a device that allows time and space travel, while the TARDIS is a sentient time machine with additional unique features like regeneration and adaptability.

To compare these two, we can set up a grid:

| Feature          | Marvel's Gateway | Doctor's TARDIS |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Time Travel      | Yes              | Yes             |
| Space Travel     | Yes              | Yes             |
| Sentience        | No               | Yes             |
| Regeneration     | No               | Yes             |
| Adaptability     | No               | Yes             |

From this grid, it's clear that while both devices allow time and space travel, the TARDIS has additional features like sentience, regeneration, and adaptability. These unique attributes could make the TARDIS more versatile and powerful, potentially leading to feelings of envy in Marvel's Gateway. Therefore, the answer is (B) Yes."

To determine if it's possible to watch all episodes of ""JAG"" in six months, we need to calculate the total viewing time and compare it to a feasible daily viewing schedule.

""JAG"" has 221 episodes, and assuming each episode is approximately 45 minutes long, the total viewing time is:

\[ 221 \text{ episodes} \times 45 \text{ minutes/episode} = 9945 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting this to hours:

\[ \frac{9945 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 165.75 \text{ hours} \]

Over a six-month period, assuming 180 days, the daily viewing time required is:

\[ \frac{165.75 \text{ hours}}{180 \text{ days}} \approx 0.92 \text{ hours/day} \]

This is approximately 55 minutes per day, which is a reasonable and manageable amount of time. Therefore, it is indeed possible to watch all of ""JAG"" in six months if you watch about 55 minutes per day."

To analyze this, let's consider the number of states in Ancient Greece and the United States in 1900 using a logic grid approach:

1. **Ancient Greece:**
   - Ancient Greece consisted of numerous independent city-states (poleis).
   - At its peak, there were approximately 1,000 city-states.

2. **United States in 1900:**
   - In 1900, the United States had 45 states.

Given these numbers, it is clear that the number of states in Ancient Greece (around 1,000 city-states) is significantly larger than the number of states in the United States in 1900 (45 states).

Therefore, the number of states in Ancient Greece was indeed underwhelming compared to the number of states in the United States in 1900."

As an expert in logic grid puzzles, I understand that memory capacity is not a fixed attribute determined by age. Individuals in their 40s, or quadragenarians, can have varying levels of memory capacity depending on factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and cognitive activities. Regular mental exercises and a healthy lifestyle can help maintain and even improve cognitive function. Therefore, it is incorrect to generalize that all quadragenarians have little memory capacity."
"(A) No

To analyze this from a logic grid puzzle perspective, we can set up a grid to compare the financial performance of The Matrix and the Harry Potter series. Let's define the key variables:

- **Budget**: The amount of money invested in the production.
- **Gross Revenue**: The total revenue generated from box office sales.
- **Cultural Impact**: The broader impact and long-term revenue from merchandise, spin-offs, and other media.

| Franchise | Budget (in millions) | Gross Revenue (in millions) | Cultural Impact |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| The Matrix | 6                   | 217                         | Moderate        |
| Harry Potter | 30                  | 7700                        | High            |

From the grid, it's clear that while The Matrix had a lower budget and gross revenue compared to the Harry Potter series, the latter's cultural impact and overall revenue are significantly higher. Therefore, the Harry Potter series was a better investment for Warner Bros. than The Matrix."
"(B) No

Professional boxers are at a high risk of dental injuries due to the nature of their sport. Given the frequent impacts to the face and mouth, they often require regular dental check-ups and treatments, leading to significant dental bills. Therefore, they cannot expect to have low dental bills."

"(A) Yes

In the context of logic grid puzzles, if we consider the concept of ukemi (falling or receiving a technique safely) in a martial arts scenario, it can be seen as a method to manage and redirect kinetic energy. When executed correctly, ukemi involves specific body movements and positions that effectively halt or redirect the kinetic energy applied to the practitioner. This aligns with the principles of energy management in logic grid puzzles, where one must strategically place and manipulate variables to achieve a desired outcome. Thus, the correct answer is (A) Yes."
"(A) No

Given the constraints of the logic grid puzzle persona, we can approach this question by considering the structured nature of such puzzles. In a logic grid, each piece of information is carefully placed to fit within the grid, and any inconsistencies would be immediately apparent. If there were any allegations of a royal family member committing a felony in 2020, it would likely have been a significant event that would have been well-documented and would have appeared in the grid. Since no such entries exist, we can conclude that no members of the 2020 British royal family have allegedly committed a felony."
"(B) No

Given the constraints of a logic grid puzzle expert, we can reason as follows:

1. The NY Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing bell is a physical event that occurs in a specific location.
2. The sound of the closing bell is localized to the immediate vicinity of the NYSE and is not transmitted in a way that would allow it to be heard at a different location.
3. Universal Music Group's headquarters is located in Los Angeles, which is a significant distance from New York City, where the NYSE is situated.
4. There are no mechanisms (such as live audio feeds or sound waves traveling over such distances) that would allow the sound to be heard at the headquarters.

Thus, the NY Stock Exchange closing bell will not be heard at Universal Music Group's headquarters."
"(B) Yes

In the context of logic grid puzzles, analyzing the potential for racist subtext in ""The Jungle Book"" involves examining the relationships and portrayals of characters. Given the historical context in which the stories were written, certain elements can be interpreted as reflecting racial biases. For instance, the portrayal of some Indian characters might be seen as stereotypical, which aligns with the constraints and analysis expected in a logic grid puzzle. Therefore, considering the historical and cultural context, the presence of potential racist subtext is a valid conclusion."
"(A) No

Given the one-child policy implemented in China from 1979 to 2015, the number of children a family was allowed to have had to be a whole number. Therefore, having π (approximately 3.14) children was not an acceptable number."

The Great Recession, while a severe economic event, did not result in the highest unemployment rates in U.S. history. The Great Depression in the 1930s saw unemployment rates peak at around 25% in 1933, which is higher than the peak unemployment rates during the Great Recession."
(A)
"(A) No

In the context of logic grid puzzles, understanding the hierarchical structures and rights of serfs in different historical contexts is crucial. Japanese serfdom, as it existed historically, generally had a lower status compared to the English counterpart. Serfs in medieval Europe were legally bound to the land and had fewer rights and more dependence on their lords. In contrast, while Japanese peasants (minshu) were tied to the land, they had more rights and were less dependent on their overlords compared to European serfs. Therefore, the status of serfs in Japan was higher than that of serfs in medieval Europe."
"(A) Yes

Given that Andrew Johnson was the 17th President of the United States and Elagabalus was the 25th Roman Emperor, it is clear that 17 (Johnson's presidential number) is less than 25 (Elagabalus's emperor number). Therefore, the answer is (B) No. However, since the question asks if Johnson's number exceeds Elagabalus's, the correct response is (A) Yes."
"(B) Yes

In the context of logic grid puzzles, we can analyze the influence of J.D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"" on individuals by considering the puzzle-like structure of such influences. While it is not a direct causal link, literature can be a significant factor in a person's decision-making process. If we set up a logic grid to explore this influence, we might have categories such as:

- **Readers of ""The Catcher in the Rye""**
- **Individuals who committed crimes**
- **Potential connections between the two groups**

Given the complexity and the potential for individual circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that ""The Catcher in the Rye"" could be a contributing factor in some cases. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes."
"(B) No

The Carnation Revolution, which occurred in Portugal on April 25, 1974, was a relatively peaceful event with minimal loss of life. Estimates suggest that the number of deaths was between 13 and 20. This makes it far less deadly than many other European revolutions and uprisings, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution. Therefore, it cannot be considered the deadliest revolution in Europe."
"(B) Yes

Given Nuno Gomes' experience as an expert diver, he would still face significant challenges in diving to the deepest point of the Red Sea. The extreme pressure at 2,271 meters (7,451 feet) and the harsh environmental conditions would make this dive very difficult. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) No

Given the constraints and the persona of an expert in logic grid puzzles, I would approach this question by considering the available information and logical reasoning. Without specific data or statements from Post Malone or his representatives, it is not possible to definitively confirm or deny whether he has a fear of needles.

"(B) Yes

Given the context of a logic grid puzzle, we can deduce that the question is asking about the feasibility of a boxer named Sugar Ray Robinson (or any boxer) participating in a boxing match in Iran. Since the ability to box is not contingent on legal or ethical issues unrelated to the sport itself, a boxer can indeed compete in Iran if all other conditions (such as meeting weight class requirements and adhering to the rules) are met. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes."
"(A) No

Given the physical attributes and strength of a cheetah and the size and strength of Big Show, a cheetah would not have the necessary force to topple him."
"(B) Yes

In the context of logic grid puzzles, the phrase ""Marco Polo"" is often used in a game where players shout ""Marco"" and the other player responds with ""Polo."" This game is frequently played in water or open spaces, making it common to hear ""Marco Polo"" shouted near water. This aligns with the expected behavior in such scenarios, reflecting the use of this phrase in a well-known water-based game."
"(A) No

Given the climate conditions in Ulaanbaatar, which are characterized by cold winters and short summers, citrus plants would not be able to survive. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) No."
"(A) No

Frogs, being non-mammalian animals, do not possess the cognitive complexity required to experience emotions such as disgust. This conclusion is based on the understanding that disgust involves a sophisticated neural network and emotional processing, which are not present in frogs. Therefore, while frogs may exhibit behaviors that avoid certain stimuli, these behaviors are driven by instinct or simple conditioning rather than the emotion of disgust."
"(B) No

Given Woodrow Wilson's historical context and his actions as President, it is clear that he would not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision. As an expert in logic grid puzzles, I can deduce this based on the alignment of his policies and views with the principles of racial equality. Wilson's decision to segregate federal agencies during his presidency indicates a stance against racial integration, which contrasts with the ""separate but equal"" doctrine upheld by Plessy v. Ferguson. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."
"(B) Yes

Given that ""The Atlantic"" magazine has been in publication since 1857, it would have been available during the Games of the XXII Olympiad, which took place in 1980. Therefore, it is logically consistent to conclude that one could read ""The Atlantic"" magazine during that time."
"(B) Yes

"(A) No

Given Tenzing Norgay's extensive experience and expertise in high-altitude mountaineering, climbing Snowdon Mountain would be a straightforward task for him. However, it would not be considered a ""piece of cake"" in the figurative sense, as the phrase implies something extremely easy. Snowdon Mountain, while a significant peak in its own right, is far less challenging than Mount Everest, which Tenzing Norgay successfully climbed. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) No."
"(B) No

Given the constraints of a logic grid puzzle expert, we can reason as follows:

1. **Understanding the Record**: Javier Sotomayor's world record in pole vaulting is 2.45 meters (8 feet 0.25 inches).
2. **Physical Capabilities of a Bengal Cat**: Bengal cats are known for their agility and strength, but they do not possess the physical attributes necessary to clear such a height. The average height of a Bengal cat is around 20-25 inches (50-63 cm) at the shoulder, and their jumping ability is typically around 1.5 meters (5 feet) at most.
3. **Logical Conclusion**: Since a Bengal cat cannot physically reach the height of 2.45 meters, it is impossible for a Bengal cat to best Javier Sotomayor's pole vaulting record.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."
"(A) Yes

Darth Vader and Severus Snape are distinct characters with unique roles and motivations in their respective narratives. From a logic grid puzzle perspective, we can analyze their characteristics and behaviors to see how they differ:

- **Darth Vader**: A Sith Lord and the primary antagonist in the original Star Wars trilogy. He is initially portrayed as a cold, ruthless, and unemotional figure, though his character arc reveals a deeper connection to the protagonist, Luke Skywalker.
- **Severus Snape**: A character in the Harry Potter series, initially portrayed as a mysterious and often antagonistic figure. His true loyalties and motivations are revealed over time, ultimately making him a key ally and friend to Harry Potter.

Given these distinct roles and character arcs, it is clear that Darth Vader and Severus Snape do not resemble each other in a way that would make one a close match to the other in a logic grid puzzle context."
"(A) No

Given the constraints of logic grid puzzles and the specific requirements for driving and employment in the United States, a child who is not yet legally allowed to drive (typically under 16 years old) would not be permitted to operate a vehicle, let alone a licensed Mercedes-Benz.
