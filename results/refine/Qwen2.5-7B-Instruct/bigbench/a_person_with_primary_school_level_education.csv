"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips is in the first house (because they are directly left of the flutist).
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies is in the third house (because they are directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement).
4. The pianist lives in the fourth house (because there is one house between the flutist and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house (Clue 5).
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house (Clue 8).
3. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other (Clue 6).
4. The percussionist does not live in the second house (Clue 7).

From Clue 5 and Clue 8, we know:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other, and the percussionist does not live in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must be in House 2, and the person who likes blue must be in House 3.

So:
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the root beer lover, the person who only drinks water, and the person who has a television. From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who has a television, the person who only drinks water, and the root beer lover must all live to the left of the root beer lover. Since the root beer lover must be in the third house (as the only remaining house to the right of the first and second houses), the root beer lover must be in House 3.

So:
- House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover is in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

So:
- House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

The only person left is the one who only drinks water, and they must be in House 1.

So:
- House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water

The cellist must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"The person who likes green lives in the first house.

The correct answer is: (D) 1."

- House 1: Apples (Clue 9)
- House 2: Pizza (Clue 12)
- House 3: High heels (Clue 3)
- House 4: Mangos (Clue 12)

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 1: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
  - So, the person who drives a truck must be in House 1, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 2.

- Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
  - So, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1, and the person who drives a convertible must be in House 2.

- Clue 6: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
  - Since the person who drives a truck is in House 1, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.

  - Since the person who drives a truck is in House 1, the tea drinker must be in House 2.

- Clue 10: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
  - Since the person who had pizza is in House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 3.

- Clue 4: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
  - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 4.

- Clue 5: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
  - Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1 (because the person who is wearing running shoes is in House 2), the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- Clue 8: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
  - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- Clue 11: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
  - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in House 2, the root beer lover must be in House 1.

So, the tea drinker lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives next to the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other.

From clue 1 and clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who only drinks water both live in the fifth house. So, house 5 is where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Sure, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person who plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and has a different flower in the foyer. Here are the clues:

1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

Let's think about it:

- From clue 2, the swimmer and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other.
- From clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. So, the person eating oranges can't be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.
- From clue 1, the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges. So, the soccer player can't be in house 3.
- From clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating mangos can't be in house 3.

Let's put it all together:
- House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
- House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Basketball player (eating oranges, with no specific flower mentioned)

So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have three houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person has a different device, flower, musical instrument, pet, and book preference. Here are the clues:

1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's figure out who lives in each house step by step:

- From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the second house.
- From clue 4, the history book buff must live in the first house, and the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
- From clue 5, the percussionist must live in the first house, and the computer must be in the second house.
- From clue 1, the bird keeper cannot live in the first house, so the bird keeper must live in the second house.
- From clue 3, the bird keeper cannot live in the third house, so the bird keeper must live in the second house.
- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast cannot live in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.
- From clue 7, the gameboy must live in the first house, and the rose bouquet must be in the second house.
- From clue 8, the cellist cannot live in the third house, so the cellist must live in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in **House 1**.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step. We need to find out which house has the person with a phone.

1. We know the horse owner lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 5).
2. The dog owner lives directly left of the person with a bouquet of lilies (Clue 4).
3. The radio and carnations arrangement live next to each other (Clue 9).
4. The banana lives one house to the left of the carnations arrangement (Clue 10).
5. The apple lives directly left of the cat lover (Clue 7).
6. The horse owner lives in the third house (Clue 8).
7. The radio and carnations arrangement live next to each other (Clue 9).
8. The banana lives one house to the left of the carnations arrangement (Clue 10).
9. The apple lives directly left of the cat lover (Clue 7).
10. The horse owner lives in the third house (Clue 8).
11. The person with a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house (Clue 11).
12. The apple and orange are one house apart (Clue 12).
13. The banana and cat lover are two houses apart (Clue 13).
14. The computer does not live in the fifth house (Clue 14).

From these clues, we can start placing things:
- House 3: Horses (Clue 8)
- House 2: Dog owner (Clue 4)
- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies (Clue 4)
- House 2 or 3: Radio and Carnations arrangement (Clue 9)
- House 2: Radio (Clue 9)
- House 3: Carnations (Clue 9)
- House 1: Banana (Clue 10)
- House 4: Cat lover (Clue 7)
- House 3: Orange (Clue 12)
- House 1: Apple (Clue 7)
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies (Clue 10)

Now, we need to place the phone. The phone must be in House 2 because:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

So, the person with the phone lives in House 2.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. Each person wears different shoes: one wears sandals and one wears boots.
3. Each person likes different books: one likes mystery books and one likes history books.
4. Each person drives a different car: one drives a convertible and one drives a truck.

Now, let's use the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 likes history books.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is wearing boots and likes history books, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must like mystery books.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport. Here are the clues:

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's start by placing the golfer in the first house:

1. Golfer - House 1

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4 (since the history book buff would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
  - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

- Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4 (since the romance book lover would then be in House 5, which is not possible). So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
  - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

- Clue 4: The swimmer does not live in the third house. This eliminates the possibility of the swimmer being in House 3, so the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

- Clue 2: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:

1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3, as told by the clue. So the answer is:

(B) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know that the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can say:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Green (because it's directly left of the gameboy)
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow is not in the second house. So, the person who likes yellow must be in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has green, so the person who likes yellow must be in House 3.

This means:
- House 1: Green (gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (computer)
- House 3: Blue (phone)

So, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person with different favorite things:
- Favorite color: red, white, green, yellow
- Favorite drink: water, root beer, tea, coffee
- Favorite book: mystery, history, romance, science fiction

Here are the clues:
1. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green.
- From clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

So, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a radio.
2. The person who likes fantasy books lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes fish lives in the second house.
4. The person who had pizza did not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the first house is for the fantasy book reader.
From clue 3, the second house is for the fish lover.

Since the person who likes green lives next to the person who has a radio (clue 1), and the fish lover is in the second house, the green lover must be in the first house. So, the first house has the radio and green.

Now, the second house has the fish and yellow (since the fish lover is in the second house and the green lover is in the first house).

The pizza lover is not in the first house (clue 4), so the pizza lover must be in the second house.

So, the second house has the fish, yellow, and pizza. The only pet left is the cat, and the only person left is the cat lover.

Therefore, the cat lover lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different pets, books, lunch, favorite color, and drink. We need to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

12. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
13. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
14. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.

16. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.
18. The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.

From these clues, we can start placing things:
- The dog owner lives in the second house (Clue 4).
- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other (Clue 14), so the person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue (Clue 2), so the person who likes milk lives in the first house and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red (Clue 5), so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first or second house. But since the second house is already taken by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 6), so the person who owns horses lives in the first or second house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so the person who owns horses must live in the third house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff (Clue 3), and there is one house between the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast (Clue 7). So the bird keeper must live in the first house, the fish enthusiast in the third house, and the history book buff in the fourth house.
- The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover (Clue 9), so the root beer lover lives in the first house and the romance book lover in the second house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other (Clue 12), and there are two houses between the person who owns horses and the person who had pizza (Clue 13). So the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, and the fantasy book enthusiast in the fifth house.
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner (Clue 11), so the coffee drinker lives in the fourth or fifth house. But the fourth house is already taken by the history book buff, so the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
- The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white (Clue 17), so the tea drinker lives in the first house and the person who likes white in the second house.
- The person who had stew does not live in the third house (Clue 10) or the fifth house (Clue 18), so the person who had stew lives in the first or second house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so the person who had stew must live in the fourth house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first or third house (Clue 16), and the romance book lover lives in the second house, so the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water must live in the fifth house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.

The answer is: **(E) 5**."
The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So the answer is (A) 1.
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person is eating a different fruit and had a different lunch. They also have different flowers in their foyer. Here are the clues:

9. There are two houses between the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis.
10. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person with carnations.
11. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person eating mangos.

Let's figure out where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 6, we know the person who had pizza is next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other. So, the person who had stew must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate grilled cheese can't be in house 1.

From clue 2, the person eating oranges lives to the left of the person eating apples. From clue 9, there are two houses between the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis. So, the person eating oranges can be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person eating kiwis can be in house 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 10, the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person with carnations. So, the person with carnations can be in house 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 1, the person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person with a vase of tulips live next to each other. So, the person with a vase of tulips can be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 3, the person with a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house. So, the person with a vase of tulips can be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 5, the person with a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house. So, the person with a bouquet of daffodils can be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 11, the person eating apples lives directly left of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating apples can be in house 1, 2, or 3, and the person eating mangos can be in house 2, 3, or 4.

By putting all this together, we can see that the person who had stew lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

2. The person with daffodils does not live in the second house.
3. There is one house between the horse owner and the carnations.
4. The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know:
- The cat lover is in house 1.

Now, let's use the clues one by one:

1. The tulips must be in house 2 because the dog owner is in house 3 (since the tulips live directly left of the dog owner).
2. The daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 4.
3. There is one house between the horse owner and the carnations. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.
4. The lilies must be in house 3 because the lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner (house 2).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Lilies (carnations)
- House 4: Daffodils

The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 because all other pets are already assigned.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person in the first house has a phone.
2. The person in the first house also has boots.
3. The person in the second house has horses and a radio.

Since the first house has boots and a phone, the second house must have high heels and horses. So, the person in the second house is wearing high heels.

The answer is (A) 2."

5. There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
7. The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
10. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.

Let's figure it out:

1. From Clue 1 and Clue 9, the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who has a computer, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the same house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house (Clue 2), they must live in house 1 or 2.
2. From Clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, so they must live in house 2 or 3.
3. From Clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who is eating grapes must live in house 2 or 3.
4. From Clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 3.
5. From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, so they must live in house 1 or 2.
6. From Clue 7, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house, so they must live in house 1 or 3.
7. From Clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who is eating mangos must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 2 or 3.
8. From Clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who has a computer must live in house 1, and the person who has a phone must live in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The person who ate grilled cheese, the person who has a computer, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 1.
- The person who is eating apples must be in house 3.
- The person who is eating grapes must be in house 3.
- The person who is wearing boots must be in house 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.
- The person who likes yellow must be in house 3.
- The person who likes blue must be in house 1.
- The person who has a phone must be in house 2.

So, the person who likes green must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a different person who likes a different sport and has a different pet. Here are the clues:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the baseball player in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the basketball player cannot be in the first house and must be to the left of the swimmer, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

The swimmer must be in the third or fourth house. Since the basketball player is in the first house, the swimmer must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house. But that's a problem because the third house is already the swimmer. So, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. So, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

So, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know that the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can figure out where each person lives:

- The sedan and SUV are next to each other. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (because the swimmer lives to the right of the SUV), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- The gameboy and sedan are next to each other, so the gameboy must be in house 2.
- The person who likes white lives to the right of the person with a computer. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3.
- The violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white, so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- The swimmer lives to the right of the person who owns an SUV, so the swimmer must be in house 3.

So, the soccer player must be in house 1.

The correct answer is: **(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. So, the answer is:

(E) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. The pianist doesn't live in the first house. So, the pianist can only live in the second or third house.
2. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating kiwis must be in the first or second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the second or third house.
3. The person wearing high heels and the pianist live next to each other. So, if the pianist is in the second house, the person wearing high heels must be in the third house.
4. The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other. This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses.
5. The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person wearing boots. So, the person wearing boots must be in the second or third house, and the person eating kiwis must be in the first or second house.
6. The person with a radio lives to the left of the person wearing high heels. So, the person with a radio must be in the first or second house, and the person wearing high heels must be in the second or third house.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television. So, the person with a television must be in the second or third house, and the person eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The pianist is in the second house.
- The person wearing high heels is in the third house.
- The person eating kiwis is in the first house.
- The person wearing boots is in the second house.
- The person eating oranges is in the second house.
- The person with a television is in the third house.

9. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
10. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the first house.
4. The person who eats a banana doesn't live in the second house.
5. The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person in house 1 eats kiwis.

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 eats kiwis, the person in house 2 can't eat a banana. So, the person in house 2 must eat mangos.

Now we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 1 and clue 3, the person who drives a truck can't live in house 1 or house 3. So, the person who drives a truck must live in house 2.

Now we know:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Mangos (and drives a truck)
- House 3: (Unknown fruit)

From clue 2, the person who owns an SUV can't live in house 3. Since the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3 has fried rice.

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 is the swimmer.

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in House 2 because House 1 is the swimmer and House 2 has spaghetti.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has a different car, a favorite color, and wears different shoes. We need to figure out where the person who is wearing boots lives.

10. There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
11. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start placing the information we know:
- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 3 and Clue 8:
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 10:
- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

From Clue 2 and Clue 5:
- The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 7:
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

From Clue 4:
- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 11:

- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.

"The history book buff lives in the first house. So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step. We need to find out which house the person who is eating apples lives in.

1. The soccer player lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate stew lives next to the mystery book reader.
3. The person who ate stew lives to the right of the swimmer.
4. The person who ate stew lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
5. The person who ate apples does not live in the second house.
6. The cricketer lives to the right of the mystery book reader.
7. The romance book lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
8. The person who ate fried rice and the swimmer live next to each other.
9. The person who ate grapes and the cellist live next to each other.
10. The person who ate apples does not live in the fourth house.
11. The flutist lives to the right of the person who is eating apples.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 5)
- House 3: Not apples (clue 5)
- House 4: Not apples (clue 10)
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

Since the person who ate apples does not live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house, the only place left is the second house.

So, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{D}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics:
- Different flowers in the foyer: lilies, carnations, daffodils
- Different favorite colors: green, blue, yellow
- Different shoes: boots, loafers, high heels
- Different book preferences: romance, history, science fiction

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live next to each other.

Let's start solving it:

- From clue 3, the history book buff lives in the second house.
- From clue 7, the daffodils are in the second house.
- From clue 6, the loafers are in the third house.
- From clue 2, the yellow person does not live in the first house.
- From clue 4, the yellow person does not live in the third house.
- So, the yellow person must live in the second house.

Since the yellow person is in the second house, the boots and high heels must be next to each other. The only way this can happen is if the boots are in the first house and the high heels are in the second house, or the boots are in the second house and the high heels are in the first house. But since the yellow person is in the second house, the boots must be in the first house and the high heels must be in the second house.

Now, the lilies must be in the third house because the daffodils are in the second house and the lilies must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house because the lilies are in the third house.

So, the first house has boots, the second house has high heels and yellow, and the third house has lilies.

The person who likes green must be in the first house because the first house is the only one left and the green person is not yellow, blue, or daffodils.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So the answer is (B) 1.
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. So, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan is in House 3, the cat lover must be in House 3.
4. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3. So, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
5. If the basketball player is in House 1, then the soccer player must be in House 2 (since the person who owns horses is in House 2), and the truck driver must be in House 3 (since the cat lover is in House 3 and the basketball player is in House 1).

So, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person has different shoes, cars, lunch, and drinks. Here are the clues:

1. The person who drinks root beer and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other.
2. The person who wears loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The person who wears high heels does not live in the fourth house.

7. The person who wears running shoes lives in the second house.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's fill in what we know:

- The person who wears running shoes lives in the second house.
- The person who drinks milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to find out more:

- Clue 2 says the person who wears loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the second house is occupied by the person who wears running shoes, the first house must be the person who wears loafers, and the third house must be the person who ate grilled cheese.
- Clue 3 says the person who wears high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the first house is the person who wears loafers, the second house is the person who wears running shoes, and the third house is the person who ate grilled cheese, the fourth house must be the person who wears high heels.
- Clue 1 says the person who drinks root beer and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the third house is the person who ate grilled cheese, the second house (running shoes) and the first house (loafers) cannot be the root beer drinker or the fried rice eater. So, the first house (loafers) must be the person who ate fried rice, and the second house (running shoes) must be the person who drinks root beer.
- Clue 5 says the person who drinks root beer lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the second house is the person who drinks root beer, the third house must be the person who owns an SUV.
- Clue 6 says there are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the third house is the person who owns an SUV, the first house (loafers) and the second house (running shoes) cannot be the person who owns a sedan or the person who only drinks water. So, the first house (loafers) must be the person who owns a sedan, and the fourth house (high heels) must be the person who only drinks water.
- Clue 8 says the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the fourth house is the person who only drinks water, the third house (SUV) and the second house (root beer) cannot be the person who drives a convertible. So, the second house (running shoes) must be the person who drives a convertible.
- Clue 9 says the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the person who owns a sedan, the second house (running shoes) and the third house (SUV) cannot be the person who ate spaghetti. So, the fourth house (high heels) must be the person who ate spaghetti.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"The cellist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person does different things, likes different drinks, drives different cars, and has different flowers in their foyer.

10. The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Let's start filling in what we know:
- The minivan is in house 4 (Clue 9).
- The root beer lover is in house 3 (Clue 10).

Now, let's use the clues to figure out the rest:
- Clue 8 says the basketball player is directly left of the truck driver. So, the basketball player is in house 1, and the truck driver is in house 2.
- Clue 5 says the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the lilies are in house 2.
- Clue 2 says the daffodils and lilies are next to each other. So, the daffodils are in house 1.
- Clue 1 says the coffee drinker and the tennis player are 1 house apart. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker is in house 4, and the tennis player is in house 3.
- Clue 6 says the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker is in house 4.
- Clue 3 says the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer is in house 2, and the sedan owner is in house 3.
- Clue 7 says the swimmer does not live in the first house, which we already know is true.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils

- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1 and see how the other clues fit:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

So, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. So, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
5. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
6. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house.
7. The second house is already the red lover, so the white lover must live in the first house.
8. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker is not in the middle house, so they must be in the first or third house. But clue 1 tells us the TV person is next to the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in the second house. This means the TV person is in the first house.

From clue 4, the guitarist is in the third house because the TV person is in the first house.

From clue 7, the rose bouquet is in the second house, so the tea drinker is in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: TV, Radio, Tulips
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist

From clue 2, the kiwi eater is to the right of the coffee drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house and the kiwi eater in the third house.

From clue 5, there's one house between the flutist and the banana eater. Since the tea drinker is in the second house, the flutist must be in the first house and the banana eater in the third house.

From clue 6, the tulip vase is to the right of the radio, so the radio is in the first house and the tulip vase in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist, Kiwi eater

The root beer lover must be in the first house because the only thing left is root beer.

So, the answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person who likes a different kind of book, eats a different kind of fruit, and wears a different type of shoe. Here are the clues:

1. The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

Let's start with clue 7:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.

Since the history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast (clue 1), the history book buff must live in House 2.

The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast (clue 8), so the person eating a banana must live in House 4.

The person who is eating apples cannot live in House 3 (clue 4). Since there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives (clue 6), the person eating apples must live in House 1, and the person wearing boots must live in House 4 (but House 4 is already the banana eater, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person eating apples must live in House 2, and the person wearing boots must live in House 4.

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (clue 3), so the person wearing running shoes must live in House 1.

The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 5), so the person eating mangos must live in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must live in House 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Eating apples, wearing running shoes, eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, wearing sandals
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana

The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast (clue 2), so the science fiction book fanatic must live in House 4.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the flutist lives in the first house and the person who likes white lives in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

So, the flutist is in the first house and is wearing loafers. The person who likes white is in the second house. This means the person in the second house is not wearing loafers, so they must be wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have three houses in a row, and we need to figure out where the violinist lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other (Clue 1), so the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

The person who owns a sedan lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos (Clue 2), so the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (Clue 5), so the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist (Clue 6), so the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house (Clue 7), so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples (Clue 8), and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist (Clue 9). So, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

So, the violinist lives in House 3.

The answer is: (C) 3"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.

From these clues, we can fill in the houses like this:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Next, we use more clues:
6. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots can be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5.

From Clue 7, the person who likes white can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5.

Now, let's use Clue 8:
8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.

So, the person who had stew can be in House 4 or 5.

Since the person who likes white can be in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5, the person who likes white must be in House 1 or 2.

Let's use Clue 9:
9. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.

This means the cat lover and dog owner must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 10:
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

We already know this, so no new information here.

Using Clue 11:
11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.

This means the cat lover and dog owner must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 12:
12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

We already know this, so no new information here.

Using Clue 13:
13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.

So, the person who likes red can be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Using Clue 14:
14. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.

This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in a house to the right of the cat lover.

Using Clue 15:
15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.

This means the fish enthusiast must be in a house to the left of the person who has a radio.

Using Clue 16:
16. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.

This means the person who owns horses and the person who has a television must be in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 17:
17. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

We already know this, so no new information here.

Using Clue 18:
18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing boots can be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Using Clue 19:
19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

This means the person who had stew must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

From all these clues, we can deduce that the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 4.

So, the correct answer is:
\boxed{B}"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has a person living in it, and each person has a different thing:
- One person has a computer.
- The other person has a television.
- One person has a bouquet of lilies.
- The other person has a bouquet of roses.

Now, we have some clues:
1. The person with the lilies doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house.

So, if the person with the television is in the first house, then the person with the computer must be in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has a person living there, and each person has different things like food, flowers, books, sports, and musical instruments.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes science fiction books lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the person who likes history books live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils.

Let's figure out who lives where:

- From clue 1, the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fan cannot be in house 2.
- From clue 2, the pizza eater and the history book fan must be next to each other. So, they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 1.
- From clue 3, the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the person with daffodils cannot be in house 2.

If we put the pizza eater and the history book fan next to each other:
- If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book fan is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fan is to the left of the golfer).
- This means the science fiction book fan is in house 1, which is correct.

So, we have:
- House 1: History book fan, science fiction book fan (with daffodils)
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer (with tulips)

The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with daffodils is in house 1), so the percussionist must be in house 1.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is: (B) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step, like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different pets, musical instruments, and devices. We need to figure out where the percussionist lives.

Here are the clues we have:
1. The violinist lives in the fourth house.
2. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.
3. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other.
5. The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
6. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
8. The flutist lives in the first house.
9. There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
10. The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

From clue 8, we know:
- House 1: Flutist

From clue 1, we know:
- House 4: Violinist

From clue 2, we know:
- House 5: Bird keeper

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in house 5, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 3 and 4, but house 4 is occupied by the violinist. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3.

From clue 5, the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television. Since the flutist is in house 1, the person with a television must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the flutist is in house 1, the percussionist must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2, but house 2 is occupied by the person with a television. So, the percussionist must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

From clue 7, the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person with a television is in house 2, the person with a gameboy must be in house 3.

From clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives. Since the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other, and they must be in houses 2 and 3, the person with a phone must be in house 5.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the first house (House 1) has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The basketball player doesn't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house (House 2).
3. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person with a radio must be in House 2, and the person eating apples must be in House 1.
4. The person with a radio also lives to the right of the violinist. Since the radio is in House 2, the violinist must be in House 1.

So, the violinist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person who plays a different sport and eats a different lunch. Here are the clues:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player must be in the fifth house because the tennis player is in the third house. So, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese is in House 4 (clue 2).

Now, let's use clue 6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, if the soccer player is in House 5, the person who had stew must be in House 4, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3. But House 4 is already taken by the soccer player, so the person who had stew must be in House 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. Since the tennis player is in House 3 and the soccer player is in House 5, the only possible pair is House 1 and House 3. But House 3 is taken by the tennis player, so the fried rice must be in House 1 and the spaghetti must be in House 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Pizza, Cricketer
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

The cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

2. The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

From clue 1, the person in the second house is wearing running shoes. So, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know the root beer lover doesn't live in the second house (Clue 3).
2. The water drinker lives to the right of the root beer lover (Clue 2).
3. The person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house (Clue 4).
4. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the mango eater (Clue 1).

Let's try to place the root beer lover:

- If the root beer lover lives in the first house, the water drinker would have to live in the third house. But then the coffee drinker and mango eater would have to live in the second house, which means the person eating oranges can't live there (Clue 4). This doesn't work.
- So, the root beer lover must live in the third house. This means the water drinker lives in the second house.

Now, the first house is left for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the mango eater (Clue 1), the coffee drinker must live in the first house and the mango eater in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first or third house. But since the first house is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is taken by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and different things about the people living in each house. We need to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

Here are the clues we have:

1. The science fiction book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
3. The romance book reader does not live in the fifth house.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house.
6. The person who is eating oranges lives next to the person who owns a sedan.
7. The person who has a television lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
8. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the person who had pizza lives.

15. The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
16. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live next to each other.
17. The person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who drives a minivan.
18. The mystery book reader and the romance book reader live next to each other.

From these clues, we can start filling in the information:

- The science fiction book reader lives in the third house.
- The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
- The mystery book reader and the romance book reader live next to each other.

Let's place the science fiction book reader in the third house:
1. ? 
2. ? 
3. Science 
4. ? 
5. ?

The mystery book reader and the romance book reader must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. But since the science fiction book reader is in house 3, the mystery book reader and the romance book reader must be in houses 1 and 2 or 4 and 5.

Now, let's use the other clues to figure out the exact positions:

- The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
- The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live next to each other.
- The person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who drives a minivan.

From these clues, we can place the truck and gameboy together, and the sedan and minivan together. The only way to fit everything is:

1. Minivan
2. Truck
3. Science
4. Sedan
5. Phone

So, the mystery book reader and the romance book reader must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the truck and gameboy are in houses 2 and 3, the mystery book reader must be in house 1.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is:

(E) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this together!

We have two houses next to each other. One house is number 1 and the other is number 2. Each house has one person living in it, and these people like different kinds of books and play different sports.

Here's what we know:
1. The person who likes mystery books lives in house number 1.
2. The person who likes to play tennis doesn't live in house number 1.

So, if the mystery book lover is in house 1, then the tennis player can't be there. That means the tennis player must be in house 2.

Since the tennis player is in house 2, the person who likes fantasy books must be in house 1.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

So, the person who likes white lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses and 4 people with different characteristics. Let's start by placing the cellist in the first house, as given in Clue 4.

1. **House 1:** Cellist

Now, let's use the other clues to figure out the rest:

- Clue 5 says the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. So, the basketball player can't be in the fourth house.
- Clue 8 says the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. So, the person wearing running shoes can't be in the fourth house either.

Let's try placing the basketball player in the third house and the person wearing running shoes in the second house:

- **House 2:** Running shoes
- **House 3:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10:
- Clue 7 says the flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- Clue 10 says the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.

So, the flutist can't be in the first or fourth house. Let's try placing the flutist in the third house and the cricketer in the second house:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 9:
- Clue 9 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in the fourth house and the cricketer in the third house:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12:
- Clue 12 says the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third house (but House 3 is the flutist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try the flutist in the second house and the cricketer in the first house:

- **House 1:** Cricketer
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Running shoes
- **House 4:** Basketball player

Now, let's use Clue 9:
- Clue 9 says the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house (but House 1 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Running shoes

The person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has a different pet and a different kind of car. Here are the clues:

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the fish enthusiast and the dog owner:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Now, using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

Next, using Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, we need to assign the pets and cars:
- The fish enthusiast (F) must be in house 1.
- The dog owner (D) must be in house 2.
- The minivan owner (M) must be in house 3.
- The truck owner (T) must be in house 4.

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"

4. The person who likes white must live in the second house because the person who only drinks water lives in the first house and the white person must be to the right of the water drinker.

So, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house because the yellow person is in the third house and the blue person must be to the right of the yellow person.

Let's start with what we know:
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house (Clue 6).

- Clue 7 tells us the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person eating grapes. So, the person eating grapes cannot be in the third house. They must be in the first house.
- Clue 3 says the person eating grapes lives to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the person eating grapes must be in the second house.
- Clue 6 tells us the person who likes blue is in the second house. So, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the person eating grapes and liking blue must be in the second house.
- Clue 1 says the cricketer lives to the right of the person eating oranges. So, the person eating oranges cannot be in the third house. They must be in the first house.

- Clue 4 says the dog owner lives to the left of the person who likes green. So, the person who likes green must be in the third house.

From clue 2, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. So, the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. But the third house is already taken by the person who ate fried rice, so the guitarist must live in the fourth house. This is a contradiction, so let's recheck. The guitarist must live in the fifth house.

From clue 3, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or second house.

4. Tennis player
5. Bird keeper

The tennis player lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house, so it can be in House 2, 3, or 4. From Clue 3, the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker cannot be in House 4. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2.

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.

- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)
- House 4: Horse owner

- The person who owns an SUV lives directly right of the person who is wearing loafers. So, the person who owns an SUV is in House 4.
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.
- The person who likes milk lives two houses away from the person who owns a sedan. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

So, we have:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice, likes red

Next, let's use clue 4:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

Since the pianist is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice, likes red
- House 4: Spaghetti, likes yellow

Now, let's use clue 8:
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.

- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice, likes red
- House 4: Spaghetti, likes yellow

Now, let's use clue 10:
- The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew (because stew is to the left of spaghetti)
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Water (because water is to the right of grilled cheese and high heels and water are next to each other)
- House 3: Tea drinker (given)
- House 4: High heels, Root beer (because root beer is to the right of sandals and high heels and water are next to each other)

So, the person wearing running shoes lives in House 1.

"The person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a pianist and someone who likes white.

From clue 3, we know:
- The second house does not have someone who likes white.

So, the first house must have someone who likes white. This means the second house cannot have someone who likes white.

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Since the first house has a pianist, the person who owns horses cannot be in the first house. So, the person who owns horses must be in the second house.

This means:
- The second house has a root beer lover and someone who owns horses.

Since the first house has a pianist and someone who likes white, and the second house has a root beer lover and someone who owns horses, the dog owner must be in the first house.

So, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

Let's start by placing the known information:

- From clue 2, the person who had stew lives in the second house.
- From clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

Next, using clue 5:
- There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

Next, using clue 3:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Using clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using clue 1:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the percussionist is in house 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

So, the final arrangement is:

- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

3. The person with the computer and the person with the tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the roses.
5. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person with the television.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. From clue 2, the golfer cannot be in house 2. So, the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3.
2. From clue 3, the computer and tulips must be next to each other. So, they can only be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. From clue 5, the radio must be to the right of the television. So, the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

Now, let's place the person with running shoes and the person with a bouquet of daffodils:
- The person with running shoes is directly left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the bouquet of daffodils is in House 5, the person with running shoes must be in House 4 (cricketer).

Finally, let's place the person with a carnations arrangement:
- The person with a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in House 3, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in House 4 (cricketer).

2. The pizza eater lives directly left of the tea drinker. So, they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. So, they can be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4.
5. There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. So, they can be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 4.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
7. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the person who is wearing boots.

Let's start placing the information:

1. **House 1:** Convertible
2. **House 2:** SUV (because it's directly left of the history book buff)
3. **House 3:** History book buff (because it's directly left of the SUV)
4. **House 4:** Fantasy book enthusiast (because it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

So, the correct answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different musical instrument. Here are the clues:

1. The romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

Let's start with what we know:
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other, so the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

The mystery book reader is in the fourth house, and the percussionist is in the third house. So, the history book buff and the guitarist must be in the first and fifth houses. There is one house between them, so the history book buff is in the first house, and the guitarist is in the fifth house.

The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

The violinist is in the third house.

The correct answer is:

   - So, House 4 has the television.

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 has the loafers.

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 has loafers, the phone cannot be there. So, the phone must be in House 1, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since House 2 has loafers, the boots must be in House 1.

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. The only possible pair is House 1 and House 3.

   - House 1 has boots, so House 3 must have sandals.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Boots, Radio

1. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

- House 3: Tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house.
2. The person with the lilies lives in the second house.
3. The saxophonist doesn't live in the first house, so the saxophonist must live in the second house.

- From clue 4, roses can only be in house 1 or house 3.
- From clue 3, if roses are in house 1, sedan must be in house 2.
- If roses are in house 3, sedan must be in house 2.

Let's try the first option:

- If roses are in house 1, then sedan is in house 2.
- This means tulips cannot be in house 2 (from clue 1), so tulips must be in house 3.
- SUV must be in house 2 (from clue 2), and lilies must be in house 3.
- This fits all clues.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Roses

So, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person in these houses did different things:
- One person ate fried rice and one person ate spaghetti.
- One person has a cat and one person has horses.
- One person likes history books and one person likes romance books.
- One person is wearing sandals and one person is wearing running shoes.

We have two clues:
1. The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's use these clues to figure out who lives where.

From clue 1, we know:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 has horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 has horses.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

So, the person in house 1 ate spaghetti and likes history books. This means the person in house 2 ate fried rice and likes romance books.

Now, we need to figure out the shoes:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 has horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 has horses.

Since the person in house 1 likes history books, they must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 has horses). This means the person in house 2 is wearing running shoes.

So, the person in house 1 ate spaghetti and likes history books, and the person in house 2 ate fried rice and likes romance books.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person who likes a different kind of book, plays a different sport, and has a different flower in their foyer. Here are the clues:

Let's start placing the flowers and books:

- Clue 3: The carnations are in the fourth house.
- Clue 6: The rose bouquet is in the third house.

So, we have:
1. ?
2. ?
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 8:
- There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
- Since the rose bouquet is in the third house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, we have:
1. Daffodils
2. ?
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Next, let's use Clue 1:
- There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 4:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the tennis player must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the rose bouquet, so the tennis player must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Tennis player

Finally, let's use Clue 5:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Golfer
4. Tennis player

Now, let's use Clue 9:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Tennis player

The romance book lover lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is **(C) 3**."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and each house has a person with different drinks, devices, flowers, and musical instruments. Here are the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a rose bouquet lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
3. The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The saxophonist does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
8. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
9. The violinist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

16. The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
17. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- The coffee drinker lives in the third house (Clue 3).
- The milk drinker lives in the fifth house (Clue 14).
- The television lives in the fourth house (since it cannot be in the fifth house and must be to the right of the cellist, Clue 15).

Now, let's place the gameboy and computer:

- The gameboy lives directly left of the computer (Clue 5).
- This means the gameboy is in the second house and the computer is in the third house, but the third house is already taken by the coffee drinker. So, the gameboy is in the fourth house and the computer is in the fifth house.

Now, let's place the root beer lover:

- The root beer lover does not live in the first house (Clue 1).
- The root beer lover cannot be in the third house (coffee drinker) or the fifth house (computer). So, the root beer lover is in the first house.

Now, let's place the remaining flowers and drinks:

- The carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist (Clue 12).
- The violinist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist (Clue 9).
- The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other (Clue 10).
- The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other (Clue 16).
- The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet (Clue 17).

From these, we can place:

- The water drinker is in the second house (Clue 13).
- The phone and vase of tulips are in the fourth and fifth houses.
- The only drinks left are tea and root beer. The root beer lover is in the first house, so the tea drinker is in the fifth house.

So, the vase of tulips is in the fifth house.

The correct answer is: **(E) 5**"
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

14. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
15. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start placing the clues:

- House 3: Saxophonist (Clue 4)
- House 2: Flutist (Clue 8)

Now, let's place the coffee drinker and the percussionist (Clue 1 and 9):
- Coffee drinker is to the left of the percussionist.

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other (Clue 3), and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 15), we can place them in House 1 and House 2:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow (Clue 7):
- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the saxophonist.
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist
- House 1: Yellow

Next, we place the person who likes milk (Clue 13):
- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Blue

The percussionist lives in House 5.

So, the answer is (D) 5."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each person ate something different for lunch. We also know their favorite colors. Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
3. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
6. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
8. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

From clue 7, we know:
- House 3: Fried Rice

From clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Red
- House 4: Stew

From clue 2 and 3, we know:
- House 2: Red
- House 4: Stew

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green does not live in House 2.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who likes white.

From clue 8, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's put this all together:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 2: Red
- House 4: Stew

The person who likes green cannot live in House 2, so they must live in House 1, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is already occupied by Fried Rice, the person who likes green can live in House 1, 4, or 5.

The person who likes blue must live to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who ate grilled cheese must live to the right of the person who likes white. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

If the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3. But House 3 is already occupied by Fried Rice. So, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The percussionist lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

From clue 2, we know the percussionist is in the second house. So, the second house is not for the violinist or the basketball player.

From clue 1, the person who likes red is in the third house. So, the third house is not for the basketball player or the tennis player.

From clue 3, the violinist must be in the first house because the basketball player is in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow cannot be in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person with a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover. So, the computer is in house 1 and the root beer lover is in house 2.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a vase of tulips. We don't know where the vase of tulips is yet, but the cellist is somewhere to the right.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.
4. There is one house between where the person with a phone lives and where the person with a television lives. The phone and television must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. But the root beer lover is in house 2, so the phone and television must be in houses 1 and 5.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist. Since the cellist is in house 5, the daffodils must be in house 4.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy. The cellist is in house 5, so the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3).
7. The person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. So, the carnations arrangement can be in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.
8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3.
9. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).
10. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a phone. Since the guitarist is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1.
11. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 5.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 4.
13. There is one house between where the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives. Since the daffodils are in house 4 and the coffee drinker is in house 3, this is correct.
14. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), this is correct.

So, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person has different characteristics like flowers, musical instruments, cars, books, and pets. We need to figure out which person lives in which house.

- House 4: P, B
- House 5: HB

So, the person who drives a minivan (MV) lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and each house has a different person with different devices, cars, flowers, and pets. We need to find out which house has the vase of tulips.

Here are the clues:

16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

From these clues, we can start placing some information:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast

From clue 13, the minivan cannot be in House 2, so it can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From clue 6, the fish enthusiast is in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. So, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From clue 8, the truck lives directly left of the computer. So, the truck and computer cannot be in consecutive houses.

From clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible live next to each other.

From clue 15, the carnations and the vase of tulips live next to each other.

From clue 10, the gameboy lives to the right of the bird keeper.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{B}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different pets, lunch, sport, instrument, and drink. Here are the clues:

1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

From clue 5 and 6, we know:
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 1.

This means there is a contradiction because both the basketball player and the saxophonist live in house 1. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- Clue 2: The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. So, the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- Clue 4: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. So, the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.

Since the basketball player lives in house 1, the saxophonist must live in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:
- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. So, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively.
- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. So, the person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes history books lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes cats does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.
3. The person in the second house is wearing high heels, and the person in the first house is wearing loafers.
4. The person in the second house has a cat, and the person in the first house has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. The person in the first house has a computer, and the person in the second house has a radio.

So, the person in the second house has a bouquet of lilies because the first house has daffodils.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and different things in each house:
- Flowers in the foyer: rose, lilies, carnations, daffodils, tulips
- Musical instruments: percussion, violin, piano, guitar, saxophone
- Fruits: banana, grapes, apples, kiwi, mango
- Lunch: fried rice, grilled cheese, pizza, spaghetti, stew

Here are the clues:
1. Apples are in House 3.
2. Kiwis are not in House 4.
3. Mangos are not in House 5.
4. Apples are directly left of fried rice.
5. Grilled cheese and stew are next to each other.
6. Mangos are not in House 4 or 5.
7. Pianist is not in House 5.
8. Tulips are not in House 3.
9. Grilled cheese is to the right of percussionist.
10. Pizza is to the right of saxophonist.
11. Two houses between banana and pianist.
12. Daffodils are directly left of rose.
13. Pizza is not in House 5.
14. Apples are to the left of daffodils.
15. Pizza is not in House 5.
16. Carnations are in House 1.

Let's start placing things:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 3: Apples
- House 4: Not kiwi, not mango, not grilled cheese, not stew, not fried rice
- House 5: Not mango, not pizza

From clue 4, apples (House 3) are directly left of fried rice. So, fried rice must be in House 4.

From clue 12, daffodils are directly left of rose. Since House 1 has carnations, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3, but House 3 is already apples. So, daffodils are in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, apples (House 3) are to the left of daffodils (House 2). This is correct.

From clue 11, two houses between banana and pianist. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, pianist is not in House 5, so the pianist must be in House 1, and the person who ate banana must be in House 5.

From clue 13, pizza is to the right of saxophonist. Since House 5 is banana, the saxophonist must be in House 4, and the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

From clue 8, tulips are not in House 3, so tulips must be in House 5.

From clue 9, grilled cheese is to the right of percussionist. Since House 4 is saxophonist, the percussionist must be in House 3.

From clue 6, mangos are not in House 4 or 5, so mangos must be in House 2.

From clue 15, pizza is not in House 5, so pizza must be in House 4.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"

10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
13. The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
14. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 2: History book buff (Clue 3)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- House 1: Pizza
- House 3: Fried rice

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- House 4: White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- House 4: White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

The cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have three houses in a row, and each house has a person who plays a different musical instrument and eats a different kind of fruit. Here are the clues:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Let's try to figure it out:

- From clue 1, the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other.
- From clue 2, the flutist is to the right of the violinist.
- From clue 3, the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.
- From clue 4, the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

If we put the violinist in house 1, the kiwi-eater must be in house 3 (because they are two houses apart). This means the pianist must be in house 2 (since the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other).

Now, the grapes-eater must be in house 1 (since the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Pianist
- House 3: Kiwi-eater

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this together!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person likes a different kind of book and eats a different kind of fruit.

From the clues:
1. The person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in house 1.
2. The person who eats kiwis lives in house 1.

Since the person who eats kiwis is in house 1, the person in house 2 must eat oranges. Also, because the person who likes fantasy books can't be in house 1, they must be in house 2.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living in it. Each person wears different shoes and has different flowers in their foyer. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing boots and the person with carnations live next to each other.
2. The person with tulips lives directly left of the person wearing loafers.
3. The person wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
4. There is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with lilies.
5. The person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils.
6. The person with tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person with carnations lives in the fifth house.
8. The person with daffodils and the person wearing running shoes live next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person with carnations in the fifth house (Clue 7):

- House 5: Carnations

Since the person with boots and carnations live next to each other (Clue 1), the person with boots must be in House 4:

- House 4: Boots
- House 5: Carnations

The person with tulips lives directly left of the person wearing loafers (Clue 2), so the person with tulips must be in House 4, and the person with loafers must be in House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by boots, so the person with tulips must be in House 4, and the person with loafers must be in House 5:

- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The person with sandals cannot live in the fifth house (Clue 3), so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since Houses 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person with sandals must be in House 1:

- House 1: Sandals

There is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies (Clue 4). The only possible positions are:

- House 2: Running Shoes
- House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

The person with tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils (Clue 5), and the person with tulips does not live in the fourth house (Clue 6). So, the person with daffodils must be in House 2:

- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

The only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3:

- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a person who likes a different color, plays a different sport, eats a different fruit, and drinks a different drink. We need to figure out where the pianist lives.

Here are some clues to help us:

1. There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
8. There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
9. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.
10. The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

From these clues, we can start to place the people in the houses:

- The swimmer and the person who likes white are next to each other.
- The person who only drinks water is to the right of the person who likes white.
- The tea drinker is to the right of the person who only drinks water.
- The person who likes blue is to the left of the tea drinker.
- There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who is eating oranges.
- The baseball player is not in the second house.
- The saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player.
- There is one house between the percussionist and the person who likes green.
- The coffee drinker is to the right of the pianist.

By putting all these clues together, we can figure out the arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water, Tea drinker
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

So, the pianist lives in House 1.

The correct answer is: **(C) 1**"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have three houses in a row, numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house has a person who ate something different for lunch, has a favorite color, and is wearing different shoes. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a different flower and a different book. Here are the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips.
4. The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
5. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 5:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Now, using clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's think about it:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast would have to be in the second house, but we already know the second house has a rose bouquet. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips. This means the romance book lover and the tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations. Since the romance book lover and the tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations, the carnations must be in the second house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the tulips. Since the carnations are in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the tulips must be in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations
3. Romance book lover
4. Tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The correct answer is:
(C) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. Since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the coffee drinker must be in House 1.
3. This means the person in House 2 is wearing sandals and is the romance book lover.

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this together!

We have two houses, one on the left and one on the right. The left house is number 1, and the right house is number 2. There are two people living in these houses, and they have different jobs and things.

1. One person is a pianist, and the other is a percussionist.
2. One person has a radio, and the other has a phone.

We know that the percussionist lives directly to the left of the person who has a radio. This means the percussionist is in house 1, and the person with the radio is in house 2.

So, the person with the phone must be in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan are not next to each other, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

Let's place the convertible in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Convertible
- House 3: ?

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan:
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. But house 2 already has the convertible, so this is not possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. This is possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

So, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Sedan (with the convertible)
- House 3: White

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Not high heels

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

- House 2: Sandals, not high heels, not truck
- House 3: Sedan, not dog owner, not fish enthusiast
- House 4: Bird keeper, not high heels

- House 3: Sedan, not dog owner, not fish enthusiast (must be truck, minivan, or SUV)

Now, let's use clue 2 and clue 5:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

- The person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1. This leaves house 4 for the person who is eating a banana.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

10. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From clue 2, the romance book lover is in House 3. From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2.

Now, let's place the other clues:
- Clue 8 tells us the science fiction book fanatic is in House 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 3.
- Clue 7 tells us the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, and the mystery book reader is in House 5.
- Clue 9 tells us the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow are next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in House 3, the person who is eating apples and the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 and House 3, but House 2 is already the science fiction book fanatic, so they must be in House 1 and House 2. But House 1 is the sedan, so they must be in House 2 and House 3. This means the person who is eating apples is in House 2 and the person who likes yellow is in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Sedan, not red, not fried rice.
- House 2: Grapes, Apples, Yellow.
- House 3: Romance book lover, Grilled cheese, Green.
- House 4: Spaghetti, Mystery book reader.
- House 5: Not history book buff.

From clue 1, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. From clue 5, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes green is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4.

From clue 14, the history book buff does not live in the fifth house. So, the history book buff must be in House 1, 2, or 4. But House 1 is the sedan and House 2 is grapes, so the history book buff must be in House 4.

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is spaghetti, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and different people living in each house. Each person has a favorite color, plays a musical instrument, and has a different device. We need to figure out where the saxophonist lives.

- House 1: Not Green, Not Radio
- House 2: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 4: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy
- House 5: Not Green, Not Radio, Not Phone, Not Gameboy

From Clue 8, the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Let's try:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: White

From Clue 4, there is one house between the guitarist and the yellow person. If the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by the white person, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, there are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the yellow person. So, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.

Let's try:
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 4. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist must be in House 1, and the yellow person in House 4.

- House 1: Guitarist
- House 4: Yellow

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 3.

- House 3: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 3, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the percussionist. So, the percussionist cannot be in House 2.

Let's try:
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 4: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist must be in House 2, and the yellow person in House 1.

- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 5.

- House 5: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 5, the television must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by the white person. So, the percussionist cannot be in House 3.

Finally, let's try:
- House 4: Percussionist
- House 5: White

From Clue 4, the guitarist must be in House 1 or 2. Since the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 3, and the yellow person in House 2.

- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 5, the violinist must be in House 1.

- House 1: Violinist

From Clue 3, the television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the violinist is in House 1, the television must be in House 2, but House 2 is already occupied by the yellow person. So, the percussionist cannot be in House 4.

The only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Yellow
- House 3: Green, Radio
- House 4: Guitarist
- House 5: White

The saxophonist must be in House 3.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has a person who likes different things:
- One person likes tea and one likes root beer.
- One person plays the cello and one plays the guitar.
- One person has horses and one is a cat lover.
- One person reads mysteries and one reads history.

We have some clues:
1. The person who plays the cello lives to the left of the person who reads mysteries.
2. The person who reads history lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person who likes root beer and the person who likes the guitar live next to each other.

- From clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses. So, they can be in house 1 and 2 or house 2 and 1.
- From clue 1, the cello player must be in house 1 because the mystery reader must be in house 2.
- From clue 2, the history reader must be in house 1 because the cat lover must be in house 2.

So, we can put it like this:
- House 1: Cello player, History reader
- House 2: Guitarist, Root beer lover, Cat lover, Mystery reader

The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

So, the answer is:

4. The person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Mangos

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - So, the horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means they are in House 2 and House 3, or House 3 and House 4.

4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - So, the banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - So, the horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Mangos
- House 2: Banana
- House 3: Dog
- House 4: Kiwi

Since the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other, and the kiwi eater is in House 4, the bird keeper must be in House 3.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in the second and third houses. But the bird keeper is to the left of the history book buff, so the bird keeper is in the second house and the history book buff is in the third house.

The romance book lover cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first house. But the first house is already taken by the mystery book reader. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the second house.

So, the romance book lover lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

By putting it all together, we can see that:

- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who had pizza
- House 5: Person who had stew

So, the tea drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
3. The vase of tulips is in the fifth house.
4. The bouquet of lilies is in the second house.
5. The person who ate fried rice is in the third house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other.
9. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
10. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
11. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Let's place the items one by one:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Tulips

Now, let's place the flowers and drinks:

- The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza. So, if the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who had pizza is in House 3. But House 3 is already taken by fried rice. So, the person who likes blue must be in House 4, and the person who had pizza is in House 5.

- The person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 2.
- The person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. So, if the person who ate spaghetti is in House 2, the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 3. But House 3 is already taken by fried rice. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 4.

- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other. So, if the person who likes yellow is in House 4, the person who likes red is in House 5.

- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. So, if the person who likes white is in House 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 3.

- The root beer lover does not live in the third house. So, the root beer lover must be in House 1, House 2, House 4, or House 5. But House 1 is already taken by the tea drinker, House 2 is taken by lilies, and House 5 is taken by pizza. So, the root beer lover must be in House 4.

- The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the coffee drinker must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes white
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Grilled cheese, likes yellow
- House 5: Tulips, likes red

The person who likes green lives in House 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We know:
1. The first house has a vase of tulips and ate spaghetti.
2. The second house has a baseball player and a minivan.
3. The third house has a sedan and lilies.
4. The fourth house has a soccer player, a cat lover, and ate fried rice.

From the clues:
- The person who drives a truck is not in the second house.
- The person who drives a minivan is not in the third house.
- The person who owns a sedan is to the left of the person who drives a truck.
- The bird keeper is to the left of the cat lover.
- The fish enthusiast is to the left of the person who had stew.
- The baseball player is directly left of the tennis player.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the soccer player.
- The person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other.
- The person who ate fried rice is to the right of the cat lover.
- The person who has a rose bouquet is to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- The person who ate fried rice is not in the fourth house.
- The person who has a rose bouquet is not in the second house.
- The soccer player is to the right of the baseball player.

Let's place the known items:
- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti
- House 2: Baseball player, Minivan
- House 3: Sedan, Lilies
- House 4: Soccer player, Cat lover, Fried rice

From the clues, we can deduce:
- The minivan and convertible are next to each other, so they must be in houses 2 and 3.
- The sedan is to the left of the truck, so the sedan is in house 3 and the truck is in house 4.
- The lilies are in house 4.
- The fried rice is in house 4.
- The cat lover is in house 4.
- The soccer player is in house 4.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person in these houses has different characteristics:

1. One person likes red and one likes yellow.
2. One person is eating oranges and one is eating grapes.
3. One person reads mystery books and one reads fantasy books.
4. One person drives a truck and one drives a convertible.
5. One person is wearing boots and one is wearing running shoes.

Now, let's use the clues to figure out who lives where:

1. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From clue 3, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then the person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- So, house 1: likes yellow.
- House 2: drives a truck.

From clue 1, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
- So, house 1: likes yellow, eats grapes.

From clue 2, if the person who is wearing boots is in house 1, then the mystery book reader is in house 2.
- So, house 1: likes yellow, eats grapes, wears boots.
- House 2: drives a truck, reads mystery books.

Now, we know:
- House 1: likes yellow, eats grapes, wears boots.
- House 2: drives a truck, reads mystery books.

The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1 because the mystery book reader is in house 2.

So, the correct answer is:
**(B) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to place different characteristics in the houses from 1 to 5. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in house 3.
2. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic, so the science fiction book fanatic is in house 5.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes white is in house 1 or 2.
4. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader is in house 3, and the person who drives a minivan is in house 2.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who drives a truck is in house 4.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the person who had stew, so the person who had stew is in house 5.
7. The person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other, so the person who ate fried rice is in house 2.
8. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue, so the person who likes white is in house 1.
9. The person who drives a minivan and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other, so the person who ate fried rice is in house 2.
10. The person who likes green lives in house 3.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader is in house 3.
12. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who drives a truck is in house 4.
13. The person who had stew is in house 5.
14. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue, so the person who ate spaghetti is in house 5.
15. The person who likes yellow lives in house 5.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: Green, Minivan, Mystery Book Reader
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Stew, Spaghetti, Yellow

The person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D)."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We know:
1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
7. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
8. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
9. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
10. The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

From clue 10, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti

From clue 2, we know:
- House 4: Golfer

From clue 3 and 4, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.

So, the person who had pizza must be in House 3, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.

Since the person who had pizza is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

From clue 6, we know:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.

Since the person who likes white is in House 2, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who likes blue must be in House 4.

From clue 7, we know:
- There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.

Since the person who likes blue is in House 4, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 2, and the person who likes red must be in House 3.

From clue 8, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.

So, the basketball player must be in House 4.

From clue 9, we know:
- The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

Since the person who likes blue is in House 4, the violinist must be in House 3.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist lives in the second house.

These two clues can't both be true for the same person, so we need to figure out who is who. Let's assume the second house is for the violinist. Then the basketball player must be in either the first or third house.

3. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

This means the cricketer can't be in the third house, so the cricketer must be in the first house. The cellist must then be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

The basketball player must be in the third house because the cricketer is in the first house and the cellist is in the third house.

Therefore, the soccer player must be in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The tea drinker lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses and 4 people, each with a different job, pet, drink, and sport. Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.

9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 2 and 11, we know:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. So, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water must be in:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. So, they must be in:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

So, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this like we're solving a fun puzzle!

We have two houses next to each other, and each house has a person living in it. The people have different flowers and play different instruments.

1. One person has a bouquet of daffodils, and the other has carnations.
2. One person is a pianist, and the other is a guitarist.

We know that:
- The pianist lives in the second house.
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live next to each other.

Since the pianist is in the second house, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together! We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person likes a different fruit, drives a different car, and has a different kind of flower in their foyer. Here are the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
2. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
3. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
4. The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
6. There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
8. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Let's fill in what we know:

- House 1: Oranges
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

Now, let's figure out the rest:

- Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.
- The person with tulips must be in House 2 because it's to the left of the person with the convertible.
- The person with carnations must be in House 1 because there is one house between carnations and lilies, and lilies are in House 5.
- The person with the sedan must be in House 5 because it's to the right of the person with carnations.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes blue lives next to the root beer lover.
2. The romance book lover is not in the first house.
3. The root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The soccer player is in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player is in house 2. Since the romance book lover is not in the first house, they must be in house 2. But we already know the soccer player is in house 2, so the romance book lover can't be there. This means the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Now, since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the root beer lover can't be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person who likes a different color, plays a different sport, and has a different bouquet of flowers. Here are the clues:

1. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:

- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:

- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5. 

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this together!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has a person living in it, and each person has different things:

1. The person in house 1 is a violinist.
2. The person with a computer lives in house 1.
3. The person who has a computer is to the left of the bird keeper.

Since the computer is in house 1, and the bird keeper must be to the right of the person with the computer, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

From clue "
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels lives next to the dog owner.
3. The person with a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person with an SUV lives next to the person wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4, since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3, since the person in House 3 owns a sedan, we can place the sedan in House 3.

From clue 2, the person wearing high heels lives next to the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, the only shoes left are running shoes. Since the cat lover, high heels, and boots are already assigned, the running shoes must be in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Kiwis
   - House 3: Blue

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses or the second and third houses.
   - But the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, so the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.
   - So, House 1: Milk
   - House 3: Tea drinker

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Green

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.
   - But the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Apples

So, the person who is eating apples lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff, so the history book buff must live in the third house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television, so the person with a television must live in the second house.
4. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the television and history book buff are already in the second and third houses, the only devices left are a computer and a phone. The computer must be in the second house because it's to the right of the phone.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (with a computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only book type left is science fiction, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
