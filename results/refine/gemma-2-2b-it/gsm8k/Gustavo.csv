"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we need to solve the equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Simplifying the equation, we get 110 = 2x + 30.  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Since the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30', we can calculate the number of gold coins as 40 + 30 = 70.  

**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Dana's speed profile is interesting.  Let's break it down:

* **Running:**  She's four times faster than her walking speed, meaning her running speed is 4 times her walking speed.
* **Skipping:** Her skipping speed is half her running speed, which is 3 miles per hour / 2 = 1.5 miles per hour.

To find her total distance traveled, we need to consider her time spent running and walking. 

* **Running Time:** Dana runs for 2 hours.
* **Walking Time:** Dana walks for 4 hours.

**Calculating Total Distance:**

* **Running Distance:** 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
* **Walking Distance:** 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

**Total Distance:** 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

**Therefore, Dana can travel 24 miles in six hours.**

"Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of television.  Let's break down his viewing time by day:

* **Monday & Tuesday:** 2 hours
* **Wednesday:** 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
* **Thursday:** 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
* **Friday:** 2 hours

To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to consider the total time spent on TV.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Henry baked a total of 110 cookies after dropping 5.  We also know he baked 2 times the amount he baked last year.  

To find out how many cookies he baked last year, we need to figure out how many he baked this year.  

Let's use the following equation:

*  2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Where 'x' represents the number of cookies he baked last year.

Solving for 'x', we get:

* 2x + 10 = 110
* 2x = 100
* x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"The problem asks for the average number of roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice.  To find this, we need to consider the area of each roll-up. 

* **Beatrice's roll-ups:** 2 roll-ups wide * 24 rolls long = 48 square rolls
* **Marcell's roll-ups:** 3 roll-ups wide * 14 rolls long = 42 square rolls

The total area of the roll-ups eaten is 48 square rolls + 42 square rolls = 90 square rolls. 

Since we are looking for the average, we divide the total area by the number of people: 90 square rolls / 2 people = 45 square rolls per person.

"Let's break down this coffee ratio problem.  We know Katy's ratio is 7:13 for sugar to water.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.

*  Let's represent the value of one part of the ratio as 'x'. 
*  We can set up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons

Solving for x:
*  Divide both sides by 7: x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Therefore, Katy used approximately 17.14 parts of the ratio, which means she used approximately 17.14 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break down this salary scenario.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* **Adrien's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was $40,000.
* **Adrien's salary now:**  His salary increased by 40%, so his salary now is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.
* **Lylah's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30.  Solving for Lylah's salary, we get $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).
* **Lylah's salary now:**  Her salary increased by 40% as well, so her salary now is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).
* **Total salary four years later:**  Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The rats are distributed in groups of 6 pieces of straw per rat.  We know that 160 pieces of straw were used in total.  To find the number of rats, we need to figure out how many rats are in the 10 cages of hamsters.  

* **Hamsters:** 10 cages * 5 pieces/cage = 50 pieces of straw
* **Total Straw:** 160 pieces - 50 pieces = 110 pieces of straw used with the rats.
* **Rats:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.
* **Rats per cage:** 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number.  

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"Elaine's Pokemon collection is a fascinating study in growth!  Let's break down her collection journey:

* **Month 1:** She starts with 20 cards and adds 3 times that amount, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She then collects 20 fewer cards than in Month 1, so she adds 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 3:**  She doubles the total from the first two months, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  Then, she adds 200 cards to that total.

**Therefore, Elaine's total Pokemon card collection is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.**

"The problem presents a classic chicken-egg scenario!  Let's break it down:

We know the total number of eggs collected is 42.  We also know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  

To find the number of red chickens, we can use the following equation:

* **Total eggs = (Red eggs per day) * (Number of red chickens) + (White eggs per day) * (Number of white chickens)**

Let's plug in the known values:

* 42 = (3 * Number of red chickens) + (5 * Number of white chickens)

We also know that the number of red chickens is equal to the number of white chickens plus 2.  Let's substitute that into the equation:

* 42 = (3 * (Number of white chickens + 2)) + (5 * Number of white chickens)

Now we can solve for the number of white chickens.  

* 42 = 3 * Number of white chickens + 6 + 5 * Number of white chickens
* 42 = 8 * Number of white chickens + 6
* 36 = 8 * Number of white chickens
* Number of white chickens = 4.5

This result is not possible.  It's impossible to have a fractional number of chickens.  

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"The problem presents a scenario with a logical inconsistency.  Let's break it down:

* **Leak Rate:** The pools are losing water at a constant rate of 4 gallons per minute.
* **Initial Water Levels:**  The problem states the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This implies the initial water levels were different. 
* **Water Loss:**  The problem states the pools have lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

**The Problem:** The problem is inconsistent.  The information provided does not allow us to determine the initial water levels. 


**Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of water in the small pool.**

"The total amount Janeth will pay is $1980.  To calculate the remaining balance, we need to consider the principal amount and the additional interest.

Therefore, the total amount Janeth will pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200.  

The remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so he is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.
* **Average age in three years:**  To calculate the average age in three years, we need to consider the ages of all three individuals in the future.  

The average age in three years will be (63 + 21 + 42) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 years.

The total score for all four students is 251 points.  We can calculate Jojo's score by subtracting the scores of the other three students from the total score: 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104 points.

Therefore, Jojo scored **104** points.

"To determine the number of cherry tomato vines Steve needs, we need to consider his daily consumption and the yield per vine. 

He eats 6 tomatoes per day, and each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.  

To calculate the total tomatoes needed, we multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total tomatoes needed by the yield per vine: 42 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines.

"The problem states that Bill starts on the 3rd floor and then rides the elevator to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  

Let's break it down:

* **Starting Floor:** Bill begins on the 3rd floor.
* **Equation:**  The problem states that the floor Bill reaches is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  This can be written as:  x = 4x + 6
* **Solving for x:**  To find the floor Bill is on, we need to solve the equation.  
    * Subtract 4x from both sides: -3x = 6
    * Divide both sides by -3: x = -2

Therefore, Bill is on the **-2nd** floor.

"The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes. To reach 100% charge, we need to calculate the time required to gain 40% of charge, which is the difference between 100% and the current 60%. 

The phone gains 1% of charge every 3 minutes.  To calculate the time to reach 40% charge, we can use the following formula:

Time = (Charge Needed / Charge Rate) * 3 minutes

Charge Needed = 40% of 100% = 0.40
Charge Rate = 1% per 3 minutes

Time = (0.40 / 0.01) * 3 = 120 minutes

Finally, convert the time from minutes to hours:

Time = 120 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours.

"Job B offers a higher net pay, by a significant margin.  Let's break it down:

* **Job A:**  $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000 gross pay.  
   *  $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.
   *  Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:** $42,000 gross pay.
   *  $42,000 - $6,000 (property tax) = $36,000 net income after property tax.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we need to consider the total number of students and the size of the equal groups. 

Let's represent the number of students in each of the equal groups as 'x'.  The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.  The remaining group has x - 10 students.  

The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

"The farm has a total of 60 animals, and we know that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know that:
* c + w = 60 (total animals)
* c = 2w (twice as many chickens as cows)

To solve for the number of animals, we can use substitution.  Since we know c = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation:

2w + w = 60

Combining like terms: 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
w = 60 / 3 = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):

c = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, let's calculate the total number of legs:

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

"The weight of the container is 20 pounds, and the animals are a pink frog, a blue beetle, a green toad, a yellow snake, and a red bird.  

* **Pink Frog:** 50 pounds
* **Blue Beetle:** 50 pounds
* **Green Toad:** 50 pounds
* **Yellow Snake:** 60 pounds
* **Red Bird:** 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 220 pounds. 

The total weight of the container and the animals is 20 + 220 = 240 pounds.

"Let's break down the cost of Morgan's party and figure out how many friends she can invite!

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person.  
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10. 
* **Total Budget:** Morgan has $90 to spend.

To figure out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the cost of mini-golf and go-karts. 

**Let's use a simple equation:**

* **Total cost = (Cost per person for mini-golf) * (Number of friends) + (Cost per ride for go-karts) * (Number of rides)**

**Let's plug in the numbers:**

* $5 * (Number of friends) + $10 * (Number of rides) = $90

**Now, we need to solve for the number of friends:**

* **To find the number of friends, we need to find the number of rides.  We know that the total cost is $90.  We also know that the cost of mini-golf is $5 per person and the cost of go-karts is $10 per ride.  We can use this information to solve for the number of friends.**

**Let me know if you'd like to try solving for the number of friends!**

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Billy has $10.00 and wants to buy candy.  We need to figure out how many pounds of candy he can buy.

* **Candy Cost:**  The candy costs $1.50 per pound.  We need to figure out how many pounds he can buy with $10.00.
* **Gumballs:**  He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.  We need to figure out how much that costs.

**To find the number of pounds of candy, we can use the following equation:**

"The train's service interval is based on its total mileage traveled.  To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total mileage traveled per day and then divide that by the service interval.

* **Total mileage per day:** The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it makes 3 trips per day, so the total mileage per day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles.
* **Service interval:** The train requires service every 18,000 miles.

**Therefore, the number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.** 

**The train needs service every 27 days.**

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To find the original amount of land he had, we can use a simple proportion.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land.  We know that:

(3/5)x = 12.8 hectares

To solve for x, we can follow these steps:

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3: 
   x = 12.8 * (5/3)

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6.  To find the difference in popsicles, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the value of one ratio part:**  The total number of popsicles is 165, and the ratio parts are 5 + 6 = 11.  Therefore, one ratio part is 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

2. **Determine Betty's popsicles:** Betty has 5 parts in the ratio, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

3. **Determine Sam's popsicles:** Sam has 6 parts in the ratio, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

4. **Calculate the difference:** Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Mel can save a significant amount of energy by reducing his AC usage.  Here's how to calculate the savings:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:**  The AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours a day, so his daily energy consumption is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours.
* **Reduced Usage:**  He reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, so his daily energy consumption is now 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours.
* **Energy Savings:**  The difference in energy consumption is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-hours:**  To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000.  So, the total energy saved in kilowatt-hours is 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

"The average number of stripes across the three zebras is calculated as follows:

* **Total stripes:** 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra + 36 stripes + 18 stripes = 34 stripes + 36 stripes + 18 stripes = 88 stripes
* **Average stripes per zebra:** 88 stripes / 3 zebras = 29.33 stripes/zebra

"Alright, let's break this down.  We need enough meat and cheese for 20 people, and each sandwich needs 1 pound of each.  

* **Meat:** 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.  That means we need 5 pounds of meat.
* **Cheese:**  Same as the meat, we need 5 pounds of cheese.
* **Cost:**  Meat is $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost us $7.00 * 5 = $35.00.  Cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost us $3.00 * 5 = $15.00.  
* **Total:**  The total cost will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Let's break down Elliott's steps:

* **School Commute:**  He walked half his total steps to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
* **Short Walk:** He then took 1,000 steps on his walk with his friend.
* **Remaining Steps:** After his walk with his friend, he had 2,000 steps left.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took on his walk with his friend and the steps he took to and from school from the total steps he had left: 2,000 - 1,000 - 5,000 = -4,000. 

This result doesn't make sense. It means Elliott didn't take any steps during his jog.

"Toby has a 45-page book, and he reads at 300 words per minute.  He needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes.  

To calculate how early he'll arrive, we need to consider the time it takes to read the book.  

* **Time to read the book:** 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words
* **Time to read the book:** 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book.  

**Therefore, Toby will arrive at the airport 30 minutes early.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500
* **Solve for x:** x = 500 - 45 - 60 = 405

"The problem presents a classic case of simultaneous equations.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries using a simple substitution method. 

Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Kenny needs to sell enough cards to cover the $100 amusement park ticket.  We know he's selling each card for $1.50.  Let's figure out how many cards he needs to sell.

* **Earnings:**  To cover the $100 ticket, he needs to earn $100.
* **Selling Price:** Each card sells for $1.50.
* **Number of Cards:**  To find the number of cards, we can use the following equation:

   $100 = $1.50 * x 

* **Solving for x:**  Divide both sides by $1.50: 
   $100 / $1.50 = x
   66.67 = x

* **Rounding:** Since he can't sell fractions of cards, Kenny needs to sell approximately 67 cards.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know George spent $5.00 and had 1% of that remaining.  

* **Chips:**  He bought 3 bags of chips at $0.40 each, totaling $1.20.
* **Remaining Funds:**  He had $5.00 - $0.05 = $4.95 left.
* **Candy Bars:**  He spent $4.95 on candy bars, and each bar costs $0.75.  To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the total spent on candy bars by the price per bar: $4.95 / $0.75 = 6.6. 

Since you can't buy parts of candy bars, George bought **6** candy bars.

"The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees from the oven's operation.  After the window is opened, the temperature decreases by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes.  To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after the oven's heating and the cooling effect of the window. 

The oven's heating effect is 900 degrees.  The cooling effect of the window is 3 degrees per 10 minutes.  To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after the oven's heating and the cooling effect of the window. 

The final temperature is 40 degrees + 900 degrees - 3 degrees = 937 degrees. 

**Final answer: 937**

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Jon's total time is 160 minutes.  We also know James is 10% faster in the swim and takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  

To find James's run time, we need to consider the following:

* **Jon's swim time:** 40 minutes
* **Jon's bike time:** 70 minutes
* **Jon's run time:** 50 minutes
* **Jon's total time:** 160 minutes
* **James's swim time:** 44 minutes (10% faster than Jon's 40 minutes)
* **James's bike time:** 75 minutes (5 minutes longer than Jon's 70 minutes)

To find James's run time, we can use the following equation:

**James's total time = Jon's total time - Jon's win time**

**James's run time = James's total time - Jon's total time**

**James's run time = 119 minutes**

"Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Movie C was 1.25 hours.  To find the length of Movie A, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Convert Movie C to minutes:** Movie C was 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.
* **Find the length of Movie B:** Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B was 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.
* **Find the length of Movie A:** Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A was 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  We need to figure out how many trips the farmer needs to make to get all the feed for his horses. 

* **Sugar cubes:**  He's only buying two boxes, so that's a small amount.
* **Carrots:**  Four bags of carrots is a good amount to keep them fresh.
* **Hay:**  Forty-two bales of hay is a lot, but it's the main food for the horses.
* **Oats:**  Twenty sacks of oats are a good amount to supplement the hay.

Now, we need to figure out how much feed the truck can carry at a time.  It can carry 2250 pounds.

To figure out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we need to divide the total weight of the feed by the weight the truck can carry.

* Total weight: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds
* Trips: 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

**Answer:** The farmer needs to make **2** trips.

"The key here is to understand the cost per guest for each venue.  

Venue 1 has a fixed cost of $200, regardless of the number of guests.  Venue 2 charges $25 per guest.  

To find the point where the costs are equal, we need to find the number of guests that make the two venues have the same cost.

Let's set up an equation:

* **Venue 1 Cost:** $200 + $5 * x = $25 * x 

Where 'x' represents the number of guests.

Solving for 'x':

* $200 = $20 * x
* x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Bodhi's insects:**  We know Bodhi found 'x' insects.
* **David's insects:** David found half of Bodhi's insects, so he found x/2 insects.
* **Lily's insects:** Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7 insects.

To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of insects each person found:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms: 
5x/2 + 7 = 43

Now, let's solve for x:

* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

To find Lily's insects, substitute the value of x back into the equation:

(14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Suzie purchased four packs of gum in total.  Two of these packs were strawberry, and she paid $2 for each pack of grape gum.  The remaining two packs were green apple, and she paid half the price of the grape gum for each pack of green apple gum.  

To find the cost of each strawberry pack, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = cost of grape gum + cost of green apple gum

We know the total cost is $7.  We can solve for the cost of the green apple gum by subtracting the cost of the grape gum from the total cost:

$7 - $2 = $5

We can then solve for the cost of each pack of green apple gum by dividing the total cost of the green apple gum by the number of packs:

$5 / 2 = $2.50

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.50. 


**Answer:** $2.50

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we need to consider the ratio.  Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia did, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4x onions.

We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 12

Solving for x, we get: x = 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, let's find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.  We can use the same ratio to find Sophia's potato count:

*  Rose bought 4 potatoes.
*  Sophia bought 3 onions.

Since Rose bought 4 potatoes, and Sophia bought 3 onions, we can set up a proportion: 4/3 = x/y

Solving for x, we get: x = 4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, Sophia bought 12 potatoes.

**Answer:** 3 onions and 12 potatoes.

"The new device will increase Ada's daily consumption by 2 kW/hour.  To calculate the difference in weekly bills, we need to consider the daily consumption and the cost per kilowatt-hour. 

**Weekly Consumption:**

* Ada's daily consumption is 12 kW/hour.
* The new device adds 2 kW/hour, so her new daily consumption is 14 kW/hour.
* Her weekly consumption is 14 kW/hour * 7 days/week = 98 kW/week.

**Weekly Bill Calculation:**

* Ada's weekly bill before the new device is 98 kW/week * $1.50/kW/hour = $147.00.
* Her weekly bill after the new device is 98 kW/week * $1.50/kW/hour = $147.00.

**Difference:**

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar has a ratio of jelly beans.  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  

* Red jelly beans are 99% of the total, so we can represent that as 0.99b.
* Green jelly beans are 101% of the total, so we can represent that as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 2.99b = 4500.  

Solving for 'b', we find that b = 1500.  

Now, to find the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

The jar has 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago.  We can express this relationship as:

*  Current age = 2 * (Age five years ago)

To find Jerry's age in three years, we need to consider his current age and add three years.

*  Age in three years = Current age + 3

Let's solve for the current age:

*  Age in three years = 2 * (Age five years ago) + 3

We know that Age five years ago is equal to Jerry's current age minus five.  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation:

*  Age in three years = 2 * (Current age - 5) + 3

To find the current age, we can use the equation:

*  Current age = 2 * (Age five years ago)

We know that Age five years ago is equal to Jerry's current age minus five.  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation:

*  Current age = 2 * (Current age - 5)

Solving for Current age:

*  Current age = 2 * Current age - 10
*  Current age + 10 = 2 * Current age
*  10 = Current age

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in three years, we can add three to his current age:

*  Age in three years = 10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in three years.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000 with an additional $500 for a porcelain crown.  His initial deposit is $600.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

* Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
* The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"Based on the tire rotation rate of 725 rotations per 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations for Jeremy's 400 miles.  

* Total rotations for 400 miles: 400 miles * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations.

To determine the number of years before tire replacement, we need to consider the total rotations per year and the number of rotations for Jeremy's driving.

* Total rotations per year: 10,440,000 rotations.
* Total rotations for 400 miles: 290,000 rotations.
* Years to replace tires: 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36.9 years.

He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  He chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second. To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to consider the conversion factor: 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). 

Therefore, her internet speed is 20 kilobits per second * 1000 kilobits per megabit = 20000 kilobits per megabit.

To convert kilobits per megabit to megabits per hour, we need to multiply by 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour. This gives us 20000 kilobits per megabit * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72,000,000 kilobits per hour.

"The price of the crate is determined by the cost of each fruit type.  

* **Apples:**  $0.50 per apple
* **Bananas:** $1.00 per banana (twice the price of an apple)
* **Oranges:** $3.00 per orange (three times the price of a banana)

"Let's analyze the card distribution.  

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    *  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Total cards:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47

* **Calculate Becca's cards:**
    * Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Milly's return will cost her a bit of money, but not a lot.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Shipping:** The shipping cost is calculated by adding the weight of the book and the distance to the shipping company's rate.  The rate is $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds and is being shipped 20 miles, so the shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.
* **Refund:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's original price, which was $32.  This means Milly will receive $24.00 back.
* **Total Loss:**  The total cost Milly will incur is $3.00 for shipping and $24.00 for the refund, for a total of $27.00.  

**Answer:** Milly will lose $27.00.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical pattern.  Let's break it down:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:**  He produces half of week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:**  He produces three times the output of week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:**  To find the output for week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:**  Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"The installation cost for Angela's project is straightforward.  We'll need to factor in the base price of $129.00, plus the cost for the additional items. 

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be $529.00.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  

Let's break it down:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. 
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches. 
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches. 

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we need to consider the relationship between the mountain's height and the lifting capacity. 

**Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches.** 

**Answer:** 40 feet.

"Let's break down this problem.  

The key here is understanding the relationship between speed, distance, and time.  We know that the total distance is constant, and the number of kangaroos and turtles doesn't change that.  

The time it takes for the kangaroos to travel is directly proportional to their speed.  

* **Kangaroos:**  They travel at a speed of 'x' and take 18 hours.
* **Turtles:** They travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is 'x/2'.

To find the time it takes for four turtles, we can use the following:

* **Time = Distance / Speed**

Since the distance is the same for both, we can set up a proportion:

* **Time (Kangaroos) / Time (Turtles) = Distance (Kangaroos) / Distance (Turtles)**

Let's plug in the values we know:

* 18 hours / Time (Turtles) = x / (x/2)

Simplifying the equation:

* 18 hours / Time (Turtles) = 2

Solving for Time (Turtles):

* Time (Turtles) = 18 hours / 2 = 9 hours

**Therefore, it will take four turtles 9 hours to travel the same distance.**

"Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.  

Here's how to calculate that:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + rt) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the relationship between the ages of the three siblings:
    *  The individual's age is represented by the variable 'x'.
    *  The brother's age is 'x + 3'.
    *  The sister's age is 'x - 2'.

* We are given a key piece of information: the sum of their ages equals 87.  This can be expressed mathematically as: 
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

* Simplifying the equation:
   3x + 1 = 87

* Solving for 'x':
   3x = 86
   x = 28

* Therefore, the individual's age is 28.

"To determine the number of books Fawn possesses, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as ""F"".  

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  This translates to the following equations:

* Sofie's books = F + 25
* Anne's books = F - 12

The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation:

3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F:

3F = 72
F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

We know he's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens for $50 each, and he wants to make a profit of $2000.  

Let's break it down:

* **Total chickens sold:** 3/5 * 300 chickens = 180 chickens
* **Total revenue:** 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000
* **Total cost:** $9000 (revenue) - $2000 (profit) = $7000

**Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.**

"Let's break down the problem.  

Sarah's selling rope for $2 per meter.  To find out how much profit she'll make, we need to calculate the total amount she'll earn from selling the rope.  

* **Total Revenue:** 20 meters * $2/meter = $40

To determine how much money she'll have left after buying a new rope, we need to know how many meters of the new rope she'll purchase.  

**Let's say Sarah buys x meters of the new rope.**

* **Cost of New Rope:** $1.50/meter * x meters = $1.50x
* **Money Left:** $40 - $1.50x

**Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope is $40 - $1.50x.**

"The singer has 50 microphones, and we need to arrange them in pairs.  We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit in pairs.  This means that 20% of the microphones are unusable.  

To find the number of pairs that can be arranged, we need to find the number of usable microphones.  We can do this by subtracting the unusable microphones from the total number of microphones. 

The number of usable microphones is 50 microphones - (20% of 50 microphones) = 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones.

We can then divide the usable microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

The number of pairs is 40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

The whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  Therefore, the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.  

The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so the whirligig spins 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second. 

**Answer:** 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago.  This means we can set up an equation:

* Duncan's age eight years ago:  D = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)

We also know Duncan's current age is 60.  Therefore, we can find Duncan's age four years ago:

* Duncan's age four years ago: D - 4 = 60 - 4 = 56

Now, we can substitute this value into our equation:

* 56 = 2 * (Adam's age four years ago)

To find Adam's age four years ago, we can divide both sides by 2:

* 28 = Adam's age four years ago

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his age four years ago:

* Adam's age in 8 years: 28 + 8 = 36

The number of yellow balloons is 58 total bologna - 40 bologna for red balloons = 18 bologna.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We need to find Peter's age.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Peter's age is represented by ""P""
    * Paul's age is ""P + 10"" (he's 10 years older than John)
    * John's age is ""J""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"Fern should definitely go with the Widgeteer 3000.  The WidgetMaster 9000 is simply not efficient enough to justify the higher cost.  Here's why:

* **Production Rate:** The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 produces only 45. This means the Widgeteer 3000 is producing 15 more widgets per hour.
* **Daily Earnings:**  With a 24-hour work day and 30 days, the Widgeteer 3000 will produce 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = $7200.  The WidgetMaster 9000 will produce 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = $32400.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the team scored a total of 45 points.  Bahati scored the most, and his score was 20 more than Azibo's and 10 more than Dinar's.  

To find Azibo's score, we can use the following steps:

1. **Let's represent the scores:**
   * Dinar's score: D
   * Azibo's score: A
   * Bahati's score: B

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * B = A + 20 
   * B = D + 10
   * A + D + B = 45

3. **Substitute to solve for A:**
   * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
     * D + 10 = A + 20
     * A = D - 10

4. **Substitute into the total points equation:**
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

5. **Simplify and solve for D:**
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

6. **Find Azibo's score (A):**
   * A = D - 10
   * A = 11.67 - 10
   * A = 1.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

* **Measuring spoons:** 4/3 dozen = 16 measuring spoons.
* **Total utensils:** 2 dozen cups + 16 measuring spoons = 32 utensils.
* **Pedro's gift:** Jonathan gave 6 measuring spoons to Pedro.
* **Remaining utensils:** 32 - 6 = 26 utensils.

* **Total patients admitted in two weeks:** 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients
* **Total unoccupied beds:** 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 unoccupied beds

**Therefore, the hospital has 300 unoccupied beds after two weeks.**

"Let's break down this Pokemon puzzle.  

We know Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 fewer than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.  

* **Let's represent the Pokemon each person has caught:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **We can set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **To find Stan's catch, we need to solve for 'S'.**  We can do this by substituting the first two equations into the third equation:
    * (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339

* **Now, we can substitute the second equation into this equation:**
    * 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Now that we know W, we can find S:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three legs: a southward flight, a northward flight, and a final southward flight.  

* **Southward Flight:** The bird flies 300 miles south at 30 miles per hour for 10 hours.
* **Northward Flight:** The bird flies 36 miles north at 18 miles per hour for 2 hours.
* **Southward Flight:** The bird flies 110 miles south at 22 miles per hour for 5 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances of each leg. 

**Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles**

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Emil's age:** Emil is currently 19 years old.
* **Age difference:** When Emil turns 24, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old, and his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old. 
* **Age difference:** This means the age difference between Emil and his brother is 12 - 19 = -7 years. 

**Therefore, the sum of their ages is 48 + 12 = 60 years.**

"The flower bed is 111 feet long, which is equal to 1332 inches.  To determine the number of plants Pat can fit, we need to consider the spacing between each plant.  Since each plant is 12 inches wide, we can calculate the total width of the bed in inches.  

To determine the number of plants Pat can fit, we divide the total width of the bed by the width of each plant.  This gives us 1332 inches / 12 inches/plant = 111 plants.  

However, Pat already owns 17 plants.  Therefore, she needs to purchase 111 plants - 17 plants = 94 plants.

The cost of each plant is $6.  Therefore, the total cost of the plants is 94 plants * $6/plant = $564.

"To determine the number of roses they can plant, we need to consider the available soil and the weight of each type of flower. 

* **Roses:** Each rose requires 1 pound of soil.
* **Carnations:** Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
* **Sunflowers:** Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.

We know they have 30 pounds of soil and need to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations. 

**Calculation:**

1. **Carnation weight:** 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
2. **Sunflower weight:** 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
3. **Total weight:** 15 pounds + 12 pounds = 27 pounds
4. **Remaining soil:** 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds
5. **Roses:** 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"Let's break down this problem.  We need to figure out the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.  

* **Understanding the Ratio:**  The key is recognizing that the adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice. This means the adult's slice is represented by 2x, where x is the size of a kid's slice.

* **Total Slices:**  We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are a total of 6 slices.

* **Calculating the Percentage:**  To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to express the adult's slice as a fraction of the total slices.  

**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x/6) * 100% = (x/3) * 100%.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Teresa sells large stuffed animals at three times the price of small ones.  

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

"A steel pickaxe provides a significant boost in ore extraction.  With a steel pickaxe, each dwarf can mine 18 pounds per day, as the additional 50% is a direct increase.  

To calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month, we need to consider the daily output and the number of days in the month. 

* **Daily Output:** 40 dwarves * 18 pounds/dwarf = 720 pounds
* **Monthly Output:** 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine **21,600** pounds of ore in a month.

She then released half of her yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.  Finally, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 6 blue balloons to her collection.  

Therefore, Sally carried 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons into school.

"The probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework is 8%. 

Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%
* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

"It takes Jim 4 years to earn his degree, and he'll be earning $75,000 per year after graduation.  

To figure out how long it will take him to earn the total amount he'll owe in loans and the income he'd have earned if he was working, we need to consider the following:

* **Loan payments:** Jim will pay $50,000 per year for 4 years, totaling $200,000.
* **Lost income:**  He'll be out of the workforce for 4 years, losing $25,000 per year, totaling $100,000.
* **Total to earn:**  He needs to earn $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

To reach this goal, it will take him 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years.

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.  

To find the length of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Betsy's portion time = Donovan's portion time + 18 minutes

Let's represent Donovan's portion time with the variable 'x'.  

* Betsy's portion time = x + 18

We know that the total time for the meal is the sum of both portions:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"It will take Melanie **8** more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.  

Here's how we can figure that out:

* Melanie has saved 120 toothpicks so far.
* She needs 80 more toothpicks to reach her goal.
*  To find out how many more weeks it will take, we divide the remaining toothpicks needed by the toothpicks she saves each week: 80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks.

"Let's break down this fence problem.  

We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Harry has.

* **Let's represent Sam's fencing as 'x' feet.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet.**

The total fencing is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

This means Sam has 20 feet of fencing.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fencing from the total:

* 100 - 80 = 20

**Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing left over.**

To determine the difference in ride time, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each slide.

* **Biggest Slide:** Time = Distance / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

"Let's break down this retirement planning scenario.  

First, we need to understand how much Lauren needs to save.  She wants to save for 20 years, and her annual savings are $60,000.  

To figure out how much she needs to save, we can use the following formula:

**Total Savings = Annual Savings * Number of Years**

Total Savings = $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000

So, Lauren needs to save $1,200,000. 

To figure out how many years she needs to work, we can use the following formula:

**Years to Work = Total Savings / Annual Savings**

Years to Work = $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years

**Answer:** 20 years

"Let's break down this egg-painting problem. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.  Let's represent that number with the variable 'x'.  

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  Since we know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can represent Sarah's eggs with the variable 'y'.  

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs painted:

* 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

Now, let's solve for 'y' (Sarah's eggs):

* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

We can substitute this value of 'y' back into the equation for the total number of eggs:

* 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56

Simplifying the equation:

* 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
* 56 = 56

This tells us that our initial assumptions about the number of eggs painted are correct. 

**Answer:**  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons and boxes:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To express this in pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"Grandma's walking time is a bit tricky to calculate.  Let's break it down:

* **Beach walking:** She covers 2 miles at a speed of 3 miles per day / 2 miles = 1.5 miles per hour.
* **Sidewalk walking:**  She walks 1 mile at twice the speed of the beach, so she covers 1 mile / 1.5 miles per hour = 0.67 hours.

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to consider his consumption pattern.  

* **Phase 1:** Chester consumes 3 eggs per day for 30 days, totaling 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.
* **Phase 2:** He then increases to 5 eggs per day for another 30 days, consuming 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.
* **Total Consumption:**  Chester has consumed a total of 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.
* **Dozens Needed:**  To find the number of dozens, we divide the total eggs by the number of eggs per dozen: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

"The avocado tree's fruit production follows a clear pattern.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree produces 50 fruits per year for five years, totaling 250 fruits.
* **Year 6:**  The tree produces 3 times the initial production, so it yields 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:**  The tree produces 7 times the initial production, resulting in 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:**  The tree produces 150 fruits, which is 200 less than the production of a 10-year-old tree.
* **Year 9:**  The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:**  The tree produces 1000 fruits, which is 20 times the initial production.

To calculate the total fruit production, we need to sum the production for each year: 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = **2250 fruits**.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this mathematically as:

*  Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  This can be represented as:

* Blue rope length = Yellow rope length - 7

We can now express the total length of the three ropes as:

* Yellow rope length + Blue rope length + Red rope length = 37

Substituting the expressions for the lengths of the ropes, we get:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 35 = 37

Solving for x:

* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Therefore, the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use the expression:

* Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

Substituting the value of the blue rope length:

* Red rope length = 4 * (12 - 7) 
* Red rope length = 4 * 5
* Red rope length = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"The mural is divided into three equal sections, each representing red, white, and purple paint.  Since half the mural is yellow, we know that the yellow section represents 1/2 of the total.  The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.  

To find the amount of red paint, we can use the following equation:

* **Total paint = (Red + White + Purple) * 3**
* **12 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 3**
* **12 pints / 3 = (Red + White + Purple)**
* **4 pints = (Red + White + Purple)**

Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can simplify the equation:

* **4 pints = (Red + White + Purple)**
* **4 pints = (Red + White + Purple)**
* **4 pints = (Red + White + Purple)**

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 4 pints.

"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs, we need to consider the number of slices she consumes from each type. 

* **Cheese Pizza:** Kate eats 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese pizza slices.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** Kate eats 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni pizza slices.

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day (twice the low setting)
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day (twice the medium setting)

To calculate the total water removal, we need to consider the time spent on each setting:

"The jelly bean jar is a rectangular prism, so we can calculate its volume directly.  The volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height.  The dimensions are 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches.  

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

To calculate the volume of the jelly beans, we need to consider the packing efficiency.  The packing efficiency is the ratio of the volume of the jelly beans to the volume of the jar.  

The packing efficiency is 0.80, so the volume of the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

To determine the number of jelly beans, we divide the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.  The volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.

The number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

The difference between the estimated number of jelly beans and the actual number is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

"Let's analyze the problem.  We know Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class.  We need to figure out how many cupcakes she made.

Let's use the following variables:

*  'c' represents the number of cupcakes.
*  'b' represents the number of brownies.

We know that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by the following equation:

*  b = 3c - 2

We also know that the total number of treats for the class is 10.  Since each person gets 2 treats, we can set up the following equation:

* 2c + 2b = 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

* 2c + 2(3c - 2) = 10

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 6c - 4 = 10
* 8c - 4 = 10
* 8c = 14
* c = 1.75

Since we can't have half a cupcake, we need to re-evaluate our approach.  The problem is not well-defined.

Where 'x' represents the number of novels Regina wrote this year.

Solving for 'x':

* Multiply both sides by 4/3:  x = 9 * (4/3)
* Simplify: x = 12 novels

Therefore, Regina wrote **12** novels this year.

"The custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days, which is a significant workload.  Each classroom requires 15 minutes of cleaning time.  

To determine the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we need to consider the total cleaning time and the total work hours. 

* **Total cleaning time:** 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes
* **Total work hours:** 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes

The custodian spends 1200 minutes / 480 minutes = 2.5 hours cleaning classrooms. 

To express this as a percentage, we can calculate:

* **Percentage of time spent cleaning:** (2.5 hours / 8 hours) * 100% = 31.25%

**Therefore, the custodian spends 31.25% of their day cleaning classrooms.**

"The problem presents a scenario where Rose's initial investment in eggs is not profitable.  

Here's why:

* **Cost Analysis:**  Rose purchased 60 eggs at $2.40 per dozen, totaling $144. This represents a significant initial investment.
* **Selling Strategy:**  She aims to sell each dozen for $1, which is a price that doesn't cover the cost of the eggs. 
* **Profit Calculation:**  To determine profit, we need to consider the difference between the revenue generated and the cost incurred.  However, the revenue generated by selling 48 dozen eggs at $1 per dozen is $48.  This is insufficient to cover the $144 cost.

**Therefore, Rose will experience a loss of $96.**

"The problem states that Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  We know the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We also know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  Let's solve for the number of strawberry cubes.

* Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4: 5x - 4
* Total ice cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for x:

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can substitute the value of x back into the expression for blueberry cubes:

* Blueberry cubes: 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

* **Third Stage:** Four times the initial rate, resulting in 60 * 4 = 240 kernels in the next 30 seconds.
* **Final Stage:**  Half the rate of the previous stage, so 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds.
* **Residual Heat:**  A quarter of the kernels from the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat, meaning 120 / 4 = 30 kernels pop from the residual heat.

**Total:** 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 440 kernels. 

**Therefore, Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.**

Therefore, we can represent the number of blue and yellow blocks as 4x and 2x respectively.  The total number of blocks is 32.  We can then set up an equation to solve for the number of red blocks: 4x + 2x + x = 32.  Simplifying the equation, we get 7x = 32.  Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 4.  Therefore, there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  The total number of blocks is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

Emma's age = x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

* **Allowance:** Ryan earns $6 per week for chores, and he completed 3 weeks worth of chores, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.
* **Ice Cream:**  He spent $1.25 per ice cream cone and bought it for 3 friends, so the total cost is $1.25 * 3 = $3.75.
* **Movie Tickets:**  Tickets cost $6.50 each, and he has $21.75 in total after chores and ice cream, so he can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.33 tickets.

"Igor gathered 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and a total of 29 items.  He lost a number of beakers, and we need to determine the number of beakers lost. 

Let's break down the information:

* **Test tubes:** Igor gathered 8 test tubes, which is half the number requested.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes, which is 2 more than the number requested.
* **Total items:** The total number of items Igor placed on the bench is 29.

To find the number of beakers lost, we can use the following equation:

Total items = Test tubes + Petri dishes + Beakers

We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.  We can solve for the number of beakers:

29 = 8 + 16 + Beakers

29 = 24 + Beakers

Beakers = 29 - 24

Beakers = 5

**Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"Let's break down this farm problem.  We know the total number of animals is 20, and they have a total of 70 legs.  

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

* **c + w = 20**  (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for 'c', we can use a method called substitution.  

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
