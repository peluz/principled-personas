"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen.  

Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"To determine the number of wins, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let 'x' represent the number of games lost.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of wins as 'x + 8'.  The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses, so we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Solving for 'x', we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we find 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, we arrive at x = 7.  Therefore, the team won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's.  This means Gerald's original time is represented by 'x' seconds.  Lee's time is then 'x + 2' seconds.

We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

Now, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his diet change.  We know that his time improved by 10%.  This means his new time is 1.1 times his original time.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later.  

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.  
* We can calculate his salary now by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

To find Lylah's salary, we need to consider the relationship between their salaries.  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

* Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30

We can solve for Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30:

* Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later:

* Lylah's salary now = $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

* Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The hive's population dynamics are fascinating!  Let's break down the bee population:

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is a critical factor in the hive's success.  
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are the industrious workforce, responsible for tasks like foraging and hive maintenance.  
* **Baby Bees:**  Baby bees (b) are the future generation, crucial for the hive's growth.

We know the following:

* **w = 2b**  This means the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees.
* **b = 2q**  This tells us the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

To find the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2 * (2q) = 4q**

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700.  Let's substitute the value of q:

**w = 4 * 100 = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is represented by 'S' and Brooke's age is represented by 'B'.
* We are given that S = 2B, meaning Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* The sum of their ages in two years will be 28.

To find Seth's age, we can use the following equation:

S + B + 2 = 28

Substituting S = 2B into the equation:

2B + B + 2 = 28

Combining like terms:

3B + 2 = 28

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

3B = 26

Dividing both sides by 3:

B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now, we can find Seth's age:

S = 2B = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 63 seconds
* Runner 3: 66 seconds
* Runner 4: 69 seconds

Total time: 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* Runner 1: 55 seconds
* Runner 2: 55 seconds
* Runner 3: 55 seconds
* Runner 4: 55 seconds

Total time: 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used with the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:**  The 10 hamster cages require a total of 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rats:** The remaining 160 pieces of straw are distributed among the rats. 
* **Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used by the straw per rat: 160 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 26.67 rats. 
* **Rat per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 26.67 rats / 3 cages = 8.89 rats/cage. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 9 rats in each cage.**

"The trader's profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of the wheat from the total revenue generated from selling the wheat.  

* **Total cost:**  The cost of the wheat is determined by the purchase price per bag ($20) multiplied by the number of bags purchased (x). 
* **Total revenue:** The revenue is calculated by multiplying the selling price per bag ($30) by the number of bags sold (x).

The profit is calculated as:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

To determine the number of bags sold, we can set up an equation:

Profit = 30x - (20x + 2x)

Solving for x, we get:

400 = 8x
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold **50** bags.

Next, we need to calculate her earnings from lawn mowing. She earns $4 per lawn mowing session.  To find out how many sessions she needs to complete, we divide the total amount she needs to earn by her earnings per session: $70 (total cost) / $24 (earnings per session) = 2.92 sessions. 

Since Sara can't mow a fraction of a lawn, she needs to mow the lawn **3 times** to afford the jacket and shoes.

"The provided problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to model a real-world situation.  Let's break down the problem and apply a systematic approach to find the solution.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We are given that Jerry has a flock of chickens, and we need to determine the number of red chickens.  The problem provides us with the following information:

* **Egg Production:** Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
* **Total Eggs Collected:** Jerry collects 42 eggs each day.
* **Chicken Ratio:** There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

**Solving the Problem:**

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'.

* **Equation 1:**  3r + 5w = 42 (Total eggs produced)
* **Equation 2:** r = w + 2 (Number of white chickens is two more than red chickens)

**Solving for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

1. **Substitute:**  Since we know 'r' is equal to 'w + 2', we can substitute this into Equation 1:
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

2. **Simplify and Solve:**
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5

3. **Check for Validity:**  We cannot have half a chicken. This indicates that there is an error in the problem statement. 

**Conclusion:**

The provided problem has an inconsistency.  It is not possible to have a real-world scenario where the number of chickens and eggs produced can be represented by the given information.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the impact of age progression. 

* **Harriet's Age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's Age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's Age:**  Zack is half of Harriet's age, making him 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

**Calculating the Average Age in Three Years:**

To calculate the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Harriet's Age in Three Years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Adrian's Age in Three Years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Zack's Age in Three Years:** Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old.

**Average Age:**  The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5 years.

**Therefore, the average age of the three in three years is 34.5 years.**

"To determine the total time, we need to consider the time required for each type of hole and then sum the times. 

* **Small holes:**  Each small hole takes 3 minutes.  We need to dig 30 of them, so the total time for small holes is 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
* **Large holes:** Each large hole takes 10 minutes. We need to dig 15 of them, so the total time for large holes is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we add the time for both types of holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"Sam is currently 6 years old. This can be determined by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let R represent Ruby's current age and S represent Sam's current age. We know:

* R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Solving for S in the second equation:

* R + 9 = 3S + 27
* R = 3S + 18 
* Substituting R from the first equation: 6S = 3S + 18
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to understand the relationship between cobras and mambas.  

* **Spot Ratio:**  A cobra has twice the number of spots as a mamba. 

* **Total Spots:**  We know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.  

* **Calculation:**  To find the total number of spots, we can use the following formula:

   Total Spots = (Number of Cobras * Spots per Cobra) + (Number of Mambas * Spots per Mamba)

   Total Spots = (40 * 70) + (60 * 35)

   Total Spots = 2800 + 2100

   Total Spots = 4900

* **Half the Total Spots:**  Half of the total spots is:

   Half of Total Spots = 4900 / 2 = 2450

"The car in the fast lane traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.  To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can use the relationship between distance, speed, and time:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane is 480 miles.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast lane, which is 30 miles per hour.  

Therefore, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane using the following equation:

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use a strategic approach.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Total Players:** The team has 105 members in total.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, meaning the offense has 2 * x players.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning the special teams have x/2 players.

We can express this mathematically as:

x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams) = 105

Combining like terms:

(7/2)x + x = 105

Simplifying:

(9/2)x = 105

Solving for x:

x = 105 * (2/9) = 25

Therefore, there are **25** players on the defense.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in record trading.  Let's break it down:

* **Record Exchange Ratio:** The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means for every 2 old records traded, 1 new record is obtained.

* **Total Records Traded:**  The 5 individuals traded a total of 5 * x records, where 'x' represents the number of old records each person brought in.

* **New Records:** The 7 new records represent the total number of new records obtained from the trades.

* **Solving for x:** We can express the total number of new records as 5x.  We know that 5x = 7.  Solving for x, we get x = 7/5 = 1.4. 

**However, this result is not possible in a real-world scenario.**  The ratio of old records to new records is fixed at 2:1.  Therefore, the number of old records traded cannot be 1.4.

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate.  Let's analyze the two options:

**Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Tax:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**

* **Net Income After Property Tax:** $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* **Tax:** $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
* **Net Pay:** $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x':** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = 60.**

"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased, we need to consider the relationship between the cost of candy and the amount of change he received. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Candy Cost:**  We know Billy spent $0.20 on gumballs, and this represents a portion of his change.  
* **Change Calculation:**  We can calculate the amount of change Billy received by subtracting the cost of the gumballs from his initial amount. 
* **Candy Calculation:**  We can then use the change to determine the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased.

Let's use a simple equation to represent this:

* **Change = Initial Amount - Cost of Gumballs**
* **Change = $9.80 - $0.20**
* **Change = $9.60**

Now, we can use the change to determine the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased. 

* **Candy Cost = Change / Price per Pound**
* **Candy Cost = $9.60 / $1.50 per pound**
* **Candy Cost = 6.4 pounds**


**Therefore, Billy purchased approximately 6.4 pounds of candy.**

"The train's operational requirements are straightforward.  To determine the service interval, we need to consider the total distance traveled per day.  

The train covers a distance of 225 miles per trip.  Since it makes three trips per day, the total distance traveled daily is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips = 675 miles.

The service interval is set at 18,000 miles.  To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train requires service every **27 days**. 


"
"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, we need 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, the total stuffing needed is 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"The trip to the friend's house took approximately 6.00 hours. 

**Explanation:**

* **Outbound Trip:**  The initial leg of the journey to the friend's house is 200 miles at a speed of 70 mph.  This translates to a travel time of 2.86 hours.
* **Detour:** A 10-mile detour adds a small amount of time to the trip.  The detour's impact on the overall travel time is negligible.
* **Return Trip:** The return journey to home is 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. This takes approximately 3 hours. 

Therefore, the total travel time is 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a 11-part ratio.  To determine the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we can calculate the difference in popsicles based on the ratio. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one ratio part by dividing the total popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts of the ratio, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.  Sam has 6 parts of the ratio, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

The difference in popsicles between Sam and Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

"The question presents a classic probability problem.  We need to determine the number of candles that are both defective and explode. 

The key is understanding that the two events are not mutually exclusive.  A candle that is defective is more likely to explode.  

To solve this, we can use the concept of conditional probability.  

Let's break it down:

* **Event A:** A candle is defective.
* **Event B:** A candle explodes.

We know:

* P(A) = 5% = 0.05 (Probability of a candle being defective)
* P(B|A) = 1 (Probability of an exploding candle given it is defective)

We want to find the probability of both events happening: P(A and B).

We can use the following formula:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

P(A and B) = 0.05 * 1 = 0.05

Therefore, 5% of the defective candles will explode.

* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples.

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"The farmer will need to make two trips to transport all the feed.  

Here's why:

* **Hay:** The farmer needs 42 bales of hay, which weigh 75 pounds each, totaling 3150 pounds.
* **Oats:** The farmer needs 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, totaling 1300 pounds.
* **Sugar Cubes:** The farmer buys two boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, totaling 2 pounds.

"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to satisfy his cookie craving, we can set up a simple equation.  

Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt consumes.  The problem states that Matt receives half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.  This translates to the following equation:

0.5x + 2 = 5

Solving for 'x', we can isolate the variable:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
2. Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

Therefore, Matt must consume **6** carrot sticks to satisfy his cookie desire.

"The problem presents a classic example of a proportion.  We know that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers, and 20 students do not.  This means that 1/4 of the students have desktop computers.  

To find the total number of students, we can set up a proportion:

*  (3/4) * x = 1/4 * (total students)

Solving for x, we get:

*  x = (1/4) * (total students) * (4/3)
*  x = (1/3) * (total students)

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.  This means that 1/4 of the students have desktop computers.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

*  (1/4) * (total students) = 20

Solving for the total number of students, we get:

*  (total students) = 20 * 4
*  (total students) = 80

**Answer:** There are 80 students at that grade level.

"To determine the optimal guest count for cost equivalence between the two venues, we need to analyze the cost structure for each option. 

Let's break down the cost components:

* **Venue 1:**  A fixed fee of $200 is incurred regardless of the number of guests.  
* **Venue 2:**  A per-guest cost of $25 is charged, with food already included.

To find the point of cost equality, we need to find the number of guests where the total cost of each venue is equal.

**Setting up the equation:**

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 + $5x 
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25x

**Equating the costs:**

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solving for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are required for the two venues to have the same total cost.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we can break down the problem using a system of equations.  Let's represent Bodhi's insects as 'x'.  

* David found half of Bodhi's insects, which is x/2.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7.

The total number of insects is the sum of these three: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43.

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43.

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have: 5x/2 = 36.

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 5x = 72.

Finally, dividing both sides by 5, we find: x = 14.4.

To find Lily's insects, we substitute the value of x back into the equation (x/2) + 7: (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2.

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

* Twice the rug's width is 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet.
* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, so the couch is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet long.

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"To determine the nephew's age, we can use a simple linear equation.  

Let 'x' represent the nephew's current age.  In seven years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This is because Shiloh's age in seven years will be three times the nephew's age in seven years.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3(x + 7) = 51

Solving for x:

1. 3x + 21 = 51
2. 3x = 30
3. x = 10

Therefore, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the jelly bean types.  Let's break it down:

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can express this as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can express this as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three types:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains **15** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago, and we can model this relationship using a linear equation.  

Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'.  Five years ago, he was 'x-5' years old.  We know that Jerry's current age is twice his age five years ago.  This translates to the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2x - 10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"The angles in a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Ariadne's sales data reveals a clear pattern.  Her green hat sales are a crucial component of her overall revenue.  

To determine her total earnings over two months, we can break down the information:

* **Month 1:**  Ariadne's red hat sales were $400, and her green hat sales were half that amount, totaling $200. This indicates a strong reliance on green hats for her revenue.
* **Month 2:** Her sales in the second month were 3/4 of her earnings in the first month, suggesting a consistent growth pattern.

Therefore, we can calculate her total earnings for the two months as follows:

* **Month 1:** $400 (red) + $200 (green) = $600
* **Month 2:** (3/4) * $600 = $450
* **Total:** $600 (month 1) + $450 (month 2) = $1050

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This can be expressed as s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplifying and solving for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Finally, substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g to find 's': s = 20 - 5 => s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

The key is understanding the proportionality.  For every 6 potatoes, we can produce 36 hash browns.  

To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6x = 36 * 96

* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the optimal oil quantity for Tanya's salt scrub.

**Understanding the Ratios:**

* **Zest and Fragrance:** Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, meaning they are equal.
* **Salt and Zest:**  Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest.
* **Oil and Salt:** Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.

**Solving for the Variables:**

To find the amount of oil, we need to understand the relationship between the quantities of salt, zest, and oil.  

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know she uses 10 ounces of the mixture.

* **Solve for the amount of oil (o):**
    *  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    *  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x 
    *  We know x = zest, so o = 4z

* **Find the amount of oil (o):**
    *  We know that Tanya uses 10 ounces of the mixture. 
    *  We know that the mixture is made up of salt, oil, zest, fragrance, and sugar. 
    *  We can use the information above to find the amount of oil (o).

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to analyze the relationship between the number of cards each individual possesses.  

Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.  Smendrick has 3 times this amount, so he has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards across all three individuals is 341.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Cameron would save 460 pesos. 

Here's why:

* **Cost Analysis:**  The hotel offers two pricing options: a standard 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos and a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos. 
* **Calculating Savings:**  Since Cameron stays for 12 hours, he would have saved 1600 pesos - 1000 pesos = 600 pesos by opting for the 12-hour stay. 
* **Additional Costs:**  He would then pay an additional 70 pesos for each hour after the 12-hour mark, totaling 70 pesos * 2 hours = 140 pesos. 
* **Final Savings:**  Therefore, Cameron would save 600 pesos - 140 pesos = 460 pesos.

"Deanna is 26 years old.  Marcus is half of Leo's age, and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna.  Therefore, Marcus is 21 years old.  To find Leo's age, we can use the following equation:

Marcus's age = Leo's age / 2
Marcus's age - 5 = Leo's age

Solving for Leo's age, we get:

Leo's age = (Marcus's age + 5) * 2

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations based on the given information.  

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A = B - 20
* A = (D + 10) - 20
* A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 10) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D = 45
* D = 15

Now, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = 15 - 10
* A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in cooperative game theory.  We can solve this by considering the distribution of chips.  

* **Let's denote the number of chips each of the three individuals receives as:**
    *  *x* = the number of chips received by the first two individuals
    *  *y* = the number of chips received by the third individual

* **We know that:**
    * *x* + *y* = 140 (the total number of chips received by Amora and Lainey)
    * *x* = *y* + 15 (the third individual receives 15 more chips than the first two)

* **Solving for *x* and *y*:**
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: *y* + 15 + *y* = 140
    * Combine like terms: 2*y* + 15 = 140
    * Subtract 15 from both sides: 2*y* = 125
    * Divide both sides by 2: *y* = 62.5
    * Substitute the value of *y* back into the equation *x* = *y* + 15: *x* = 62.5 + 15 = 77.5

* **Therefore, the total number of chips is:**
    * *x* + *y* + *z* = 77.5 + 62.5 + 125 = 265

"Let's analyze the Pokemon situation.  We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a combined total of 339 Pokemon.  We can represent this information with a system of equations.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * A = Alex's Pokemon count
    * S = Stan's Pokemon count
    * W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon count

* **Formulate the equations:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour, while Trey can run 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half the number of laps that Trey runs, which is 7.  Quinn runs 5 laps less than Shaelyn, meaning he runs 2 laps less than Shaelyn.  To determine the difference between Bethany and Quinn's lap count, we can subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps.  

Therefore, Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Let's break down the power bank's charge depletion:

* **Initial Charge:**  We can assume the power bank started with a full charge of 100%.
* **First 5 Hours:** The power bank lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours, leaving 55% remaining.
* **Next 3 Hours:**  The power bank then lost 21% of its remaining charge in the next 3 hours, leaving 34% after this period.
* **Final Charge:**  The power bank now has 28% of its charge remaining.

To determine the initial charge, we can use the concept of exponential decay.  The power bank's charge loss is a function of time.  We can use the following equation to model this:

* **Charge Remaining = Initial Charge * (1 - Rate of Charge Loss)^Time**

We can use this equation to solve for the initial charge. 

**Answer:** 75%

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the required down payment savings. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

* Hourly wage: $10
* Hourly tips: $15
* Total weekly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we can determine her weekly savings:

* Total weekly earnings: $25
* Savings per week: $25 * 0.20 = $5

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks to reach her savings goal:

* Total savings needed: $10000
* Weekly savings: $5
* Number of weeks: $10000 / $5 = 2000 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for **2000** weeks to save the down payment.

"The price of carrots will increase by a cumulative percentage each year.  Therefore, to calculate the price after three years, we need to consider the price increase for each year. 

* **Year 1:** The price increases by 5% of the original price, so the price after one year is $120 * 1.05 = $126.
* **Year 2:** The price increases by 5% of the price from year 1, so the price after two years is $126 * 1.05 = $133.70.
* **Year 3:** The price increases by 5% of the price from year 2, so the price after three years is $133.70 * 1.05 = $139.76.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is **$139.76**.

"The hotel began with 100 guests.  24 guests checked out early and 15 guests checked out late.  In the afternoon, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, resulting in 30 guests.  Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner.  

To calculate the current number of guests, we need to consider the initial number of guests, the number of early checkouts, the number of late checkouts, and the number of guests who checked in after dinner.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Marcus faces a 20% chance of not needing to complete his homework. This is due to a 50% chance of a substitute teacher and a 40% chance of an extension from the regular teacher.  

The probability of needing to complete his homework is 100% - 20% = 80%. 

The probability of needing to complete his homework is further influenced by the possibility of an extension.  The probability of needing to complete his homework and receiving an extension is 20% * 40% = 8%. 

Therefore, the probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework is 8%.

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the net increase in his earnings. 

* **Income increase:**  His degree increases his annual income by $75,000, a significant jump from his previous $25,000.
* **Total income during college:** Over four years, he earns $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.
* **Total loan payments:** He pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000 in loans.
* **Total lost income:**  He loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Net income gain:**  His net income gain is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year.

To calculate the time to recoup his losses, we need to determine how many years it takes to earn $300,000. 

**Time to recoup:**  $300,000 / $50,000 = 6 years.

"To determine the fabric requirements for Jim's comforter, we need to consider the dimensions of the bed and the desired dimensions of the fabric.  

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To ensure a proper fit, we need to add 2 feet to each dimension for the fabric pieces. This means the fabric pieces will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

The area of the bed is calculated as 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

Each fabric piece will have an area of 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim will need a total of 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  To calculate the value in 2010, we need to consider the depreciation rate and the initial value.  

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.  

The value of the car in 2010 is calculated as follows:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"Let's analyze the time allocation for this culinary collaboration.  

We know that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  This means we can represent Donovan's portion as 'x' minutes. Betsy's portion, therefore, took 'x + 18' minutes.  

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.  We can express this mathematically as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

2x = 80
x = 40

"To determine the amount of fence remaining for Sam, we need to first determine the total length of fence allocated to Harry.  

Let's represent Sam's fence length as 'x' and Harry's as 'x + 60'.  The total fence length is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find the amount left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence length from the total fence length:

100 - 80 = 20

"Lauren's retirement plan is a solid one!  To determine how many more years she needs to work, we need to consider her annual savings and living expenses.  

First, let's calculate her annual savings: 20% of her $100,000 salary is $20,000.  

Next, we need to determine her annual living expenses.  She plans to live on 40% of her salary, which is $40,000.

To calculate her annual savings after living expenses, we subtract her living expenses from her salary: $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000.

Now, we need to figure out how much she needs to save over the next 20 years.  She needs to save $1,200,000.

Finally, we can calculate how many years she needs to work to reach her savings goal.  $1,200,000 / $60,000 per year = 20 years.

"The fastest car ever recorded is a testament to automotive engineering prowess.  To determine its top speed, we need to consider the relative performance of different vehicles. 

The 2nd fastest car, in comparison to the average car, is a significant factor.  The average car's speed is 120 mph.  The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, meaning it achieves a speed of 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph.

To find the speed of the fastest car, we need to consider the relative speed difference. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, which is 600 mph.  Therefore, the fastest car achieves a speed of 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph.

"Let's break down the problem using a strategic approach. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  This means we can represent their individual contributions as 'x' and 'x' respectively.  

Next, we need to consider the relationship between Camden and Sarah. We know they painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  This can be represented as 'y' and 'y + 12' respectively.

To find the number of eggs each person painted, we can use the following equation:

*  x + x = 2x 
*  y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12

Solving for 'y' in the second equation, we get:

*  y = 22 - x

Now, we can substitute this value of 'y' back into the first equation:

*  x + x = 2x
*  2x = 56

Solving for 'x', we find:

*  x = 28

This means Arnold and Madeline painted 28 eggs each.

To find the number of eggs Camden painted, we can substitute the value of 'x' back into the equation for 'y':

*  y = 22 - x
*  y = 22 - 28

"The avocado tree's fruit production follows a clear pattern:

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree exhibits a consistent growth rate, producing 50 fruits per year.
* **Year 6-8:**  The production increases exponentially, with each year's yield being three times the previous year's.
* **Year 9:**  The tree experiences a significant decline in production, producing zero fruits.
* **Year 10:**  The tree reaches its peak production, yielding 20 times the initial production.

To calculate the total fruit production, we can break down the production for each year and sum the results:

* **Year 1-5:** 50 fruits/year * 5 years = 250 fruits
* **Year 6-8:** 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits/year * 3 years = 450 fruits
* **Year 9:** 0 fruits
* **Year 10:** 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits

**Total fruit production:** 250 + 450 + 0 + 1000 = **1700 fruits**

"The problem presents a classic linear equation scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
    *  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(y - 7)' cm long.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm, so:
    y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve the equation:**
    1. y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    2. 6y - 35 = 37
    3. 6y = 72
    4. y = 12

* **Determine the length of the red rope:**
    The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 cm.

"The mural's color distribution is a classic geometric problem.  We know the yellow paint represents half the mural, and the red, white, and purple paints are equal.  Therefore, we can calculate the amount of each color by dividing the total paint by the number of colors.  

* **Yellow:** 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints
* **Red, White, and Purple:** 12 pints / 4 = 3 pints per color.

To find the amount of red paint, we can use the information about the yellow paint.  Since the yellow paint represents half the mural, and the red, white, and purple paints are equal, we can deduce that the red paint represents 6 pints * 3 pints/color = 18 pints.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to consider the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes.  Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'.

We know that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by the equation:

* b = 3c - 2

This equation tells us that the number of brownies is three times the number of cupcakes minus 2.

To find the number of cupcakes, we can use the total number of treats the class received:

* 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats

We can then set up an equation to represent the total number of treats:

* b + c = 10

Now, substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between strawberry and blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5 times 'x' minus 4.  

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Solving for 'x', we get: 6x - 4 = 116.  
Adding 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 6: x = 20.

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

"The boat's value depreciates linearly, with each year's depreciation being 30% of the previous year's value.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation, leaving $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation, leaving $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation, leaving $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"To determine the number of pink candies, we first need to calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies.  

* Red candies: 54
* Orange candies: 54 * 2 = 108

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

2x + 16 = 96

2x = 80

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase, we need to consider his total funds after completing his chores and purchasing the ice cream. 

First, we know Ryan earns $18 from his chores.  Then, he spends $3.75 on ice cream for himself and three friends.  This leaves him with $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

Next, we need to figure out how many movie tickets he can buy with his remaining funds.  Tickets cost $6.50 each, so we can divide his remaining funds by the ticket price: $14.25 / $6.50/ticket = 2.2 tickets.

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can purchase **2** movie tickets.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20**  (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
