"Wendi needs to give her chickens 40 cups of feed in the final meal. 

Here's how we know:

* She gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups.

"Jill works a lot! She teaches for 35 hours a week and coaches for 15 hours a week.  That's a lot of work! 

To find out how much she makes, we need to figure out how much she makes each week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

* **Teacher pay:** Jill makes $20 per hour teaching, and she works 35 hours a week. So, she makes $20 * 35 = $700 each week.
* **Coach pay:** Jill makes $30 per hour coaching and works 15 hours a week. So, she makes $30 * 15 = $450 each week.
* **Total pay:**  Jill makes $700 + $450 = $1150 each week.
* **Yearly pay:**  Jill works 52 weeks a year, so she makes $1150 * 52 = $60,200 a year.

"Gunter's friends are guessing how many jelly beans are in the jar.  

*  One friend says 80 jelly beans.
*  Another friend says 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
*  The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.

To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and then divide by the number of guesses.

*  First friend's guess: 80
*  Second friend's guess: 80 + 20 = 100
*  Third friend's guess: 80 + 20 = 100

Now, let's add all the guesses together: 80 + 100 + 100 = 280

Finally, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 280 / 3 = 93.33

The average guess is 93.33.

"Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds from his bag.  He has comic books that weigh 1/4 of a pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 of a pound each.  He takes out 30 comic books.  To find out how many toys he needs to take out, we need to figure out how much weight the toys make up.  

First, we find out how much the comic books weigh: 30 comic books * (1/4 pound/comic book) = 7.5 pounds. 

Then, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to take out: 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.

Now, we need to figure out how many toys he needs to take out to make up the 7.5 pounds.  Since each toy weighs 1/2 a pound, he needs to take out 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 toys. 


**Answer:** 15 toys

Here's how:

* **Unripe oranges:** 20% of 25 oranges = 5 unripe oranges
* **Bad and sour oranges:** 1 bad orange + 2 sour oranges = 3 bad or sour oranges
* **Good oranges:** 25 total oranges - 5 unripe oranges - 3 bad or sour oranges = 17 good oranges

"Cecilia needs to feed her puppy a lot of food!  

First, she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of food every day for 180 days. That's like feeding it for 6 months! Then, she needs to feed it 2 cups of food every day for the rest of its life. 

To figure out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to know how many days the puppy lives.  Let's say the puppy lives for a whole year. 

If the puppy lives for a year, she'll need 2 cups of food every day for 365 days. 

To find out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to know how many cups of food she'll need in total. 

She'll need 180 cups of food for the first 180 days. Then, she'll need 730 cups of food for the rest of the puppy's life. 

So, she'll need 180 + 730 = 910 cups of food. 

To find out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to divide the total cups of food by the number of cups in each bag. 

910 cups / 110 cups per bag = 8 bags of food. 


**Answer:** 8 bags of dog food.

"Vincent can buy flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 or in packs of 2 for $1.  Which is cheaper?

* **A.**  Packs of 3
* **B.** Packs of 2

To figure out which is cheaper, we need to see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers with each kind of pack.

* **Packs of 3:** 18 flowers / 3 flowers per pack = 6 packs
* **Packs of 2:** 18 flowers / 2 flowers per pack = 9 packs

The packs of 3 cost $2.50 for 6 packs, so that's $2.50 * 6 = $15.00.

The packs of 2 cost $1.00 for 9 packs, so that's $1.00 * 9 = $9.00.

Vincent saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying 18 flowers with the packs of 2.

"If Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, we can figure out how many Harald sold by thinking about how many copies they sold together. 

We know they sold 88,000 copies in total.  Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies.  Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies.

Together, their sales are:
* Harald's: x copies
* Marilyn's: 10x copies

So, we can write an equation: x + 10x = 88,000

Let's solve for x:
* Combine like terms: 11x = 88,000
* Divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


**Answer:** Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Julia's boat was leaking water!  It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.  That means she rowed at a speed of 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.  To find out how much water the boat took on, we need to know how much water it took per foot.  The boat took 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.  So, to find out how much water it took, we need to multiply the distance she rowed by the amount of water per foot.  She rowed 20 feet, so she took on 2 * (20 feet / 10 feet) = 4 liters of water. 

**Answer:** 4 liters

"Sasha has some lumber to sell!  She has ten 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each, and five 4x4x10 boards that cost $16 each.  

To figure out how much money she makes, we need to know how much she sells each board for.  

Let's say she sells each 2x4x10 board for $15.  

* 2x4x10 boards: $15 * 10 = $150
* 4x4x10 boards: $16 * 5 = $80

"Okay, so Well's mom sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges.  Watermelons cost three times as much as peppers. Oranges cost five dollars less than watermelons. Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will Dillon spend if each pepper costs $15?

Here's how to figure that out:

* **Watermelons:**  Watermelons cost $45 each. Dillon buys 4, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.
* **Peppers:** Peppers cost $15 each. Dillon buys 20, so that's 20 * $15 = $300.
* **Oranges:** Oranges cost $40 each. Dillon buys 10, so that's 10 * $40 = $400.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the things: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

**Answer:** $880

"If we know that 1/3 of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, and 2/3 of those are female, we can find the number of female unicorns. 

Here's how:

* **Step 1: Find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.**
   *  We know that 1/3 of the unicorns are in the Highlands, and there are 27 unicorns in total. So, we can find the number of unicorns in the Highlands by multiplying the total number of unicorns by 1/3: 27 unicorns * (1/3) = 9 unicorns.

* **Step 2: Find the number of female unicorns in the Highlands.**
   * We know that 2/3 of the unicorns in the Highlands are female. So, we can find the number of female unicorns by multiplying the number of unicorns in the Highlands by 2/3: 9 unicorns * (2/3) = 6 unicorns.

"Steve is faster because he can bike!  He's 3 miles away and can bike 440 feet per minute. Tim is 2 miles away and can skateboard 264 feet per minute. 

To find out how long it takes Steve to get home, we need to know how many feet he bikes in a minute.  He bikes 440 feet per minute.

To find out how long it takes Tim to get home, we need to know how many feet he skates in a minute. He skates 264 feet per minute.

Now, let's see who gets home first! 

* Steve takes 36 minutes to bike home.
* Tim takes 40 minutes to skate home.

Tim takes 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes longer than Steve. 

So, the winner will be waiting for **4** minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Seagull eats:** The seagull ate half of the fries Dave had, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. **Pigeons eat:** Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

3. **Fries left:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.

4. **Raccoon eats:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.

5. **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Answer:** There were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. How many fish did they catch in total?

*  a) 19
*  b) 22
*  c) 32
*  d) 35

Answer: c 
 
Let's see how many fish they caught:

* Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish
* Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
* Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
* Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

So, in total, they caught 19 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 32 fish.

"Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In two years, their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?

*  A. 17.34
*  B. 8.67
*  C. 26
*  D. 28


Let's think about this:

If Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can write that as: 
Seth = 2 * Brooke

In two years, their ages will be 28. So, we can write that as:
Seth + Brooke + 2 = 28

"Jessica needs to pay more money each month to pay off her debts.  She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount she has to pay each month. 

Here's how to figure out how much she'll pay:

* **Minimum payments:** She has to pay $300 for her student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. That's a total of $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 each month.
* **Extra money:** She wants to pay 50% more, so she'll pay $1000 * 0.50 = $500 extra each month.
* **Total monthly payment:** She'll pay $1000 + $500 = $1500 each month.
* **Total yearly payment:** She'll pay $1500 * 12 months = $18,000 each year.

"Zaid has 6000 dollars a month. He spends some of it on rent, car fuel, and then gives some to charity. He also gives some money to his daughter and wife. 

* Rent: Zaid spends 1/4 of his money on rent. That's like taking 6000 dollars / 4 = 1500 dollars.
* Car Fuel: He spends 1/3 of his money on car fuel. That's like taking 6000 dollars / 3 = 2000 dollars.
* Total spent: He spends 1500 dollars + 2000 dollars = 3500 dollars.
* Money left: After spending on rent and car fuel, he has 6000 dollars - 3500 dollars = 2500 dollars.
* Charity: He gives half of the money left to charity. That's 2500 dollars / 2 = 1250 dollars.
* Money left after charity: He has 2500 dollars - 1250 dollars = 1250 dollars left.
* Money for daughter and wife: He gives 200 dollars to his daughter and 700 dollars to his wife. That's 200 dollars + 700 dollars = 900 dollars.
* Final money: He has 1250 dollars - 900 dollars = 350 dollars left.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

* The faster team runs each leg in 55 seconds.
* The other team runs their first leg in 60 seconds.
* The other team's runners get faster each time, so they run 3 seconds faster than the last runner. 
* The other team's runners run 60 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 69 seconds.
* The faster team runs 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.
* The faster team wins by 220 - 69 = 38 seconds.

"The rats are in 3 cages.  Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.  We know that 160 pieces of straw were given to the small rodents.  We can figure out how many rats there are by dividing the total straw by the number of pieces each rat gets. 

Here's how:

* 160 pieces of straw / 6 pieces per rat = 26.67 rats. 
* Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

So, there are **6 rats** in each cage.

"Okay, so we have 20 groups of cups, and they cost $1200 less than 6 plates that cost $6000 each.  

To find out how much one cup costs, we need to figure out the total cost of the plates first. 

* Each plate costs $6000.
* We have 6 plates, so the total cost is $6000 * 6 = $36000.

Now, we know the 20 groups of cups cost $34800 less than the plates.

* The cost of the cups is $34800.

To find out how much one cup costs, we need to divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups.

* The total cost of the cups is $34800.
* There are 240 cups in 20 groups.
* So, each cup costs $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Sara wants a jacket and two pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20.  She earns $5 for babysitting and $4 for mowing the lawn. 

To figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, let's see how much money she needs:

* The jacket costs $30 and the shoes cost $20 each, so that's $30 + ($20 * 2) = $70.
* She already has $10 saved.
* She needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.
* She earns $24 for mowing the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $60 / $24 = 2.5 times. 

Sara needs to mow the lawn 3 times.

"Let's think about this problem!

We know Jerry has a total of 42 eggs each day.  The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day.  We also know there are two more white chickens than red chickens. 

Let's use some math to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has.

*  Let's say there are 'r' red chickens.
*  Then there are 'r + 2' white chickens.

To find out how many eggs the red chickens lay, we multiply the number of red chickens by the number of eggs each red chicken lays: 3 * r.

To find out how many eggs the white chickens lay, we multiply the number of white chickens by the number of eggs each white chicken lays: 5 * (r + 2).

Now, we know that the total number of eggs from both the red and white chickens is 42. So, we can write an equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Let's solve for 'r':

* 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
* 8r + 10 = 42
* 8r = 32
* r = 4

So, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

* Gary walks at 3 miles per hour.
* To find how long he walks, we divide the total distance by his speed: 7.5 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2.5 hours.

"Let's think about this!

* Harriet is 21 years old.
* Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* Zack is twice Harriet's age, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

In three years, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
In three years, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

To find the average age, we add all their ages and divide by 3. 
(66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years old.

"Okay, so we have two aquariums.  

* The first aquarium has 4 snails.
* The second aquarium has 32 snails.

The difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  

To find out how many fish are in each aquarium, we need to figure out how many snails are in each aquarium. 

Let's think about it like this:

* The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28.
* The difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 
* So, the number of fish in both aquariums is 28 / 2 = 14.

So, each aquarium has 14 fish.

"Jean has to pay $250 each day for her makeup. She needs it done for 6 hours each day, and she needs it done 4 times a week.  That means she needs to pay $250 * 6 * 4 = $6000 for the makeup.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so she needs to pay $6000 * 5 = $30000.  The makeup artist gives her a 10% discount, so she only has to pay $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

"Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  To find out what floor he is on now, we can use this equation: 

*  x = 4x + 6

Let's solve for x:

* Subtract 4x from both sides: -3x = 6
* Divide both sides by -3: x = -2

So, Bill is on the **-2nd** floor.

"Carla needs 11 cups of flour. 

Here's how we know:

*  She wants to make 66 cookies.
*  She needs 2 cups of flour for every dozen cookies.

"If we have 9,300 pennies, and we want to know how much money we have in a stack with two-thirds of them, we need to figure out how many pennies are in the stack. 

Two-thirds of 9,300 pennies is 9,300 / 3 = 3,100 pennies.

Now, we know that each penny is worth $0.01. So, we can multiply the number of pennies in the stack by the value of one penny to find the total amount of money. 

3,100 pennies * $0.01/penny = $31.00

"The house costs $350,000.  The buyer has to pay a fee for the agent to help find the house, which is 5% of the house's price. That's like 5 out of every 100 dollars.  The buyer also has to pay a fee to transfer the house, which is 12% of the house's price. That's like 12 out of every 100 dollars.  So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500. Mrs. Cruz has $400,000 to spend.  The total cost is $409,500, which is more than her budget by $9,500.

"It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.  After that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the oil, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.  So, it takes 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes to cook the chicken.

"Sean has to memorize 84 lines. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Scene 1:** The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which has 54 lines. So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. 
* **Scene 1:**  The first scene has a third of the lines as Sean's lines. So, Sean has 108 lines / 3 = 36 lines in the first scene.
* **Scene 2:** The second scene has six more lines than the song, which has 54 lines. So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
* **Scene 2:** The second scene has four-fifths of Sean's lines. So, Sean has 60 lines * (4/5) = 48 lines in the second scene.
* **Total:** Sean has to memorize 36 lines + 48 lines = 84 lines.

"Okay, so Carly had 80 cards.  

*  Half of the cards had the letter A on them, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 cards.
*  After taking out the cards with A, she had 80 - 40 = 40 cards left.
*  Half of the remaining cards had the letter B, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 cards.
*  After taking out the cards with B, she had 40 - 20 = 20 cards left.
*  Then, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C, so that's 20 * (5/8) = 12.5 cards.  Since we can't have half a card, we know that not all of the cards with the letter C had the letter C.
*  The rest of the cards had the letter D. 


So, the answer is 9.

"It will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes. 

Here's how:

* He digs 30 small holes, which takes 3 minutes each, so that's 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.
* He digs 15 large holes, which takes 10 minutes each, so that's 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.
* He spends a total of 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.
* 240 minutes is the same as 4 hours.

"Ruby is six times older than Sam. In nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?

Here's how to solve this:

* Let's say Sam is 'S' years old now.
* Ruby is '6S' years old now.

In nine years, Sam will be S + 9 years old. 
Ruby will be 6S + 9 years old.

We know that in nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Let's solve for S:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6

Sam is 6 years old now.

"We know that cobras have 70 spots and mambas have 35 spots.  So, if we have 40 cobras and 60 mambas, we need to find the total number of spots. 

* 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots
* 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots
* 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Now, we need to find half of the total spots. 

* 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

So, the answer is 2450.

"If a car is going 60 miles per hour, and another car is going half as fast, how long would it take the slower car to travel the same distance?

*  A. 10 hours
*  B. 16 hours
*  C. 30 hours
*  D. 48 hours

The slower car is going 30 miles per hour.  We know that distance is the same for both cars.  So, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.  We know the distance is 480 miles, and the speed of the slower car is 30 miles per hour.  So, we can solve for time:

time = distance / speed
time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour
time = 16 hours

So the answer is B. 16 hours.

"Okay, here's how we can figure out the total points:

* Mike has 21 points.
* Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, everyone gets 1 point extra if they have more than 20 points.

* Mike gets 21 + 1 = 22 points.
* Jim gets 18 + 1 = 19 points.
* Tony gets 42 + 1 = 43 points.

So, in total, they have 22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points.

"Okay, let's figure out how much you'll save!

* **Ice cream:** The ice cream is now $11, and it cost $13 before.  That means you save $13 - $11 = $2 for each tub.
* **Milk:** We need to know how much the milk costs to figure out how much you save on it. 

Let's say the milk costs $2.  

* **Total cost of ice cream:** 2 tubs of ice cream cost $26.
* **Total cost of milk:** 4 packets of milk cost $8 (because we need to know the original price of the milk to calculate the discount). 

* **Total cost of the whole thing:** $26 (ice cream) + $8 (milk) = $34.

"The football team has 105 players.  The offense has twice as many players as the defense.  The special teams have half as many players as the defense.  How many players are on the defense?

**Answer:** 30 
 
Let's think about it like this:

* We know the defense has 'x' players.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so they have 2 * x players.
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense, so they have x / 2 players.

If we add up all the players, we get 105: x + 2x + x / 2 = 105 

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: (3/2)x + x = 105
* Simplify: (5/2)x = 105
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 105 * (2/5) = 42 

So, there are 42 players on the defense.

"Job B pays more than Job A.  Here's why:

* **Job A:** Nick gets $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year. That's $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.
* **Job A Tax:**  The state takes 20% of his pay, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
* **Job A Net Pay:**  After the tax, Nick gets $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

* **Job B:** Nick gets $42,000 a year.
* **Job B Tax:** The state takes 10% of the money left after paying for the house, which is $42,000 * 0.10 = $4,200.
* **Job B Net Pay:** After the tax, Nick gets $42,000 - $4,200 = $37,800.

Job B is better because Nick makes $37,800 - $24,000 = $13,800 more.

"Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm.  He has twice as many chickens as cows. How many legs do the animals have all together?

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Let's use some simple math:**  We know the number of chickens is twice the number of cows.  
* **Let's use a secret code:**  We can use the letters C for chickens and W for cows.
* **We know:** C + W = 60 
* **We also know:** C = 2W

**Let's solve for the number of cows (W):**

* We can use the second equation to help us.  Since C = 2W, we can substitute that into the first equation.
* So, 2W + W = 60
* Combine the W's: 3W = 60
* Divide both sides by 3: W = 20

**Now that we know how many cows there are, we can find how many chickens there are:**

* We know C = 2W, so C = 2 * 20 = 40

**Finally, let's count all the legs!**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* In total, the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that to go from the third city to the first city.  That means the train goes 100 - 50 = 50 miles from the third city to the first city.

The train travels 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles in one trip.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  So, to know how many days it takes to go 18,000 miles, we need to divide 18,000 by 225. 

18,000 miles / 225 miles per day = 80 days.

"We need to figure out how much money we need to spend on the gifts.

* **Picture frames:** We need 44 picture frames, and each one costs $20. So, that's 44 * $20 = $880.
* **Etching:** Each frame needs a special etching that costs an extra 20% of the frame's price. That's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra for each frame. So, we need to add $4 * 44 = $176 for the etching.
* **Pins:** Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
* **Cords:** 1/4 of the seniors are officers, and they need cords that cost $12 each. That's (1/4) * 44 * $12 = $132 for the cords.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198. 

**Answer:** $1198

"Mr. Ruther sold some of his land, and now he has 12.8 hectares left.  To find out how much land he had at first, we need to think about how much land he had before he sold any. 

Let's use a simple way to think about it:

* If he has 12.8 hectares left, and he sold 3/5 of his land, we can think of it like this: 
   * He had 12.8 hectares left, and he sold 3/5 of his land. 
   * To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out how much land he had before he sold any. 

* We can use a simple equation to help us: 
   *  (2/5) * x = 12.8 
   *  Where 'x' is the amount of land he had at first.

* Let's solve for 'x':
   *  Multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
   *  Calculate: x = 32 hectares

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Wilson needs a grade of 80 or higher in math to get the car.  He got 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74 on his tests.  To find his average, we need to add all the numbers together: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.  Then, we divide that number by the number of tests: 400 / 5 = 80.  So, Wilson's grade is 80!

"Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5 to 6.  That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  If they have a total of 165 popsicles, how many more popsicles does Sam have than Betty?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Find the value of one part:**  If they have 165 popsicles together, and the ratio is 5:6, we need to find out what each part is worth.  
* **Think of it like a pie:** Imagine the popsicles are cut into 11 pieces (5 + 6). Each piece is worth 165 popsicles / 11 pieces = 15 popsicles.
* **Betty's popsicles:** Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
* **Sam's popsicles:** Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.
* **The difference:** Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Carol spent 4 hours writing the song, then 2 hours recording it.  She also spent 90 minutes editing.  To find out what percentage of her time she spent editing, we need to figure out how much time she spent editing as a fraction of her total time.

First, let's convert the time spent editing to hours: 90 minutes is equal to 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time she spent: 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.

Finally, we can find the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and multiplying by 100%: (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%.

So the answer is 20%.

"Okay, so Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power every hour.  He uses it for 8 hours a day.  If he uses it for 3 hours less each day, how much less power will he use in 30 days?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* **Daily power use:** Mel uses 900 watts per hour * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours each day.
* **Reduced power use:** He uses 900 watts per hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours each day.
* **Energy saved:** He saves 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours each day.
* **Energy saved in 30 days:** He saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Energy saved in kWh:** That's the same as 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours.


**Answer:** 135 kWh

"Let's look at the zebras:

* One zebra has 36 stripes.
* Another zebra has half the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.
*  So, the zebras have a total of 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.
*  We have 3 zebras, so the average number of stripes is 88 / 3 = 29.33 stripes.

"Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.  Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne.  So, her sister gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The sisters have a total of 500 apples.  Let's say Joanne gathered 'x' apples from the average trees.  

We know that Joanne's apples from the tallest trees + Joanne's apples from the shortest trees + Joanne's apples from the average trees = 500.

So, 30 + 15 + x = 500.

Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 30 - 15 = 455.

"We know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump.  We also know that there are 180 heads in total. Let's use that information to figure out how many dromedaries there are.

We can write this as an equation:

*  c + d = 180  (where 'c' is the number of camels and 'd' is the number of dromedaries)

We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one.  This means:

* 2c + d = 304 (where 'c' is the number of camels and 'd' is the number of dromedaries)

Now we can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries). 

Let's use the first equation to find the value of 'c'. 
* c = 180 - d

Now we can substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Let's solve for 'd':

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

"Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. 

Here's how we know:

* Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
* Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
* To find out how big Zack's locker is, we need to figure out how many times bigger Peter's locker is than Zack's. 
* Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and Zack's locker is 4 times smaller than Peter's locker. 
* So, Zack's locker is 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.
* Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. 
* So, Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

"Bill has to pay for the service for 2 years, which is 24 months. 

* First, he pays $8 a month for 6 months, that's $8 * 6 = $48.
* Then, he pays $12 a month for 2 months, that's $12 * 2 = $24.

"The area of Billie's room is 360 square feet.  If the length of his room is 3 yards, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?

*  A. 98 feet
*  B. 196 feet
*  C. 294 feet
*  D. 360 feet

The answer is **A. 98 feet**. 
 
Here's how to find the perimeter:

* We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.
* We know the area is 360 square feet.
* We know the length is 3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet.
* We can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.
* The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width: 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"If we look at the puppies, Jennifer has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon has 4 puppies with spots.  That's a total of 7 puppies with spots.  We also know that Jennifer has 8 puppies and Brandon has 12 puppies.  So, there are 20 puppies in total.  To find out what percentage of puppies have spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100.  That gives us 7/20 * 100 = 35%. 

**Answer:** 35%

"Okay, so we have 30 students and they start with 10 pencils each.  After two months, they use some pencils.  We know that 1/5 of the pencils were used.  So, we need to figure out how many pencils are left.

Then, after a while, only 1/3 of the pencils are left.  We need to find out how many pencils are left. 


Let's solve it step by step:

1. **Pencils used:**  We know that 1/5 of the pencils were used.  So, we need to figure out how many pencils were used.  We can do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of pencils each student has. 
   - 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils
   - 300 pencils * (1/5) = 60 pencils used

2. **Pencils left:**  We know that 60 pencils were used.  So, we need to figure out how many pencils are left.  We can do this by subtracting the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils.
   - 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils

3. **Pencils left after a while:**  We know that 1/3 of the pencils are left.  So, we need to figure out how many pencils are left.  We can do this by multiplying the number of pencils left by 1/3.
   - 240 pencils * (1/3) = 80 pencils

**Answer:** 80 pencils

"Matt wants cookies, but his dad wants him to eat healthy.  He says he can have half as many cookies as carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, how many carrot sticks does he need to eat?

Here's how to solve it:

* Let's say Matt eats 'x' carrot sticks.
* He gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies. 
* So, he gets 0.5 * x + 2 cookies.
* We know he wants 5 cookies in total.
* We can write an equation: 0.5 * x + 2 = 5

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5 * x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"The remoras are like little fish that stick to the shark's body.  They are like tiny friends!  

To find out what percentage of the shark is made up of the remoras, we need to figure out how long the remoras are compared to the whole shark.

The remoras are 72 inches long. The shark is 120 inches long. 

To find out what percentage the remoras make up, we can do this:

* 72 inches / 120 inches = 0.6
* 0.6 * 100% = 60%

So, the remoras make up 60% of the shark's body! 


**Answer:** 60%

"Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats every day.
* He has 4 horses.
* He eats 5 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 20 pounds of oats each day.
* He needs oats for 5 days, so he needs 20 pounds/day * 5 days = 100 pounds of oats.
* Each bag has 50 pounds of oats.
* So, he needs 100 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 2 bags.

"Okay, so Mark has two choices for his wife's party!  

Venue 1 is like a flat fee, it costs $200 no matter how many people come.  Venue 2 is like a special price per person.  

To figure out when they cost the same, we need to figure out how many people need to come to each place. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Venue 1:**  It costs $200 plus $5 for each person.
* **Venue 2:** It costs $25 for each person.

If we want them to be the same, we need to find the number of people that make the two prices the same.

"Lily found 14 insects. 

Here's how we know:

* Bodhi found x insects.
* David found half of Bodhi's insects, which is x/2.
* Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7.

Together they found 43 insects, so:
x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Let's solve for x:
* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now we know Bodhi found 14.4 insects.  
* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

If Shiloh is 44 years old now, in 7 years he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.  

Let's think about how old his nephew will be in 7 years.  

In 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be three times as old as his nephew is today.  

Let's say his nephew is 'x' years old today.  In 7 years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be three times as old as his nephew is today.  So, we can write the equation: 3 * (x + 7) = 51

Let's solve for x:

3x + 21 = 51
3x = 30
x = 10

So, his nephew is 10 years old today.

"The carpet costs $12 per square foot, and we need to add $2 for padding.  So, the carpet costs 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.  The carpet costs 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.  The padding costs 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.  The removal costs 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.  The installation costs 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7456.

"Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.  So, Juan's house costs 70% of Herb's house.

Herb's house costs $76,000.  To find out how much Juan's house costs, we need to multiply Herb's house price by 70%.

70% of $76,000 = (70/100) * $76,000 = $53,200

Juan's house costs $53,200.  To find the total cost of both houses, we need to add their prices.

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The total cost of both houses is $129,200.

"The jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.  We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500.  

Let's think about it like this:

* If we have 'b' jelly beans that are blue, we know there are 0.99 times as many red jelly beans as blue jelly beans.
* We also know there are 1.01 times as many green jelly beans as blue jelly beans.

So, we can write an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Let's solve for 'b':

* Combine the 'b' terms: 2.99b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

Now, we know there are 1500 blue jelly beans.  To find out how many green jelly beans there are, we can use the equation:

1.01b = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

So, there are 1515 green jelly beans! 

**Answer:** There are 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

* Cheerios weight loss: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
* Donuts weight gain: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds
* The difference is 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds.

"Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  To find out how old he'll be in three years, we need to figure out how old he is now.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago, we can write that as an equation:  x = 2(x - 5)

Let's solve for x:

* x = 2x - 10
* x - 2x = -10
* -x = -10
* x = 10

So, Jerry is 10 years old now. In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants. Each implant costs $2000. One of them needs a special crown that costs $500 more. He already paid $600. How many hours does he need to work to pay for the dental work?

a) 100 hours
b) 150 hours
c) 293 hours
d) 300 hours

Answer: c 
 
To figure this out, we need to know how much the implants cost in total.  The implants cost $2000 each, and he needs two, so that's $2000 * 2 = $4000. Then, he needs to add the crown cost, which is $500. So, the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.  He already paid $600, so he needs to work to pay for $4500 - $600 = $3900.  To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to pay by his hourly wage. He makes $15 per hour, so he needs to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Okay, so we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  

Let's think about the angles:

* We know one angle is twice the smallest angle.
* We know one angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's use a little trick to find the biggest angle!

If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other two angles are:

* Twice the smallest: 2x
* Three times the smallest: 3x

Now, we know that all the angles add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the x's: 6x = 180
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the biggest angle. The biggest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

* **Nickels:** 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
* **Pennies:** 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15
* **Total money:** $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45
* **Gumballs:** $3.45 / $0.05/gumball = 69 gumballs

So Colby can buy 69 gumballs!

* Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
* Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

In total, the pets have 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.

"Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in two hours.  If they work for 12 hours, how much chocolate do they make together?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Ruiz's chocolate per hour:** Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's chocolate per hour:** Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes, so she makes (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.
* **Total chocolate:**  They work for 12 hours, so Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.
* **Total chocolate together:** They make 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds of chocolate.

"If a car drives 2 miles and its tires turn 725 times, then for 400 miles, the tires will turn 725 * 400 = 290,000 times.  

To figure out how many years it will take for the tires to wear out, we need to know how many times the tires turn in a year.  If the tires turn 10,440,000 times in a year, then it will take 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 3.6 years. 

So the answer is 3.6 years.

"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his field trip.  The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35.  The store has a sale, so the shirt is 30% off!  That means he gets to pay $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 for the shirt.  The shorts cost $35.  So, the total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.  The store might charge a little extra for the outfit, so we need to add a little bit more money.  Let's say the store charges 6% for the sale.  That means the total cost is $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65.

Here's how we know:

* Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
* He works 10 hours a day.
* The bull weighs 750 kg. 

So, he can sell 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg of meat each day.

"It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.  Pork took 20 more minutes than rice, so it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork. Beans took half the time of rice and pork combined, so it took her 30 + 50 = 80 minutes to cook all the food.

"If the total number of legs is 70, and the total number of heads is 20, how many sheep are on Lee's farm?

*  **A.** 10
*  **B.** 15
*  **C.** 20
*  **D.** 25

We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  We can write an equation to find the number of sheep.

"Let's think about this problem!

We know there are twins and triplets.  One twin is older than one of the triplets.  The twins and triplets are a total of 44 years old.  

To find out how old the twin is, we need to figure out how old the triplets are. 

Let's use the information we have:

* **Let 't' be the age of the twin.**
* **Let '3t' be the age of the triplet.**

We know that the sum of the twin's age and the triplet's age is 44.  So, we can write an equation:

t + 3t = 44

Now, let's solve for 't':

* 4t = 44
* t = 44 / 4
* t = 11

So, the twin is 11 years old!

* Candies cost $1.20 for 4 candies, so 10 candies cost $1.20 * 10 = $12.00
* So, the total cost is $4.00 + $12.00 = $16.00

"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins. So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

"Brittany's comforter has a lot of squares!  Let's figure out how big it is.

* **Red squares:** She has 14 red squares.
* **Blue squares:** She has 4 more blue squares than red, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
* **Green squares:** She has 6 more green squares than blue, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* **White squares:** She has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.
* **Total squares:**  She has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.
* **Total square feet:**  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 * 1 = 68 square feet.

"If the ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, that means it makes 50 quarts every hour.  

If it takes 4 hours to make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream, that means it makes 12.5 quarts every hour.

To find out how much ice cream they make in 48 hours, we need to add the amount of chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream. 

So, the total amount of ice cream they make in 48 hours is 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts. 

And, 12.5 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 500 quarts.

So, the total amount of ice cream they make in 48 hours is 2400 quarts + 500 quarts = 2900 quarts. 

**Answer:** 2900 quarts

"The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time the cat takes.  

To find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we need to figure out how long it takes the dog to eat 9 sausages.

"Topher's shoes are really big!  Let's figure out how long Bobby's shoes are.

We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  Let's use an equation to help us:

*  Let Bobby's shoe be represented by 'x'

We can write the equation: 100 = 9x + 10

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x
* Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long!

"If Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice, and each kilogram costs $3, then to make 4 liters of juice, he'll need 4 times the amount of oranges. 

To find out how much it costs, we need to multiply the cost per kilogram by the number of kilograms needed. 

* Cost per kilogram: $3
* Number of kilograms needed: 4 liters * 5 kilograms/liter = 20 kilograms
* Total cost: $3 * 20 kilograms = $60

So, Sam will need to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

**Answer:** $60

"Tanya earned $105 for the two days. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Monday:** She worked 5 hours and got $15 per hour, so she earned $75.  She also got $5 extra for teaching 4 classes, so she earned $80 that day.
* **Wednesday:** She worked 2 hours and got $15 per hour, so she earned $30. She also got $5 extra for teaching 2 classes, so she earned $25 that day. 

So, her total earnings for the two days were $80 + $25 = $105.

"Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave some to Brandon, and then some to Charlie.  He kept the rest.  

* Brandon got 1/2 of the pencils, which is 50 / 2 = 25 pencils.
* After giving some to Brandon, Anthony had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.
* Then, he gave some to Charlie, which is 3/5 of the pencils left, which is 25 * 3/5 = 15 pencils.
* Anthony kept the rest, which is 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"Mike has a lot of movies!  He wants to switch to digital.  He has 600 movies.  He knows he can get 1/3 of his movies in a special set for only $6 each.  That's like getting a deal!  The rest of his movies are regular movies.  40% of the rest are old movies that cost $5 each.  How much will it cost to buy all the movies?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Movies in a special set:** Mike has 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in a special set.
* **Movies not in a special set:** Mike has 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.
* **Old movies:** 400 movies * $5/movie = $2000
* **Regular movies:** 400 movies
* **Total cost:** $2000 + (400 movies * $10/movie) = $2000 + $4000 = $6000

**Answer:** $6000

"The family drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour.  They also hiked for 1.5 hours.  They hiked at 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.  

To find out how far the vacation spot is, we need to know how far they drove and how far they hiked. 

* They drove 6 hours * 50 miles per hour = 300 miles.
* They hiked for 1.5 hours * 20 miles per hour = 30 miles.
* The total distance to the vacation spot is 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

So the answer is 330 miles.

"They will plant a total of 1240 trees! 

Here's how we know:

* **Students:** 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
* **Teachers:** 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers
* **Total trees planted by students:** 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees
* **Total trees planted by teachers:** 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees
* **Total trees planted:** 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

"Bubbles wants to have 30% of her stuffed animals be goats.  She has 14 stuffed animals in total.  To find out how many goats she needs, we need to figure out what 30% of 14 is. 

Here's how:

* 30% is the same as 30 out of 100.
* So, 30% of 14 is (30/100) * 14 = 4.2 goats.

Since she can't have half a goat, Bubbles needs to buy 5 goats.

We started with 10 quarts left, so we had 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts of tea at the beginning.

"Okay, so we know Jack and his friends play games at the arcade.  

* Jack plays for 20 minutes per game.
* Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack.
* One friend can play for a little longer than Jack.

Let's figure out how much they spend!

* Jack plays for 240 minutes.
* Two friends play for 120 minutes and 60 minutes.
* The friend who plays the longest plays for 360 minutes.
* They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

So, they play for a total of 240 + 120 + 60 + 360 = 780 minutes.

To figure out how much they spend, we need to know how many games they play. Jack plays 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games.

They spend $3.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Tanya makes a salt scrub, and she wants to make sure she uses the right amounts of each ingredient.  She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt. 

Here's what we know:

* **Zest = Fragrance**
* **Salt = Sugar**
* **Oil = 2 * Salt**

To find out how much oil Tanya uses, we need to figure out how much salt she uses. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Salt = Sugar**

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20 cars.  So Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Joe gives away twice the number he sold to his mom, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.

"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food.  Each cat food package has 11 tins and each dog food package has 6 tins.  To find out how many more cat food tins she bought than dog food tins, we need to do a little math. 

First, we need to find the total number of cat food tins: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins.

Then, we need to find the total number of dog food tins: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.

Now, we can find the difference: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins.

So, Kimberly bought 52 more cat food tins than dog food tins.

"Becca has 153 cards! 

Here's how we know:

* PJ has some cards.
* Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.

Let's use some math to figure it out! 

* We know PJ has 'x' cards.
* Smendrick has 3 times that, so he has 3 * x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3 * x + 12 cards.

If we add up all the cards, we get 341.  So, we can write an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve for x:

* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3 times that amount plus 12 more:

* Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards!

"Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month.  He made 8,000 bars in the first week.  The second week, he made half as much as the first week, so he made 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.  The third week, he made three times as much as the first week, so he made 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.  That's a lot of chocolate!  To find out how much he made in the fourth week, we need to subtract the chocolate he made in the first three weeks from his total monthly chocolate bars.  So, he made 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Britany spends a lot of time on TikTok! 

* She makes 18 videos each week.
* She spends 2 hours writing songs, which is like 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

* In a week, she spends 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 210 minutes on TikTok.
* In a month, she spends 210 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 840 minutes on TikTok.

So the answer is 840 minutes.

"The cost of the installation is $129.00 for the basic stuff.  Then, we need to add for the mirrors, the chandeliers, and the pictures.  

* Mirrors: Angela has 6 mirrors, and each one costs $15.00 to hang. So, she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* Chandeliers: Angela has 2 chandeliers, and each one costs $15.00 to hang. So, she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* Pictures: Angela has 20 pictures, and each one costs $15.00 to hang. So, she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.

"We need to find out how much glue is left in the glue sticks that are not used. 

*  We know that the glue sticks are 12 millimeters long. 
*  We need to find out how much glue is left in the glue sticks that are not used. 

Let's look at the glue sticks that are not used. 

*  The first glue stick has 1/6 left.
*  The second glue stick has 2/3 left.
*  The third glue stick has 1/2 left.

To find out how much glue is left in the glue sticks that are not used, we need to add up the amount of glue that is left in each of the glue sticks. 

*  1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3

*  We know that 4/3 is the amount of glue that is left in the glue sticks that are not used. 

*  We know that 12 mm is the original length of the glue sticks. 

*  We know that 4/3 is the amount of glue that is left in the glue sticks that are not used. 

*  We can find out how much glue is left in the glue sticks that are not used by subtracting the amount of glue that is used from the original length of the glue sticks. 

*  The amount of glue that is left in the glue sticks that are not used is 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 32 mm.

"If we clean half the rooms, we need to clean 45 rooms.  It takes 20 minutes to clean each room, so we need to know how many minutes it takes to clean 45 rooms. 

To find that, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean one room: 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes.

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60: 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.

**Answer:** 15

"The town will build a total of 144 homes over the next three years. 

Here's how:

* Year 1: 12 homes
* Year 2: 3 times 12 homes = 36 homes
* Year 3: Double the homes built in the first two years, so 36 homes + 12 homes = 48 homes. 
* Total: 12 + 36 + 48 = 96 homes 
 
So, the town will have built 96 homes in the third year.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

*  My brother is three years older than me, so he's 28 + 3 = 31 years old.
*  I'm two years younger than my sister, so she's 28 - 2 = 26 years old.
*  Mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so she's 31 - 1 = 30 years old.

Now, let's add up our ages: 28 + 31 + 26 + 30 = 115. 

So, the answer is 115.

"If each person infects 6 other people each day, we can figure out how many people are infected after 3 days. 

* Day 1: 10 people are infected, and each infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 new people get sick.
* Day 2: 60 people are infected, and each infects 6 others, so 60 * 6 = 360 new people get sick.
* Day 3: 360 people are infected, and each infects 6 others, so 360 * 6 = 2160 new people get sick.

So, after 3 days, there are 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = 2630 people infected.

"Wendy earns more badges than Amber.  

Here's how we know:

* Claire gets 1 badge each month.
* Amber gets half as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1/2 badge each month.
* Wendy gets three times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 3 times the amount of badges Claire gets.

So, Wendy gets 3 * 1 = 3 badges each month.

To find out how many more badges Wendy gets than Amber, we need to find the difference.

Wendy gets 3 - 1/2 = 2.5 more badges each month than Amber.

Over a year, Wendy gets 2.5 badges/month * 12 months = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.  Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  

We know that together they have 85 books.  

Let's use the letters to help us:

*  Let Fawn's books be represented by ""F""
*  Anne's books are ""F - 12""
*  Sofie's books are ""F - 12 + 25""

Now we can write an equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Let's solve for F:

* 3F + 13 = 85
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

So, Fawn has 24 books! 


**Answer:**  Fawn has 24 books.

"Isaias wants to make $2000. He has 300 chickens and wants to sell 3/5 of them.  To figure out how much he spent on the chickens, we need to do a few steps.

* **Step 1: How many chickens will he sell?**
   * He's selling 3/5 of his chickens, which is (3/5) * 300 chickens = 180 chickens.

* **Step 2: How much money will he make?**

"If Melanie is 8 years old now, in 10 years she will be 18.  To find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age, we can think about it like this:

* Melanie's age in 10 years: 18
* Melanie's age now: 8
* We want to find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Melanie's age in 'x' years: 8 + x
* We want her age to be three times her current age, so: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

So, it will take Melanie **16** years for her age to be three times her current age.

* Chicken: Each chicken pack costs twice as much as bacon, so it costs $10 * 2 = $20. She has 6 packs, so that's $20 * 6 = $120.
* Strawberries: 3 packs cost $4 each, so that's $4 * 3 = $12.
* Apples: Each apple pack costs half the price of a strawberry, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2. She has 7 packs, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Now let's add up all the costs: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

"Elaina's final concert was longer than her usual concerts.  She made it twice as long!  That means her final concert was 65 minutes long.  To find out how long her usual concerts are, we need to figure out how many minutes are in her final concert.  

If her final concert is 65 minutes long, and it's twice as long as her usual concerts, we can figure out how long her usual concerts are by dividing the final concert's time by 2. 

So, 65 minutes / 2 = 32.5 minutes. 

**Answer:** 32.5 minutes

"Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo.  Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.  

Let's use the information we know to figure out how many points Azibo scored.

* We know that Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo.
* We also know that Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use these clues to figure out how many points Azibo scored. 

*  Let's say Dinar scored D points.
*  Then, Azibo scored A points.
*  Bahati scored B points.

We know that the total points for the team is 45.  So, we can write an equation:

A + D + B = 45

We can use the clues we have to figure out what A, D, and B are. 

* We know that B = A + 20
* We also know that B = D + 10

Let's substitute these into our equation:

(A + D + B) = 45
(A + D + (A + 20)) = 45
(2A + D + 20) = 45

Now we can solve for A. 

* We know that A = D - 10. 
* Let's substitute this into our equation:
   (2(D - 10) + D + 20) = 45
   (2D - 20 + D + 20) = 45
   (3D) = 45
   D = 15

* Now that we know D, we can find A:
   A = D - 10
   A = 15 - 10
   A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and some of them are filled.  

*  We know that 1/5 of the beds are filled. That means 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds are filled. 
*  The hospital gets 50 new patients each day. 
*  In two weeks, they get 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.
*  So, we have 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 empty beds.

"If Kelly is right, then Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%.  To find the real number of people, we need to take away 20% of the number Courtney said. 

Here's how to do that:

* Courtney said there were 48 people.
* 20% of 48 is 48 * (20/100) = 9.6 people.
* To find the real number, we subtract the overstatement from Courtney's original number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 people.

So, there were **38.4** people at the concert.

"Jen needs $400 for supplies and travel.  The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies.  How much does the travel cost?

* **A.** $114.29

* **D.** $400


The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies, so it's 1.5 times the price of the supplies.  We know the supplies cost $400.  So, the travel cost is 1.5 times $400, which is $600.

"Alex caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.  Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.  Together, they caught 339 Pokemon. How many Pokemon did Stan catch?

Here's how we can figure that out:

* Let's use letters to represent the number of Pokemon each person caught:
    * Alex: A
    * Stan: S
    * Adelwolfe: W

* We know:
    * A = S + 5 
    * S = 4W - 13
    * A + S + W = 339

* Let's use the first two equations to help us find S:
    * A = S + 5
    * S = 4W - 13

* Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:
    * A = (4W - 13) + 5
    * A = 4W - 8

* Now we can plug this into the third equation:
    * (4W - 8) + S + W = 339

* Let's simplify:
    * 5W - 8 + S = 339

* We know S = 4W - 13, so let's substitute that in:
    * 5W - 8 + (4W - 13) = 339

* Combine like terms:
    * 9W - 21 = 339

* Add 21 to both sides:
    * 9W = 360

* Divide both sides by 9:
    * W = 40.56

* Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, let's round W to 41.

* Now we can find S:
    * S = 4W - 13
    * S = 4(41) - 13
    * S = 164 - 13
    * S = 151

**Answer:** Stan caught 151 Pokemon.

"Walter's lawyer is going to give $3800. 

Here's how we know:

* Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund.
* Together, that's $500 + $1500 = $2000.
* His lawyer is going to give three times the amount Walter and his friends got, so he's going to give $2000 * 3 = $6000.
* Walter and his friends got $2000 + $200 = $2200.
* So, his lawyer will give $6000 - $2200 = $3800.

If each kid gets a slice of watermelon that's the same size, and the adults get twice as big a slice, we can figure out how much of the watermelon each adult gets. 

* **Think of it like sharing:** If we have 6 slices of watermelon, and 2 adults and 4 kids, we need to figure out how much each adult gets. 

* **The adults get twice the size of the kids' slices:**  So, the adults get 2 times the size of the kids' slices. 

* **We can figure out the percentage:**  To figure out the percentage, we need to know how much of the watermelon each adult gets.

"Jordan needs to make the cake by 5:00 pm.  That means she needs to start making it before 5:00 pm.  

Here's how long it will take:

* Making the batter: 20 minutes
* Baking the cake: 30 minutes
* Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
* Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

So, the cake will take 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes to make.

To figure out when she needs to start, let's subtract the time it will take to make the cake from 5:00 pm.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"The pool is 14 feet long, 25 feet wide, and 4 feet deep.  To find out how much water the pool needs, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.  

* Length x Width x Depth = Volume

So, 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Now, we need to know how many gallons are in 1400 cubic feet.  

* 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.

So, 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10,392 gallons.

The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon.  To find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon.

* 10,392 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $1039.20

So, it will cost $1039.20 to fill the pool. 


**Answer:** $1039.20

"Okay, so we have a big tank that can hold 18,000 gallons of water. Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill it up. 

On the first day, Wanda fills up a quarter of the tank, which is 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons. Then Ms. B helps by filling up 3/4 of what Wanda filled, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.  

On the second day, Wanda fills up 2/3 of the amount she filled the first day, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B fills up 1/3 of the amount she filled the first day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

Together, they fill up a total of 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

So, how much water is left? We can find that by subtracting the amount they filled from the total amount of water in the tank: 18,000 - 4,125 = 13,875 gallons.

"Teresa sells big stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones.  She made $120 from selling the stuffed animals. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

* **Let's use 'x' to represent the number of big stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as big ones, so she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The big stuffed animals cost $12 each, and she sold 12x of them.**
* **The small stuffed animals cost $4 each, and she sold 2x of them.**
* **The total amount of money she made is $120.**
* **So, 12 * x + 4 * 2x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 12x + 8x = $120**
* **That means 20x = $120**
* **To find out how many small stuffed animals she sold, we divide both sides by 20.**
* **So, x = 6**

"Okay, so we have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.  Each dwarf mines 18 pounds of ore a day.  

To find out how much they mine in a month, we need to do this:

* **Dwarves mining per day:** 40 dwarves * 18 pounds/dwarf = 720 pounds
* **Dwarves mining in a month:** 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds

So the answer is 21,600 pounds.

"The store sells sandwiches in different sizes.  The first size has 2 sandwiches for $3. The second size has 4 sandwiches for $6.  We know that the price of each sandwich is the same for all sizes.  So, the price of the 8-sandwich size is $1.50 per sandwich.  

The answer is $12.00.

"Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  She had 40% of her red balloons pop, so she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.  She let go of half of her yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.  Then, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 6 of them to her balloons.  Sally had 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

"There are a few ways Marcus could get out of doing his homework.  

*  Sometimes there's a substitute teacher, and they don't want to collect the homework. That's 50% of the time.
*  Even if the regular teacher is there, she might give everyone an extra day to do it. That's 40% of the time.
*  If the teacher doesn't give an extension, Marcus might be able to tell her his dog ate his homework. That's 20% of the time.

So, to figure out the chance Marcus has to do his homework, we need to think about all the ways he might not have to do it. 

*  If the substitute teacher is there, he might not have to do it. That's 20% of the time.
*  If the regular teacher gives everyone an extension, he might not have to do it. That's 12% of the time.
*  If he doesn't get an extension, he might be able to tell the teacher his dog ate his homework. That's 8% of the time.

So, the chance Marcus has to do his homework is 100% - 20% - 12% - 8% = 60%. 



**Answer:** 60%

"It takes Jim 4 years to finish college.  He gets $50,000 a year in loans.  His job before college was $25,000 a year.  His degree makes his job worth $75,000 a year.  So, he makes $75,000 a year while in college.  He needs to make $200,000 to pay back his loans.  He also lost $100,000 while in college.  So, he needs to make $300,000.  It will take him 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years to make that much. 

**Answer:** 4 years

"Jim needs two pieces of fabric.  Each piece is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  So, the fabric pieces are 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.  To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to find the area of the bed and then double it.  The bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  So, Jim needs 48 * 2 = 96 square feet of fabric. 

**Answer:** 96

"Okay, so we have three people sharing $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first person.  The third person got twice what the second person got.  

To figure out how much the first person got, we need to think about how much each person got.

* **Let's use some simple math:**
    *  The second person got $80 more than the first person, so we can write that as:  $80 + the first person's share.
    * The third person got twice the amount the second person got, so we can write that as: 2 * ($80 + the first person's share).

* **Now we can write an equation:**
    * The total amount of money divided by the number of people equals the amount each person gets.  So we can write: ($80 + the first person's share) + ($80 + the first person's share) + 2 * ($80 + the first person's share) = $1920

* **Let's solve for the first person's share:**
    *  We can simplify the equation to: $80 + the first person's share + $80 + the first person's share + 2 * ($80 + the first person's share) = $1920
    *  This means we need to find the first person's share. 

* **To find the first person's share, we can use a little bit of math:**
    *  Let's say the first person's share is represented by the variable 'x'. 
    *  We can write the equation as: x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920
    *  Now we can solve for 'x'. 
    *  Simplifying the equation: 4x + $160 = $1920
    *  Subtracting $160 from both sides: 4x = $1760
    *  Dividing both sides by 4: x = $440

**Answer:** The first person got $440.

"The painters worked for 63/8 days.  That's like 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  So, they worked for 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.  That's 21 days * 3/8 of a day/day = 63/8 days.  Each painter worked for 189 hours.  So, each painter worked 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours.

"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. Then, 20 more people get on at the first stop.  That's 120 + 20 = 140 people. 

At the second stop, 50 people get off, and then 2 times that number, which is 50 * 2 = 100 people get on.  So, there are 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people on the train.

At the third stop, 80 more people get off.  So, there are 190 - 80 = 110 people left.

The final answer is 110 people.

"Alison bought a tank top for $10.  Then she got shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.  She also got tennis shoes that were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.  Finally, she bought some socks for $2 off, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.  All together, Alison spent $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

"To figure out how much it will cost to buy tiles for your kitchen, we need to know how many tiles you need. 

* **Step 1:**  Your kitchen floor is 200 square feet.
* **Step 2:** Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot.
* **Step 3:** To find out how many tiles you need, we divide the area of your kitchen floor by the size of each tile. 200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles.

Now, each tile costs $12. So, to find out how much it will cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the price of each tile. 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

"James has to pay more for his insurance now because he had an accident.  His normal insurance cost is $120 a month.  The extra cost is 60% of the normal cost.  So, he pays $120 + (60/100) * $120 = $120 + $72 = $192 a month.  To find out how much he pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.  So, he pays $192 * 12 = $2304 a year.

"Imma has 3 cats and she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time.  To figure out how many days the food will last, we need to know how much food she uses in a day.  She uses 60 grams per feeding, and she feeds them twice a day, so she uses 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams of food each day.  To find out how many days the food will last, we divide the total amount of food (720 grams) by the amount she uses each day (120 grams).  That gives us 720 grams / 120 grams = 6 days.

"Betsy's part was 18 minutes longer than Donovan's.  

If Donovan took 'x' minutes, Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes. Together, their time was 98 minutes. 

So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 18) = 98

Let's solve for x:

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. 


Answer: 58

"Last week, the Science Center had a lot of classes!  On Monday, 32 classes came.  On Tuesday, twice as many came as on Monday, so 32 * 2 = 64 classes came.  On Wednesday, three times as many came as on Monday, so 32 * 3 = 96 classes came.  That's a total of 32 + 64 + 96 = 192 classes.  Then, on Thursday, 30 more classes came, and on Friday, 25 more came.  So, in total, 192 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes came to the Science Center last week. 

**Answer:** 247

The average score is 95.

"Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of the original price, which is $1500. Then, he sold it for 120% of that price, which is $1800.  

To find out how much he saved, we need to find the difference between the original price and the selling price.  The difference is $200.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the difference by the original price and multiply by 100.  

The discount is $200 / $2000 * 100% = 10%. 


**Answer:** 10%

"Jenny bought bananas in bunches, which is cheaper!  Here's how:

* She bought 10 bunches of bananas.
* Each bunch has 4 bananas.
* So, she has 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.
* If she bought them individually, it would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00
* But she bought them in bunches for $3.00 per bunch, so she saved $32.00 - $3.00 = $2.00!

"If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, how much is left for Sam?

Here's how to solve it:

* Let's say Sam has 'x' feet of fence.
* Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.
* Together, they have 100 feet of fence. 

So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Let's solve for x:
* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Sam has 20 feet of fence.

Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.

Sam has 100 - 80 = 20 feet left.

"Marcel sold a lot of bikes!  He sold 300 bikes in total.  Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes.  That means he sold 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes.  The rest were MTB bikes.

To find out how much money Marcel made, we need to know how much he sold each type of bike for.  MTB bikes cost $500 each, BMX bikes cost half that, and Trekking bikes cost $450 each.

So, he sold 105 MTB bikes, 45 BMX bikes, and 150 Trekking bikes.  That's a lot of bikes!

To find out how much money he made, we need to multiply the number of each type of bike by its price.

* MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

Marcel made a lot of money selling bikes!  He made $52,500 from MTB bikes, $11,250 from BMX bikes, and $6,750 from Trekking bikes.  That's a total of $70,500!

"John takes 2 extra classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class 5 days a week.  He also spends 1/16 of his time on Saturday and Sunday learning.  How many hours does John spend learning each week?

a) 8 hours
b) 7 hours
c) 6 hours
d) 5 hours

John spends 400 minutes on his classes each week. He also spends 30 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.  That's 400 + 30 = 430 minutes.  To find out how many hours he spends learning, we need to divide the total minutes by 60.  430 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 7.16666667 hours.  So the answer is 7 hours.

"Sheila started with $85.00 on her credit card. She returned a thing that cost $15.00, so now she has $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00. 

Then, she bought a frying pan that was 20% off.  That means she got a discount of $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.  The price of the frying pan was $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off. That means she got a discount of $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The price of the towels was $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

So, she spent $16.00 on the frying pan and $27.00 on the towels.  That makes a total of $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Now, she has to pay for the $43.00.  So, her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

* The second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 pounds / 2 = 30 pounds.

Together, the dogs weigh 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

"If Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, to go half the way around the Earth, he needs to fly 20,000 kilometers.  To find out how many days it takes, we need to divide the distance he needs to fly by how far he flies each day. 

20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days 

So it will take Alfie **50 days** to fly half the way around the Earth.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.  Let's call that number 'x'.  

Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together.  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  

So, we can write this as:

*  Camden painted: x + 12
*  Sarah painted: x - 12

Together they painted 30 eggs.  So, we can write that as:

*  x + (x - 12) = 30

Now, let's solve for x:

*  2x - 12 = 30
*  2x = 42
*  x = 21

So, Arnold and Madeline painted 21 eggs each.

Camden painted 21 + 12 = 33 eggs.

Camden painted 33 - 21 = 12 more eggs than Arnold. 


**Answer:** Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.  If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?

Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Step 1:  We know Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.**  So he ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

* **Step 2:  We know it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.**  Let's think about this: 6 potatoes make 3 scoops.  So, 3 less than 6 potatoes is 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

* **Step 3:  We know Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop needs 3 potatoes.**  So, Gomer ate 18 * 3 = 54 potatoes.

**Answer:** Gomer ate 54 potatoes.

"If Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days and then eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, he eats a total of 90 eggs in the first 30 days and 150 eggs in the second 30 days.  That's a total of 240 eggs!  To figure out how many dozens of eggs he needs for 60 days, we need to divide the total eggs by the number of eggs in a dozen.  There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so Chester needs 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens. 

**Answer:** 20

"There are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans, so there are 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That's a total of 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans.  The rest of the jellybeans are blue, so there are 60 - 51 = 9 blue jellybeans. 

**Answer:** 9

"Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to know how fast he was going for the whole trip.

* **Step 1:  How fast did he go the first time?**
   He traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so he was going 55 miles per hour.

* **Step 2: How fast did he go the second time?**
   He traveled 140 miles in 3 hours, so he was going 46.67 miles per hour (that's a little over 47 miles per hour).

* **Step 3:  What's the total distance?**
   He traveled a total of 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

* **Step 4: How long did he travel?**
   He traveled for 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

* **Step 5:  What's his average speed?**
   To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

**Answer:** 50 miles per hour

"If one ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and another ticket is three times more likely to win, what is the chance that both tickets win?

a) 20%
b) 40%
c) 60%
d) 12%

The answer is **d) 12%** 

Here's how we figure that out:

* The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning.
* The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so it has a 60% chance of winning.
* To find the chance of both winning, we multiply the chances: 20% * 60% = 12%

"Okay, so we know Jim had 27 seashells.  That's 5 more than Carlos.  Carlos had twice as many as Carrey.  So, Carrey had 11 seashells.  Together they had 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  To find out how many each person got, we need to divide the total seashells by 3.  So, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"The cassette has 5 minutes of music and another song that is 60% longer.  So the second song is 60% longer than the first song.  To find the length of the second song, we need to multiply the length of the first song by 0.60.  The second song is 5 minutes * 0.60 = 3 minutes longer.  The total time is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes. 

**Answer:** 8 minutes

"Hortex needs to make more juice!  They make 4200 bottles a day, but we need 2300 people to have juice for the whole day.  That's like 2300 people needing juice.  

To know how many more bottles they need, we need to figure out how many bottles they need to make.  

* 2300 people need juice.
* Each bottle gives 20% of the juice they need.
* So, we need 2300 bottles. 


**Answer:** 2300 bottles

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* Carla has 8 babies, and she dresses 3/4 of them in purple. That means 3/4 * 8 = 6 babies are purple.
* She also dresses 1/4 of the babies in blue, so there are 1/4 * 8 = 2 blue babies.
*  We know 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows. That means 1/3 * 6 = 2 babies wear bows.
*  We also know 1/3 of the blue babies wear bows. That means 1/3 * 2 = 2/3 babies wear bows.
*  The total number of babies wearing bows is 2 (purple) + 2/3 (blue) = 8/3 babies.
*  The percentage of babies wearing purple who also wear bows is (2/6) * 100% = 33.33%.


**Answer:** 33.33%

"The IRS got 5168 tax reports last week.  They got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  To find out how many they got on Wednesday, we need to find the total number of reports they got on Monday and Tuesday plus the total number of reports they got on Thursday and Friday.  That's 1907 + 2136 = 4043.  Then we can find out how many they got on Wednesday by subtracting the total from Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports they got last week.  So, 5168 - 4043 = 1125.  

**Answer:** 1125

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt.  Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar.  Charlie found 2 less than Stacy.  And Mei found half as many as Charlie.  How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

**Answer:** 9 
 
Let's break it down:

* Lamar found 5 eggs.
* Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
* Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
*  In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
*  So, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left hidden.

"Here's how the avocado tree grows:

* **Year 1-5:** The tree starts small, making 50 fruits each year. That's 5 years of 50 fruits each year, so it makes 5 * 50 = 250 fruits.
* **Year 6:** The tree gets bigger and makes 3 times as many fruits as it did in year 1. So it makes 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:** The tree gets even bigger and makes 7 times as many fruits as it did in year 1. So it makes 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:** The tree makes 150 fruits, which is 200 less than the tree in year 7.
* **Year 9:** The tree doesn't make any fruits.
* **Year 10:** The tree is big now and makes 20 times as many fruits as it did in year 1. So it makes 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.

**Total fruits:** 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits

"The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters, what was the length of the red rope?

Here's how to solve it:

* We know the yellow rope is the longest, and the blue rope is shorter than the yellow rope.
* We can use the information to figure out the lengths of the other ropes. 

Let's use the information to find the length of the yellow rope:

* The yellow rope is the longest, so we can call it 'x'.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7'.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)'.

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the ropes:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'x':

* x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Ronnie had $5. Rissa had three times that amount, so she had $15.  

Rissa gave some money to her sister, and now she has 4/5 of her money left.  This means she gave away 1/5 of her money. 

To find out how much she gave away, we can think about it like this:

* Rissa had $15.
* She gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 * (1/5) = $3.

So, Rissa had $15 - $3 = $12 left.

Ronnie gave $3 to her sister. 

Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Tom has 4 bedrooms. Each bedroom is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  What is the total area of the house?

* A. 2160 square feet
* B. 3160 square feet
* C. 1000 square feet 

The total area of the bedrooms is 4 bedrooms * 20 feet * 12 feet = 960 square feet. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the living room is 20 feet * 12 feet * 5 = 1200 square feet. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. The total area of the house is 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Thomas starts with 50 dollars. He takes out 10 dollars, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 dollars left. He uses half of the money, which is 40 / 2 = 20 dollars.  He has 40 - 20 = 20 dollars left. He triples that amount, which is 20 * 3 = 60 dollars.  He then takes out all the money and puts it into 5 dollar bills.  So, he has 60 / 5 = 12 five dollar bills.

"Team A scored 4 goals in the first half. Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals. In the second half, Team B scored 4 times the number of goals they scored in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, which is 8 * (1/4) = 2 goals.  In total, Team A scored 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 goals and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is 8 + 10 = 18 goals.

"The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.  He uses 20% each day, so he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.  That means he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk left.  To figure out how many days he can use it, we need to divide the amount of chalk left by the amount he uses each day.  He can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  That's 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 of 40 trees, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  So he planted 30 White Oak trees and 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 30 + 10 = 40 trees.

In total, Mr. Julius planted 60 + 40 = 100 trees in two days.

"If eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40, we need to find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher's lounge.

Let's think about it like this:

*  Four times the number of coffee mugs is like saying ""4 times the number of mugs"".
*  Eight more than that means we add 8 to the number of mugs.

So, we can write this as an equation: 4 times the number of mugs + 8 = 40

Let's solve for the number of mugs:

*  We need to find out what number, when multiplied by 4, plus 8, equals 40.

Let's think about it like this:

*  If we multiply 4 by a number, we get 4 times that number.
*  So, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by 4, gives us 40.

We can do this by thinking about what number, when multiplied by 4, will give us 40. 

*  If we think about numbers that are close to 40, we can see that 8 is 4 times 2. 
*  So, we can try 8. 

Let's check: 4 times 8 is 32, and 32 plus 8 is 40. 

So, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. 


**Answer: 8**

"Here's how we can figure out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes:

* **Red stripes:**  We know one-third of the fish have red stripes.  That's like taking a part of the whole group and putting it into groups.  So, we have 66 fish / 3 = 22 fish with red stripes.
* **Blue stripes:**  The rest of the fish don't have red stripes.  We know that 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish are left.  Then, 44 fish / 11 = 4 fish have blue stripes.
* **Total:**  We have 22 fish with red stripes and 4 fish with blue stripes.  So, 22 + 4 = 26 fish have red stripes and blue stripes.

"The dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.  

* **Low setting:** This setting takes away 1 liter of water each day.
* **Medium setting:** This setting takes away twice as much water as the low setting, so it takes away 2 liters each day.
* **High setting:** This setting takes away twice as much water as the medium setting, so it takes away 4 liters each day.

Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then 3 days on the medium setting, and then 5 days on the high setting.  

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

The total amount of water the dehumidifier took away is 3 + 6 + 20 = 30 liters.

"Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If Samantha has 27 paintings, how many paintings does Kim have?

*  Kim has 31 paintings. 
 
Let's think about it like this:

* Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.
* Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. 
* We know Samantha has 27 paintings. 

Let's use a little math to find out how many paintings Kim has. 
 
Let's say Kim has 'x' paintings. 
 
Shelley has 'x + 8' paintings. 
 
Samantha has 'x - 12' paintings. 
 
We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write an equation: 
 
x - 12 = 27 
 
Let's solve for 'x':
 
x = 27 + 12
 
x = 39

So, to find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

"Mark's car broke down, and he needed a new radiator.  The radiator cost $400.  He got it at a special shop and it was 80% off!  That means he only paid $320 for the radiator.  Then, a mechanic had to put it in.  It took him 3 hours to do it, and he charged $50 an hour.  So, he paid $150 for the mechanic.  Mark paid $320 for the radiator and $150 for the mechanic, so he paid a total of $470. 

**Answer:** 470

"Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, and they all are either chickens or cows.  The animals have a total of 70 legs.  How many of the animals are chickens?

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Let's use letters to represent the number of chickens and cows:**
   *  Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
   *  Let 'w' be the number of cows.

* **We know that the total number of animals is 20:**
   *  c + w = 20

* **We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs:**
   *  2c + 4w = 70

Now we can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens). 

**Here's how:**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   *  To find 'w', we can subtract 'c' from both sides of the first equation:
   *  w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute 'w' into the second equation:**
   *  Now we can plug in the value of 'w' that we just found:
   *  2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   *  2c + 80 - 4c = 70

"If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, we need to figure out how many slices we have in total.  So, we have 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.  Then, we have 4 people sharing the pizza.  So, each person gets 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices. 

**Answer:** 14
