"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations to represent the relationships between the sheep populations:

*  Let 'S' represent the number of sheep in Seattle.
*  Let 'C' represent the number of sheep in Charleston.
*  Let 'T' represent the number of sheep in Toulouse.

We are given the following information:

*  C = 4S  (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
*  T = 2C  (Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston)

We are also given that Seattle has 20 sheep (S = 20).

Substituting the value of C from the first equation into the second equation:

T = 2 * (4 * 20) = 160

Now, we can find the total number of sheep:

Total sheep = S + C + T = 20 + 4 * 20 + 160 = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is **260**.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations to represent the relationships between the number of pets each person has.

* Let 'C' represent the number of pets Cindy has.
* Let 'M' represent the number of pets Marcia has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of pets Jan has.

We know the following:

* M = C + 2  (Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy)
* J = 3M  (Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

* J = 3(C + 2) 
* J = 3C + 6

We also know that C = 4 (Cindy has 4 pets).  Substituting this into the equation for J:

* J = 3(4) + 6

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let's represent the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees with the variables q, b, and w, respectively. 

We know the following:

* **q:** The number of queens.
* **b:** The number of baby bees.
* **w:** The number of worker bees.

We are given the following relationships:

* **w = 2b:** The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees.
* **b = 2q:** The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

We can use these relationships to express the total number of bees in terms of the number of queens.

**Total Bees = q + b + w**

Substituting the given relationships:

**700 = q + 2q + 2(2q)**

Simplifying the equation:

**700 = q + 2q + 4q**
**700 = 7q**
**q = 100**

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:

**w = 2b**
**w = 2 * (2q)**
**w = 2 * (2 * 100)**
**w = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees.

"The price of the bag of marbles increases by a geometric progression.  The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.  

To calculate the final price after 36 months, we can use the formula for the geometric progression:

* **P(n) = P(0) * (1 + r)^n**

Where:

* P(n) is the price after n months
* P(0) is the initial price
* r is the growth rate (0.20 in this case)
* n is the number of months

In this case, P(0) = $20, r = 0.20, and n = 36.  

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(36) = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^36

Calculating this gives us:

P(36) = $20 * (1.20)^36

* **Define variables:**
    * Let J represent Jan's current age.
    * Let M represent Mark's current age.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  J = M + 2 (Jean is two years older than Mark)
    *  M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age)

* **Solve for J (Jan's age):**
    * Substitute the value of J from the first equation into the second equation:
       M - 2 = (M + 2 + 2) / 2 + 5
    * Simplify and solve for M:
       M - 2 = (M + 4) / 2 + 5
       2M - 4 = M + 4 + 10
       2M - 4 = M + 14

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is determined by the sum of the times of each runner.  

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 63 seconds
* Runner 3: 66 seconds
* Runner 4: 69 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds.

The faster team's time is calculated by multiplying the time of each runner by the number of runners. 

* Runner 1: 55 seconds
* Runner 2: 55 seconds
* Runner 3: 55 seconds
* Runner 4: 55 seconds

The total time for the faster team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The winning margin is calculated by subtracting the less well-rounded team's time from the faster team's time: 220 - 258 = -38 seconds.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw distributed to the rodents and the number of rats. 

* **Straw Distribution:** We know 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents.
* **Hamster Straw Usage:** 10 cages of hamsters were given 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 50 pieces.
* **Rat Straw Usage:**  The remaining straw, 160 - 50 = 110 pieces, was used for the rats.
* **Rat Calculation:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used by the straw per rat: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.
* **Rat Per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The trader's profit is the result of selling the wheat at a higher price than the cost of acquisition.  We can express this mathematically as:

* **Profit = (Selling Price per Bag * Number of Bags) - (Cost per Bag * Number of Bags) - Transportation Cost**

We are given the following information:

* **Selling Price per Bag:** $30
* **Cost per Bag:** $20
* **Transportation Cost:** $2 per bag
* **Profit:** $400

Let 'x' represent the number of bags sold.  Substituting these values into the profit equation, we get:

"The provided problem presents a logical inconsistency.  The scenario of a chicken flock where the number of red chickens directly impacts the number of white chickens is not a standard model in poultry farming.  

Here's why:

* **Egg Production:** The number of eggs produced by a flock is influenced by factors like breed, age, and overall health of the chickens.  The ratio of red to white chickens doesn't directly translate to a consistent egg production difference.
* **Chickens are not perfectly balanced:**  Chickens are not perfectly balanced in terms of egg production.  There is a natural variation in egg production between individual chickens, even within the same breed.

**Therefore, the problem as stated is not solvable within the framework of standard poultry farming principles.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 's' represent the number of snails in the first aquarium.
*  Let 'f' represent the number of fish in the first aquarium.

We are given the following information:

*  s = 4 
*  f = 14 
*  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish: s - f = 2 * f

We can now substitute the given values into the equation:

*  4 - 14 = 2 * 14

Simplifying the equation:

*  -10 = 28

This equation is not true.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

* **Large holes:** Each large hole takes 10 minutes to dig. We need to calculate the total time for 15 large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on small holes and large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total time in minutes by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. 

**Answer:** 4 hours

"
"Let's analyze the given information:

* We are given a system of two equations:
    *  R = 6S (Ruby's current age is 6 times Sam's age)
    * R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

* We can solve for S (Sam's current age) using substitution.  

* Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

* Simplifying and solving for S:
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"The flag's design is a classic example of a geometric pattern.  To determine the number of 5-star rows, we need to consider the total number of stars and the number of stars in each row. 

* **Stars in the first two rows:** 3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars
* **Stars in the third row:** 76 total stars - 24 stars = 52 stars
* **Stars in the 5-star rows:** 52 stars - 24 stars = 28 stars
* **Number of 5-star rows:** 28 stars / 5 stars/row = 5.6 rows

Since you can't have a fraction of a row, there must be **5** rows of 5 stars.

The total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  Each truck has a capacity of 2,000 pounds.  

Therefore, we can determine the number of trucks needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:

5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks

Since we cannot have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number.

"The problem presents a classic application of the relationship between distance, speed, and time.  

We can express this relationship mathematically as:

*  Distance = Speed × Time

We are given:

* Distance = 480 miles
* Speed (fast lane) = 60 miles/hour
* Speed (slow lane) = 30 miles/hour

To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we can rearrange the formula to solve for time:

* Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the given values:

* Time (slow lane) = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"To determine the number of boxes required to store the pencils, we can utilize a simple linear equation.  Let 'x' represent the number of boxes Jam needs.  We know that Jam has 24 pencils in her boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils.  Therefore, the total number of pencils can be represented as: 24x + 2 = 46.  Solving for x, we get: 24x = 46 - 2 = 44.  Dividing both sides by 24, we find that x = 44/24 = 1.83.  Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we can assume that Jam needs 2 boxes to store all the pencils.

"The phone's charging rate is a constant, meaning it charges at a fixed rate of 1% per 3 minutes.  To determine the time to fully charge, we need to determine the total charge required and then calculate the time needed to achieve that charge.

The phone needs to gain 40% of charge to reach 100%.  

The charging rate is 1% per 3 minutes.  Therefore, to gain 40% of charge, the phone needs to be charged for 40/1 = 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide 120 minutes by 60 minutes per hour: 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

"The problem can be solved by setting up an equation based on the given information.  Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.  The total number of students is then 2x.  The smallest group has x-10 students.  We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Simplifying the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Solving for x:

3x = 210
x = 70

Therefore, each of the equal groups has 70 students.  The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"The problem presents a classic system of equations to solve for the number of chickens and cows on the farm.  

Let's represent the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'.  We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
* **Equation 2:** c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

To solve for the unknowns, we can use substitution.  From Equation 2, we can express 'c' in terms of 'w': c = 2w.  

Substituting this into Equation 1: 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms: 3w = 60

Solving for 'w': w = 60 / 3 = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find 'c': c = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, to determine the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs per animal:

* Chickens have 2 legs each.
* Cows have 4 legs each.

Total legs = (Number of chickens * Legs per chicken) + (Number of cows * Legs per cow)
Total legs = (40 * 2) + (20 * 4) = 80 + 80 = 160

Therefore, the total number of legs on the farm is 160.

"To determine the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the total cost of the activities and the available budget. 

Let's break down the costs:

* **Mini-golf:**  The cost per person is $5.  
* **Go-karts:** The cost per ride is $10.

We need to find the maximum number of friends she can invite while staying within her $90 budget. 

**Let's represent the number of friends as 'x'.**

* **Mini-golf cost:** 5 * x 
* **Go-kart cost:** 10 * 2 (since she wants to ride twice) = $20
* **Total cost:** 5x + 20

**Setting up the equation:**

5x + 20 = 90

**Solving for x:**

1. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x = 70
2. Divide both sides by 5: x = 14

**Therefore, Morgan can invite 14 friends.**

"Billy's purchase can be represented as a system of equations:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of pounds of candy purchased.
*  The cost of the candy is 1.50x.
*  The cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = 2.00.
*  The change Billy received is 10.00 - 1.50x - 2.00.

We can set up the equation:

Solving for x:

1.50x = 10.00 - 9.80 + 2.00
1.50x = 3.00
x = 3.00 / 1.50
x = 2.00

Therefore, Billy bought **2.00 pounds** of candy.

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To determine his initial landholding, we can utilize the concept of proportions.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther possessed.  The proportion representing the land remaining is 12.8 hectares.  

We can express this as:

(3/5)x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we can follow these steps:

1. Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3: 
   x = (12.8 * 5) / 3

2. Calculate the result:
   x = 21.33 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 21.33 hectares of land.

"The problem presents a classic example of a conditional probability scenario.  We need to determine the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding. 

* **Understanding the Problem:**  We are given that 5% of the candles are defective, and of those defective candles, 99% are not explosive. This means the probability of a candle being defective and exploding is the intersection of these two events.

* **Calculating the Probability:**  We can use the following formula:

   P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

   Where:
   * P(A and B) is the probability of both events happening.
   * P(A) is the probability of event A (being defective).
   * P(B|A) is the probability of event B (exploding given that A has already happened).

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P(A) = 0.05 (5% of the candles are defective)
   * P(B|A) = 0.99 (99% of defective candles are not explosive)

* **Calculating the Result:**
   P(A and B) = 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495

* **Time and Distance:** The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 MPH, which translates to 0.5 hours and 16 miles.

**Analysis:**

The key issue is the inconsistency between the given information and the calculation of the hay consumption.  

**To proceed, we need to clarify the following:**

1. **Hay Consumption:** Is the horse consuming 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, or is this a variable consumption rate? 
2. **Time:** The time provided is in minutes, but the horse's speed is in MPH. 

**Once we have a clear understanding of the horse's consumption rate and the time unit, we can accurately calculate the total cost of hay and the change Michael has.**

"This problem demonstrates a classic example of a geometric series.  Each round of calls effectively multiplies the number of families contacted by a factor of 3.  

To find the total number of families contacted after *n* rounds, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (in this case, 3)
* r = the common ratio (in this case, 3)
* n = the number of rounds

In this case, we want to find the number of families contacted after the fourth round (n=4).  Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)
S = 3 (1 - 81) / (-2)
S = 3 (-80) / (-2)
S = 120

Therefore, **120 families** will be notified after the fourth round of calls.

"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently possesses, we need to consider the relationship between the size of James's play set and the desired size of Jonathan's play set. 

Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'.  We know that the desired size of Jonathan's play set is five times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys.  Therefore, the desired size of Jonathan's play set is 80 * 5 = 400 toys.

To achieve this desired size, Jonathan needs to have 2 more toys than he currently has.  This can be represented as the equation: x + 2 = 400 - 2.

Solving for x, we get: x = 400 - 2 - 2 = 396.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has **396** toys.

"The problem can be solved using a simple linear equation. Let's denote Ray's swimming speed in cold water as 'x' miles per minute.  

*  In warm water, his speed is increased by 2 minutes, so his speed is (x + 2) miles per minute.
*  The time taken to swim 3 miles in cold water is 16 minutes.
*  The time taken to swim 3 miles in warm water is (34 minutes).

To find the time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we can use the following equation:

Time = Distance / Speed

Therefore, the time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day is:

Time = 3 miles / (x + 2) miles per minute

The difference in time between the cold and hot days is:

Time (hot day) - Time (cold day) = 3 miles / (x + 2) - 16 minutes / x

To find the difference in time, we need to find the value of 'x'. 

We know that the time taken to swim 3 miles in cold water is 16 minutes. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation:

16 = 3 / (x + 2)

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 3 / (16 - 2) = 3 / 14

Now, we can substitute the value of 'x' back into the equation for the time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day:

Time (hot day) = 3 miles / (3/14 + 2) = 3 miles / (14/14 + 28/14) = 3 miles / (42/14) = 3 * 14 / 42 = 1/2

Therefore, the time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day is 1/2 hour.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'A' represent Anna's goals.
* Let 'M' represent Mark's goals.
* Let 'R' represent Richie's goals.

We know:

* R = M + 20 
* R = A + 45

We also know R = 80.  Substituting the first equation into the second equation:

80 = M + 20 + 45

Simplifying:

80 = M + 65

Solving for M:

M = 80 - 65 = 15

Now we can find A:

A = R - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35

Finally, calculate the total goals:

Total goals = A + M + R = 35 + 15 + 80 = 130

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 130.

"Let's break down this problem using a fractional representation of the jelly bean quantities.  

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  The number of red jelly beans is 0.99b, as there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue.
*  The number of green jelly beans is 1.01b, as there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three quantities:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

To determine the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01b = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99b = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"The beanstalk's growth follows a geometric sequence.  To determine the number of days it takes to reach the window, we need to find the value of *n* in the geometric sequence where the first term is 4 and the common ratio is 2. 

The general formula for a geometric sequence is: aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)

Where:
* aₙ is the nth term
* a₁ is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case, we have:

* a₁ = 4
* r = 2
* aₙ = 20 (the height of the window)

Substituting these values into the formula:

20 = 4 * 2^(n-1)

Dividing both sides by 4:

5 = 2^(n-1)

To find the value of n, we need to find the power to which 2 must be raised to get 5.  Since 2^3 = 8 and 2^4 = 16, we can see that 2^4 = 16 is the closest power to 5.

Therefore, n-1 = 4, and n = 5.

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants, the cost of the crown, and the deposit. 

The total cost of the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000. The cost of the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

The total amount George needs to pay is $4500.  He has already paid a deposit of $600.  Therefore, he needs to pay $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we can use his hourly wage. He earns $15 per hour.  Therefore, he needs to work $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.

"The angles of a triangle always satisfy the property that the sum of their measures is 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

* Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.
* The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  We are given the following:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (The total number of heads is 20)

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: 
* s = 20 - g

Substituting this value of 's' into Equation 1:
* 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'g':
* 80 - 4g + 2g = 70
* -2g = -10
* g = 5

Now, substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:
* s = 20 - 5
* s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Dora's age be represented by the variable 'd'.
* Dora's father's age is represented by 'f'.
* Dora's mother's age is represented by 'm'.

We are given the following information:

*  f = 2d + 8  (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
*  m = f - 4  (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)
* d = 15  (Dora's current age)

Now, we can substitute the values of 'f' and 'm' from the first two equations into the third equation:

* m = (2d + 8) - 4
* m = 2d + 4

We can now substitute the value of 'd' into the equation for 'm':

* m = 2(15) + 4
* m = 30 + 4
* m = 34

Finally, we can calculate the total combined age:

* Total age = d + f + m
* Total age = 15 + (2d + 8) + 34
* Total age = 15 + (2 * 15 + 8) + 34
* Total age = 15 + 30 + 8 + 34
* Total age = 87


Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We are also given that Paul is 10 years older than John.  We are asked to find Peter's age.

Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and John with the variables P, P+10, and J respectively.  

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  P + P + J = 100  (The sum of their ages is 100)
*  P = P + 10 + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

From the second equation, we can isolate J:
* J = 100 - 2P

Now, substitute this value of J into the first equation:
* P + P + (100 - 2P) = 100

Simplify and solve for P:
* 2P + 100 - 2P = 100
* 100 = 100

This equation is true for any value of P.  

Therefore, we can conclude that the given information is inconsistent.  There is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.

"To determine the total hay needed, we can break down the problem into two parts: the hay required for the goats and the hay required for the sheep.

* **Goats:** Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total hay needed from goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

* **Sheep:**  Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  This means each sheep needs 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.  The total hay needed from sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations based on the given information.  Let's represent the scores as follows:

*  Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
*  Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
*  Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

From the first two equations, we can substitute to eliminate B:

*  A + 20 = D + 10
*  A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

* **The remaining person receives 15 more than the two, so they receive x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips is the sum of the chips each person receives.**

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 265

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 15 = 265

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

3x = 250

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 83.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's consider the problem in terms of the number of people. 

* **The problem states that two people get an equal amount of corn chips, and the other person gets 15 more than the two.** This implies that the number of people is 3. 

* **The total number of corn chips is the sum of the chips each person receives.**

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

"Let's analyze the given information to determine Stan's Pokemon catch.

We are given that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can express this as a system of equations:

*  A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

To solve for Stan's catch (S), we can use the following steps:

1. **Express A in terms of S:**  From the first equation, we know A = S + 5.

2. **Substitute into the third equation:** Substitute (S + 5) for A in the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339

3. **Simplify and solve for W:** Combine like terms and solve for W: 2S + W = 339.  We can substitute the second equation (S = 4W - 13) into this equation to get: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339.

4. **Solve for W:** Simplify and solve for W: 8W - 26 + W = 339. Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339. Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365. Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get W = 41.

5. **Solve for S:** Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13. Simplify: S = 164 - 13. Therefore, S = 151.


**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries, we first need to find the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have.  

* Richard has 20 cherries.
* Robert has 30 cherries.
* Together, they have 20 + 30 = 50 cherries.

Subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the total number of cherries Richard and Robert have, we find the difference. 

* Jerry has 10 cherries.
* The difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries is 50 - 10 = 40.

Therefore, Robert has 40 more cherries than Jerry.

"Sunny's earnings can be calculated by considering the revenue generated from each type of pie sold on each day.  

* **Saturday:**  He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie.  The revenue from gingerbread is 10 boxes * $6/box = $60.  The revenue from apple pie is 6 boxes * $15/box = $90.  The total revenue for Saturday is $60 + $90 = $150.

* **Sunday:** He sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie. The revenue from gingerbread is 15 boxes * $6/box = $90. The revenue from apple pie is 15 boxes * $15/box = $225. The total revenue for Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.

To find Sunny's total earnings for the two days, we sum the revenue from Saturday and Sunday: $150 + $315 = $465.

"The problem presents a simple linear relationship between the price of the blue car and the red car.  The red car is 40% less expensive than the blue car.  

To find the price of the red car, we can use the following equation:

* Price of Red Car = (1 - 0.40) * Price of Blue Car

Substituting the known price of the blue car ($100), we get:

* Price of Red Car = (1 - 0.40) * $100 = $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is the sum of their individual prices:

* Total Cost = Price of Red Car + Price of Blue Car
* Total Cost = $60 + $100 = $160

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let Emil's current age be represented by 'e'
* Let his father's current age be represented by 'f'
* Let his brother's current age be represented by 'b'

We know the following:

*  e = 19 (Emil's current age)
*  f = 2 * e (Emil's father will be twice Emil's age when he turns 24)
*  b = e / 2 (Emil's brother will be half Emil's age when he turns 24)

We can use these equations to find the ages of Emil's father and brother.

*  f = 2 * 19 = 38
*  b = 19 / 2 = 9.5

Finally, to find the sum of their ages, we add their current ages:

*  f + b = 38 + 9.5 = 47.5

Therefore, the sum of Emil's father and brother's ages is 47.5.

"Let's analyze the given information:

* **First Plane:** The first plane operates with a fixed number of flights per day.  
* **Greece Flights:** The first plane dedicates (3/4) of its flights to Greece.
* **France/Germany Flights:** The remaining (1/4) of the flights are split equally between France and Germany.
* **Other Plane:** The other plane exclusively flies to Poland, with a total of 44 trips.

**Key Insight:** The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the number of flights and the number of trips. 

**Let's use a variable:**

* Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* Greece flights: (3/4)x
* France/Germany flights: (1/4)x
* Poland flights: 22

**Solving for x:**

* The other plane's trips represent half the total flights of the first plane. Therefore, we can express the number of trips for the other plane as (1/2) * x.
* We know the other plane makes 22 trips. 
* We can set up the equation: (1/2) * x = 22

**Solving for x:**

* Multiply both sides by 2: x = 44

**Answer:** The first plane makes 44 flights in a day. 


**Therefore, the answer is 44.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total age of the group is 20 years.
* We are given that Helene is twice the average age of the group.
* We are also given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

To find Wilfred's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is the sum of the ages of all children divided by the number of children.  
   * Average age = (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
   * Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4
   * We know the average age is 5 years.

2. **Determine Helene's age:**  We know Helene is twice the average age, so:
   * Helene's age = 2 * Average age = 2 * 5 = 10 years

3. **Calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:**  
   * Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7 years

4. **Calculate Wilfred's age:**
   * Total age of all children - Helene's age - combined age of Akbar and Alessandro = Wilfred's age
   * 20 - 10 - 7 = 3 years

**Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem using a fractional representation.  

* **Let 'x' represent the size of a child's slice.**  
* **An adult's slice is twice the size of a child's, so it's 2x.**
* **The total slices are 6, representing the 2 adults and 4 children.**

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we need to express the adult's slice as a fraction of the total watermelon. 

* **The adult's slice is 2x out of 6 total slices.** 
* **This can be expressed as (2x/6) = (x/3).**

"Jordan needs to complete the cake preparation in a time-efficient manner to ensure a timely completion.  

Let's break down the time required for each step:

* **Cake batter preparation:** 20 minutes
* **Baking:** 30 minutes
* **Cooling:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
* **Frosting:** 10 minutes

The total time required for all steps is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

"The Smith family's pool requires a volume calculation to determine the necessary water volume.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet.  The volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool:

* Volume = Length x Width x Depth
* Volume = 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet
* Volume = 1400 cubic feet

To convert cubic feet to gallons, we use the conversion factor of 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons.  Therefore:

* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
* Volume in gallons = 10392 gallons

Finally, the cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the volume in gallons by the price per gallon:

* Cost = Volume in gallons x Price per gallon
* Cost = 10392 gallons x $0.10/gallon
* Cost = $1039.20

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is **$1039.20**.

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the net present value (NPV) of his future earnings. 

The NPV of his future earnings is the present value of his future income minus the present value of his loan payments.  

* **Future earnings:**  Jim's annual income increases by a factor of 3, so his future earnings are $75,000/year.
* **Loan payments:**  Jim's loan payments are $50,000/year.
* **Time horizon:**  Jim's education lasts 4 years.

To calculate the NPV, we need to consider the time value of money.  The present value of a future sum of money is calculated using the following formula:

PV = FV / (1 + r)^n

Where:

* PV = Present Value
* FV = Future Value
* r = Interest rate

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

We know the total number of balls retrieved is 19.  Let's represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  

* The first set has 4 more balls than the second set, so we can express this as:  x + 4.
* The third set has half the number of balls as the second set, so we can express this as: x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of these three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combining like terms, we get: (5/2)x + 4 = 19

To solve for 'x', we can isolate it:

* Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

* **Becky ate x + 3 slices.**
* **Silvia ate 2x slices.**

We know the total number of slices is 4, and each pizza has 8 slices.  Therefore:

* **x + (x + 3) + 2x = 4 * 8**

Simplifying the equation:

* **4x + 3 = 32**
* **4x = 29**
* **x = 7.25**

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem statement.  Let's assume Jake ate 7 slices.

* **Jake ate 7 slices.**
* **Becky ate 7 + 3 = 10 slices.**
* **Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.**

The total number of slices eaten is 7 + 10 + 14 = **31 slices.**

"Let's analyze the given information:

*  Betsy and Donovan collaborated on a meal preparation.
*  The time taken by Betsy was 18 minutes longer than Donovan's time.
*  The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.

To determine the duration of Betsy's portion, we can utilize the following algebraic equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the time Donovan spent on the meal preparation.
*  Betsy's time is then 'x + 18'.
*  The total time is the sum of their individual times: x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

*  2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

*  2x = 80
*  x = 40

Therefore, Donovan spent 40 minutes on the meal preparation.

*  Betsy's time is 'x + 18', so it was 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. This translates to: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56. This translates to: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

Solving for 'y' in the second equation:
* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

Substituting the value of 'y' from the second equation into the third equation:
* 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
* 56 = 56

This equation is true for any value of 'x'.  

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we need to find a value for 'x' that satisfies the first equation. 

Let's try a value of 'x' that makes the first equation true. 

* If x = 11, then 2(11) + (2y + 12) = 56
* 22 + 2y + 12 = 56
* 2y = 22
* y = 11

Therefore, Arnold and Madeline painted 11 eggs each. 

Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 11 + 12 = 23 eggs.

The difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 23 - 11 = 12.


**Answer:** Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Beach walking:** Grandma walks 2 miles at a speed of 3 miles per day / 2 miles = 1.5 miles per hour.
* **Sidewalk walking:** She walks 1 mile at twice the speed of the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles per hour * 2 = 3 miles per hour.
* **Total time:**  The total time for the entire walk is 3 miles + 1 mile = 4 miles.
* **Time on the beach:**  The time spent on the beach is 4 miles / 1.5 miles per hour = 2.67 hours.
* **Time on the sidewalk:** The time spent on the sidewalk is 4 miles / 3 miles per hour = 1.33 hours.
* **Total time:** The total time for the entire walk is 2.67 hours + 1.33 hours = 4 hours.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Scoops:** Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
* **Potatoes per Scoop:**  We need to determine the number of potatoes required for 1 scoop.  
* **Relationship:** The problem states that 3 less than 6 potatoes is needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops.  

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent:

*  *x* = the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop.

We can set up the following equation:

* 6 - 3 = 1 - *x* 

Solving for *x*, we get:

* 3 = 1 - *x*
* *x* = 1 - 3
* *x* = -2

This result is not possible as the number of potatoes cannot be negative.  

**Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.**

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break down the problem into two phases:

* **Phase 1:**  Chester consumes 3 eggs/day for 30 days, resulting in 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.
* **Phase 2:**  He then increases to 5 eggs/day for another 30 days, consuming 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

To find the total number of dozens consumed, we need to consider the total number of eggs consumed across both phases.  

* Total eggs consumed: 90 + 150 = 240 eggs
* Number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester needs **20** dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To determine the number of days required to complete the project, we can utilize a combination of the following concepts:

* **Work Rate:**  Lauren's work rate is determined by the number of scenes she can produce per day.
* **Total Work:** The total number of scenes to be created is 45 (large) + 36 (medium) + 49 (small) = 120 scenes.
* **Work Units:**  We can express the work units as a function of the number of days.

**Solution:**

The number of days required to complete the project is the total work divided by Lauren's work rate per day.

* **Large:** 45 scenes / 5 scenes/day = 9 days
* **Medium:** 36 scenes / 6 scenes/day = 6 days
* **Small:** 49 scenes / 7 scenes/day = 7 days

**Total Days:** 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days

"To determine the number of seashells each person receives, we can utilize a system of equations. Let's represent the number of seashells Carlos collected as 'C', Jim's seashells as 'J', and Carrey's seashells as 'K'.  

We know:

* J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
* C = 2K (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

* J = (2K) + 5

Now, we can express the total number of seashells as:

* Total = C + J + K = 22 + (2K) + K + 27 = 49 + 3K

Since they divided the total seashells equally, each person receives:

* Seashells/person = (Total) / 3 = (49 + 3K) / 3

To find the number of seashells each person receives, we need to solve for K.  We can do this by substituting the value of J from the first equation into the equation for the total number of seashells. 

* J = (2K) + 5
* 27 = (2K) + 5
* 22 = 2K
* K = 11

Now, we can substitute the value of K back into the equation for the number of seashells each person receives:

* Seashells/person = (49 + 3K) / 3 = (49 + 3 * 11) / 3 = (49 + 33) / 3 = 82 / 3 = 27.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, we can assume that the total number of seashells is rounded to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, each person receives **20** seashells.

"The probability of a baby wearing a bow given that they are wearing purple can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem. 

Let:

*  *A* be the event that a baby wears a bow.
*  *B* be the event that a baby wears purple.

We want to find *P(A|B)*, the probability of a baby wearing a bow given that they are wearing purple.

Bayes' Theorem states:

*P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)*

Let's break down the components:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of a baby wearing a bow given they are wearing purple. This is equal to 1/3, as 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows.
* **P(A):** The probability of a baby wearing a bow. This is 2/6, as 2 out of 6 babies wear bows.
* **P(B):** The probability of a baby wearing purple. This is 3/4, as 3 out of 4 babies wear purple.

Therefore:

*P(A|B) = (1/3 * 2/6) / (3/4)*

Simplifying:

*P(A|B) = (2/18) / (3/4)*

*P(A|B) = 8/54*

*P(A|B) = 4/27*

**Answer:** 4/27

"Alice's cloud counting follows a geometric sequence.  The number of clouds she sees each day is double the previous day's count.  To find the total number of clouds, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (3 puffs on Monday)
* r = the common ratio (2, as the number of clouds doubles each day)
* n = the number of terms (5 days)

Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by 'C'.**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'W'.**

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""**  This translates to the equation: W = 5(C + 7)
2. **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""** This translates to the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, we can solve for our two unknowns.  

**Solving the system of equations:**

* **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

* **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
   * (2/3)C = -5
   * C = -15/2

"To determine the time it takes Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds and melts snowballs. 

* **Building Rate:** Jay builds 1/3 snowball per minute.
* **Melting Rate:** He melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes.

We can model this as a system of equations:

*  Let 't' represent the time in minutes.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of snowballs.

We can set up the following equation:

S = (1/3)t  

We also know that he melts snowballs, so we need to account for that:

S = S - (2/15) * t

We can now solve for 't' by setting the two equations equal to each other:

(1/3)t = S - (2/15) * t

Solving for 't' we get:

(1/3)t + (2/15) * t = S

Combining like terms:

(5/15) * t = S

Simplifying:

(1/3) * t = S

Now, we can substitute the value of S back into the equation:

(1/3) * t = 60

Solving for 't':

t = 60 * 3

t = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take Jay **180 minutes** to have 60 snowballs.

"The problem can be approached by considering the volume of the jar and the volume of the jelly beans.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the jelly beans.  The volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches, and the packing efficiency is 80%.  This means that the volume of the jelly beans is 80% of the volume of the jar.  

Next, we need to determine the number of jelly beans.  The volume of the jelly beans is 432 cubic inches, and the volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.  Therefore, the number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

Finally, we need to determine the difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of jelly beans.  The actual number of jelly beans is 900, and Tim's estimate is 2880.  The difference is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

"The problem presents a classic word problem that can be solved using algebraic representation.  Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.  The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up the equation: x + 4x = 40.  Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.  Therefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of seasoning needed, we can use a direct proportion.  Since Aiden produces 16 meatballs per pound of beef, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of seasoning needed.
*  We know 2 tablespoons of seasoning are used for every pound of beef.

The proportion is: 
  * 2 tablespoons/pound = 16 meatballs/pound

To find 'x', we can use the following equation:

*  x = (16 meatballs/pound) * (5 pounds) 
*  x = 80 meatballs

Therefore, Aiden needs **80** tablespoons of seasoning.

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes she makes in terms of brownies.  This translates to the following equation:

*  b = 3c - 2

We also know that the total number of treats for the class is 10.  

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

*  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley's number of paintings can be represented as 'x + 8'.
*  Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, meaning Samantha has 'x + 8 - 12' paintings, which simplifies to 'x - 4'.
*  We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation: x - 4 = 27

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 27 + 4
x = 31

Therefore, Kim has **31** paintings.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To find the total number of novels she has written this year, we can express this as a proportion.  Let 'x' represent the number of novels she has written this year.  We know that 3/4 of her novels this year is equal to 9.  Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

(3/4) * x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = (9 * 4) / 3

Simplifying the equation:

x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written **12** novels this year.

* Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* The number of blueberry cubes is then 5x - 4.
* The total number of ice cubes is x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

* 6x = 120
* x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

The number of blueberry cubes is then:

* 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

"The cost of the main phone is represented by the variable 'x'.  The cost of each additional phone is represented by 'y'.  We know that the total cost of the plan is $20.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

* x = 2y 
* 5x + 4y = 20

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for 'y':

* 5(2y) + 4y = 20
* 10y + 4y = 20
* 14y = 20
* y = 20/14
* y = 1.43 (approximately)

Now, we can substitute the value of 'y' back into the first equation to solve for 'x':

* x = 2 * 1.43
* x = 2.86 (approximately)

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is 2.86 + 1.43 * 4 = 2.86 + 5.72 = **8.58**

To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to find the number of beakers he had initially.  We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29.  

Solving for the number of beakers:

* 24 + beakers = 29
* beakers = 29 - 24
* beakers = 5

Therefore, Igor lost **5** beakers.

"Let's break down the problem using a ratio-based approach.  

* **Relative Speeds:**  We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's. This means that for every mile Vanessa runs, Aaron runs half a mile.
* **Distance and Time:**  Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran 2 miles.  We can express this relationship as a ratio: Vanessa's distance to Aaron's distance is 4:2.
* **Time Relationship:**  Since the time taken is directly proportional to the distance covered, we can use the ratio to find Vanessa's time. 

**Therefore, Vanessa took 4 minutes to complete her part of the race.**

"The vendor made a 25% markup on the cost of the watermelons.  To find the selling price per watermelon, we can use the following equation:

**Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)**

Let's plug in the values:

* Cost Price = $80
* Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25 (converting percentage to decimal)

**Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80) = $80 + $20 = $100**

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for **$100**.

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Substituting the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
