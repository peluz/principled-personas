"Let's break down the problem:

* **Seattle:** Seattle has 20 sheep.
* **Charleston:** Charleston has 4 times the sheep of Seattle, so it has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse:** Toulouse has twice the sheep of Charleston, meaning it has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 3 hours**
   *  We know John drives at 60 mph for 3 hours.
   *  Distance = Speed x Time
   *  Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

* **Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second 4 hours**
   *  John drives for 4 hours at 80 mph.
   *  Distance = Speed x Time
   *  Distance = 80 mph * 4 hours = 320 miles

* **Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in traffic**
   *  John spends 2 hours in traffic at a speed of 30 mph.
   *  Distance = Speed x Time
   *  Distance = 30 mph * 2 hours = 60 miles

* **Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled**
   *  Total distance = 180 miles + 320 miles + 60 miles = 560 miles

* **Step 5: Calculate the distance from home**
   *  We need to find the distance from home after the 4 hours of driving. 
   *  The problem doesn't give us the distance from home, so we can't calculate the distance from home.

"To find the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount.  

We know the book was discounted by 25%, which means the sale price is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

Let 'x' represent the original price. We can set up an equation:

0.75x = $19.50

Now, solve for x:

x = $19.50 / 0.75 
x = $26.00

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.
* We're given their total age is 162.  

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we need to figure out how much Allen's age will increase.

**Here's how to solve it:**

1. **Find the individual ages:**
   * Let Darrell's current age be represented by 7x
   * Let Allen's current age be represented by 11x
   * We know their total age is 162: 7x + 11x = 162

2. **Solve for x:**
   * 18x = 162
   * x = 162 / 18
   * x = 9

3. **Calculate Allen's age in 10 years:**
   * Allen's current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99
   * Allen's age in 10 years will be 99 + 10 = 109

**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Let's break this down:

* We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total.
*  The number of gold coins is 30 more than the silver coins.

To find out how many gold coins she has, we need to figure out how many silver coins she has first. 

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can say:

* Gold coins = x + 30

We know the total number of coins is 110, so:

* x + (x + 30) = 110

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 2x + 30 = 110
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

This means Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than silver coins, Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins. 


**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

* **Gerald's improved time:** Gerald's improved time is now 'x + 0.1x' (10% improvement on his original time).
* **We know Lee's time:** We know Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:
   x + 2 = 38
* **Solve for x:** Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Calculate Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"The problem states that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats.  We know there are 60 dogs.  To find the number of cats, we can use the ratio: 2 cats per dog.  So, there are 2 * 60 = 120 cats.  

To find the number of rabbits, we can use the information that there are 12 fewer rabbits than the total number of dogs and cats.  This means there are 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 pets.

He watched 7 hours total, and we know he watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday.  This leaves 2.5 hours of TV time on Wednesday.  

To figure out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we need to divide the time he watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Henry baked 110 cookies in total.
* He baked 2 times the amount he did last year, which means he baked 2x cookies.
* He also baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
* He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.

To find out how many cookies he baked last year, we need to figure out what value of 'x' makes the equation true. 

Let's set up an equation:

"Let's break down the problem:

We know Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13 to make her coffee.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar she uses, she uses 13 cups of water.

We're given that she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find out how many cups of water she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the ratio represent the sugar.

*  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can set up a proportion: 7x = 120 teaspoons
*  Solving for x, we get x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

This means Katy used 17.14 parts of the ratio for the sugar.  

To find out how many cups of water she used, we can use the fact that the ratio is 7:13.  Since she used 17.14 parts of the sugar, she used 13 * 17.14 = 222.82 cups of water.

* **Bicycles:** 5 people * 2 tires/person * $0.25/tire = $2.50
* **Tricycles:** 3 people * 3 tires/person * $0.25/tire = $2.25
* **Unicycle:** 1 person * 1 tire * $0.25/tire = $0.25

**Total earnings:** $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, so he ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. **Pigeons' feast:** Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

3. **Remaining fries:** After the pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.

4. **Raccoon's grab:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.

5. **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Therefore, there were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months.  To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price after each two-month period and add them up.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Month 0:** $20
* **Month 2:** $20 + (0.20 * $20) = $24
* **Month 4:** $24 + (0.20 * $24) = $28.80
* **Month 6:** $28.80 + (0.20 * $28.80) = $34.56
* **Month 8:** $34.56 + (0.20 * $34.56) = $41.23
* **Month 10:** $41.23 + (0.20 * $41.23) = $48.46
* **Month 12:** $48.46 + (0.20 * $48.46) = $57.33
* **Month 14:** $57.33 + (0.20 * $57.33) = $67.06
* **Month 16:** $67.06 + (0.20 * $67.06) = $76.81
* **Month 18:** $76.81 + (0.20 * $76.81) = $88.64
* **Month 20:** $88.64 + (0.20 * $88.64) = $101.29
* **Month 22:** $101.29 + (0.20 * $101.29) = $112.58
* **Month 24:** $112.58 + (0.20 * $112.58) = $125.17
* **Month 26:** $125.17 + (0.20 * $125.17) = $140.34

"Let's break down the problem:

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:**
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age (B), we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**


**Final answer: 17.34**

* **Bo's crabs:** Bo has 40 crabs.
* **Monic's crabs:** Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so she has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* **Rani's crabs:** Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so she has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.
* **Total crabs:** To find the total, add the number of crabs each person has: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"The winner received 3/4 of the votes, which means the loser received 1/4 of the votes.  To find the number of votes the loser got, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of votes the loser got.
*  We know the total votes were 80, and the winner got 3/4 of them.

The proportion is: 3/4 = x/80

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

* 3 * 80 = 4 * x
* 240 = 4x
* x = 240 / 4
* x = 60

Therefore, the loser got **60** votes.

"Here's how to figure out the probability:

* **Think about the possibilities:**  There are 6 sides on a die, so there are 6 possible outcomes.
* **Favorable outcomes:**  We want to know the probability of getting a number greater than 3.  There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6).
* **Probability:** The probability of getting a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.
* **What about two even numbers in a row?**  There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6).  The probability of getting an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  The probability of getting another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  So, the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.
* **The difference:**  The probability of getting a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of getting two even numbers in a row is 25%.  The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.


**Answer:** It is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

"To figure out how many rats are in each cage, we need to figure out how many rats are in total. 

* We know that 160 pieces of straw were used in total.
* We also know that 50 pieces of straw were used for the hamsters.
* This leaves 110 pieces of straw for the rats.

To find out how many rats there are, we can divide the total straw used by the number of pieces of straw each rat gets:

110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 18 rats in total.**

"The trader bought the wheat for $20 per bag and had to pay $2 to transport each bag.  He made a profit of $400 after selling the bags for $30 each.  To figure out how many bags he sold, we need to figure out how much he spent on the wheat and how much he made.

* **Cost of wheat:**  The trader bought the wheat for $20 per bag, and we don't know how many bags he bought. Let's call the number of bags he bought 'x'. So, the cost of the wheat is 20x.
* **Transportation cost:** The trader had to pay $2 to transport each bag, and he had to transport 'x' bags. So, the total transportation cost is 2x.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the wheat and transportation is 20x + 2x = 22x.
* **Total revenue:** The trader sold the wheat for $30 per bag, and he sold 'x' bags. So, the total revenue is 30x.
* **Profit:** The trader made a profit of $400, which is the difference between his total revenue and total cost. So, 400 = 30x - 22x.

Solving for x, we get:
* 400 = 8x
* x = 400 / 8
* x = 50

**Answer:** The trader sold 50 bags.

"To figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, let's break it down:

* **Earnings from babysitting:** Sara earns $5 per babysitting session, and she babysits 4 times, so she makes $5 * 4 = $20.
* **Earnings from lawn mowing:** Her parents pay her $4 per lawn mowing.
* **Total earnings:**  She earns $20 from babysitting and $4 from mowing the lawn each time.  This means she earns $20 + $4 = $24 per lawn mowing.
* **Total money needed:** The jacket costs $30 and the shoes cost $20 each, totaling $30 + (2 * $20) = $70.
* **Money needed after savings:** Sara needs to earn $70 and already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.
* **Lawn mowings needed:**  She earns $24 per lawn mowing, so she needs to mow $60 / $24 = 2.5 times.

"Let's break down this problem:

We know Jerry has a total of 42 eggs collected each day.  

* Red chickens lay 3 eggs per day.
* White chickens lay 5 eggs per day.

We also know there are two more white chickens than red chickens.  

Let's use variables to represent the number of red and white chickens:

*  Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We can set up two equations based on the information given:

* Equation 1: 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs)
* Equation 2: r = w + 2 (number of white chickens is two more than red)

To solve for 'r', we can use substitution.  Since we know 'r' is equal to 'w + 2', we can substitute that into Equation 1:

3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

Now, let's solve for 'w':

* 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* 8w + 6 = 42
* 8w = 36
* w = 4.5

Since we can't have half a chicken, there's likely an error in the problem.  It's impossible to have a fractional number of chickens.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
   *  Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
   *  The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   *  Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   *  The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   *  The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   *  The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons. We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
   *  8x = 4(x - 16)
   *  8x = 4x - 64
   *  4x = -64
   *  x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.
* The difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

To find the number of fish, we can use the following steps:

1. **Find the difference in snails:** 32 - 4 = 28 snails
2. **Set up an equation:**  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish, so we can write this as: 28 = 2 * x 
3. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 2: 28 / 2 = x
4. **Calculate x:** x = 14

**Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night.
* Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
* Today, he also killed three fewer cougars than last night.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to figure out how many wolves and cougars he killed today.

* **Cougars today:**  We know he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 15 cougars last night. So, he killed 3 * 15 cougars = 45 cougars today.
* **Wolves today:**  He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so he killed 3 * 45 wolves = 135 wolves today.
* **Total animals killed today:**  He killed 135 wolves + 45 cougars = 180 animals today.
* **Total animals killed last night:**  He killed 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals last night.
* **Total animals killed:**  He killed 180 animals today + 25 animals last night = 205 animals in total.

"Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.  This means we can represent Ruby's age as 6 times Sam's age.  We can write this as an equation:

* R = 6S 

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This means:

* R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Let's solve for S:

* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

* We know the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles at 60 miles per hour.
* The car in the slow lane traveled at half the speed, so it traveled at 30 miles per hour.

Let's plug in the values into the formula:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * time

To find the time, we need to isolate 'time'.  

* Divide both sides of the equation by 30 miles/hour: 
   480 miles / 30 miles/hour = time

* This simplifies to: 16 hours.

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week.  To find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can set up a proportion.  

Let 'x' be the number of weeks Sandy needs.  We know that Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week.  So, we can set up the proportion:

"Theo has $6000 to spend on his trip to South Africa. He buys 6 suits at $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, and a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit.  He wants to save $2000 for the trip.  How much money does he have left to spend on gifts for his business partners?

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

* **Cost of suits:** 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
* **Cost of suitcases:** 3 suitcases * $50/suit = $150
* **Cost of the flight ticket:** 5 * $100 = $500
* **Flight ticket cost + $700:** $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total spending on suits, suitcases, and flight:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350
* **Total money left:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650
* **Money for gifts:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

"Let's break this down:

* We know the total number of players is 105.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so let's call the number of defense players 'x'.
* The offense has 2x players.
* Special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so they have x/2 players.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we need to get all the 'x' terms on one side:

(7/2)x = 105

To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 2/7:

x = 105 * (2/7)

x = 30

**Answer:** There are **30** players on the defense.

"The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  This means the distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it does this 3 times a day.  So, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  To find out how many days it takes to travel that distance, we divide the total distance by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"Let's solve this problem!

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and is left with 12.8 hectares.  To find out how much land he had originally, we can use a simple proportion.

* Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

* He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.

* He has 12.8 hectares left, so (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

* Simplify the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

* To find x, we can multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)

* Calculate: x = 32 hectares

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Joanne's apples:**  Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Sister's apples:**  Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:**  Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:**  We know that the total number of apples is 500, so we can set up an equation: 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500. 
* **Solve for x:**  Combining like terms, we get 130 + x = 500.  Subtracting 130 from both sides, we get x = 370.

"Let's break down this problem. We know the total number of heads is 180, and we also know the total number of bumps is 304.  

We need to figure out how many camels and dromedaries there are.  

* **Let 'c' represent the number of camels.**
* **Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.**

We can set up two equations based on the information given:

1. **Heads:** c + d = 180 
2. **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

**Solving for one variable:**

We can solve the first equation for 'c':
* c = 180 - d

**Substituting into the second equation:**

Now, let's substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

**Simplifying and solving for 'd':**

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

**Answer:** There are **56** dromedaries.

2. **Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.  The window is open for 30/10 = 3 times.  The house cools down by 3 * 2 = 6 degrees.

3. **Final temperature:** The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees and then cools down by 6 degrees, so the final temperature is 40 + 900 - 6 = 934 degrees.

**Final answer: 934**

"Here's how to figure out James's run time:

* **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 70 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 160 minutes
* **Jon won by 10 minutes:** This means James finished in 160 - 10 = 150 minutes. 
* **James's swim time:**  Jon swam 40 minutes, and James is 10% faster, so James swam 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* **James's bike time:** James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so he took 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.
* **James's run time:**  We know James's total time is 150 minutes, and we know his swim and bike times.  We can find his run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. 150 - 44 - 75 = 31 minutes.

"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.  To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we need to figure out what fraction of the 1959 penny's weight is equal to the 2010 penny.  Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can set up a proportion:

* 2010 penny weight / 1959 penny weight = 3/4

We know the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, so we can plug that in:

* 2010 penny weight / 48 grains = 3/4

To solve for the 2010 penny weight, we can cross-multiply:

* 2010 penny weight * 4 = 48 grains * 3

Simplifying:

* 2010 penny weight * 4 = 144 grains

Now that we know the weight of the 2010 penny, we can find the combined weight:

* 2010 penny weight + 1959 penny weight = 144 grains + 48 grains = 192 grains

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**

"The food truck's profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of ingredients from the total revenue. 

* **Cost of ingredients:** 
    * Bread: $3.00 per loaf, and they make 10 sandwiches per loaf.
    * Cheese and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
    * Total cost per sandwich: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30
* **Revenue:** 
    * Each sandwich sells for $7.00.
    * They sell 10 sandwiches.
    * Total revenue: $7.00 * 10 = $70.00
* **Profit:**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with the given information:** Diane begins with a value of 20.
* **Half the starting value:**  We divide 20 by 2, which equals 10.
* **Add the half value to the starting value:**  This gives us 20 + 10 = 30.
* **Divide the sum by 5:**  30 divided by 5 equals 6.

"Let's break down this problem:

* **Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**  This is our starting point.
* **The problem tells us there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue.**  This means the number of red jelly beans is 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.
* **And there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue.** This means the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

**To find the number of jelly beans, we can set up an equation:**

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

**Now, let's solve for 'b':**

1. Combine the 'b' terms: 2.99b = 4500
2. Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**To find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we can use the values we found:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

**Answer:** The jar has 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Let's solve this problem.  We know that Jerry's age is represented by the variable 'x'.  

We're told that Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  This can be written as an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Now, let's solve for 'x':

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000.  One of the implants will need a crown, which costs an extra $500.  He's already paid a deposit of $600.  To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and then figure out how much more money he needs.

The total cost of the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.  The crown adds $500 to the cost, so the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.  He needs to raise $4500 - $600 = $3900 more.

To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to raise by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.


**Answer:** George needs to work 260 hours.

"Let's figure out the largest angle!

We know that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles:

*  Let 'x' be the measure of the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

So, we can set up an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the two streets. 

* Monica's street is 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter to repave. 
* Lewis' street is 490 meters long and costs $194 per meter.

To find the difference in cost, we can subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second. To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to consider that there are 1000 kilobits in 1 megabit. 

So, her speed is 20 kilobits/second * 1000 = 20000 bits/second.

Now, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.  Therefore, her speed is 20000 bits/second * 60 minutes/hour = 1200000 bits/hour.

To convert bits per hour to megabits per hour, we divide by 1000.  So, her speed is 1200000 bits/hour / 1000 = **1.2 megabits per hour**.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the total number of legs is 70, so: 4s + 2g = 70 

We also know the total number of heads is 20, so: s + g = 20

Now we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  Here's one way to do it:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

"Let's break down the problem:

* **We know Tanya uses a 10-ounce jar.** This is our starting point.
* **She uses the same amount of zest as fragrance.**  This means the amounts of zest and fragrance are equal.
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest.** This means the amount of salt is double the amount of zest.
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt.** This means the amount of oil is double the amount of salt.

**Let's use variables to represent the amounts:**

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
*  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
*  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
*  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

**Now, let's translate the information into equations:**

*  x = fragrance 
*  y = 2x  (Salt is twice the amount of zest)
*  o = 2y  (Oil is twice the amount of salt)

"John spent a total of $4500 at the market. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* He bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500
* He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 * $1500 = $3000
* To find the total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Joe's cars:** Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. So Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.
* **Cars given to mother:** Joe gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Cars remaining:** Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.

"Let's figure out how many cards Becca has!

* Let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has:
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    *  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* We know the total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

*  Combine like terms:
    * 7x + 12 = 341

*  Solve for x:
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47

*  Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:
    * Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Milly will lose $21.00. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Shipping cost:** The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.  The book needs to be shipped 20 miles, so the mileage cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.  The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.
* **Refund amount:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.  So, the refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.
* **Final cost Milly will lose:** The total cost Milly pays is $3.00, and she gets a $24.00 refund.  So, Milly will lose $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Here's how we can figure out how much Boris makes in the fourth week:

* **Week 1:** Boris makes 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He makes half as much as week 1, so he makes 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He makes three times as much as week 1, so he makes 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:**  8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find out how much he makes in week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"The installation cost is $129.00 for the basic package.  Angela needs to pay extra for the mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures.  Here's how to calculate the total cost:

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony.  To find this, we can use the following: 
   * 40% of Anthony's savings is (0.40) * $30.00 = $12.00
   * Roy's savings is Anthony's savings + the extra amount: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

"To figure out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work our way up through the chain of lifting abilities. 

* **Pompei:**  We know Pompei can lift 1 inch.
* **Saskay:**  Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so she can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami:** Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto:** Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Finally, to convert that to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet. 

**Answer:** 40 feet

"
"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key is to realize that the time it takes to travel a distance is directly proportional to the speed.  
* **Setting up the Proportion:**  Let's say the distance is 'd'.  We know:
    * 3 kangaroos travel 'd' in 18 hours.
    * 4 turtles travel 'd' in 't' hours.
* **Using the Formula:** We can set up a proportion: 
    * (3 kangaroos) * (x) = (4 turtles) * (x/2)
* **Solving for 't':**  
    * 3x = 2x * t
    * t = 3/2 hours

"To find the total length of glue sticks that are not used, we need to first find the total length of glue used. 

*  We can do this by finding a common denominator for the fractions: 1/6, 2/3, and 1/2. The least common denominator is 6.
*  Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6: 
    * 1/6 = 1/6 * (1/1) = 1/6
    * 2/3 = 2/3 * (2/2) = 4/6
    * 1/2 = 1/2 * (3/3) = 3/6
*  Now we can add the fractions: 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6
*  Since we want the total length of glue sticks that are not used, we subtract the length of glue used from the total length of the glue sticks: 12 mm - (8/6) mm = 12 mm - (4/3) mm
*  Simplifying the answer: 12 mm - (4/3) mm = (12 * 3) mm - (4 * 1) mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm

*  The total number of bologna thrown is 58, so 2r + 3y = 58.
*  We also know that 20 of the balloons are red, so r = 20.

Now we can substitute r = 20 into the equation: 2(20) + 3y = 58.

Simplifying the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

Solving for y: 3y = 18.

Therefore, y = 6.

"Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.  Each cinnamon roll has 600 calories and each blueberry muffin has 450 calories.  Since a mini pastry has 1/3 the calories of a normal version, we need to figure out the calories for each type of pastry. 

A mini cinnamon roll has 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories. 
A mini blueberry muffin has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

To find the total calories for the cinnamon rolls, we multiply the number of rolls by the calories per roll: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

To find the total calories for the blueberry muffins, we multiply the number of muffins by the calories per muffin: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, to find the total calories for all pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John.  We need to find Peter's age.

Let's use variables:

*  Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be represented by ""P + 10"" (since he's 10 years older than John)
*  Let John's age be represented by ""J""

Now we can set up equations:

*  P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
*  P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Let's solve for the ages:

*  Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
*  Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
*  We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

Now, substitute the value of J into the second equation:

*  P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
*  Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
*  Combine like terms: 3P = 110
*  Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Answer:**  Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.

* Total cost: $40 (visit) + $78.75 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $178.75 

So the total cost for the job was $178.75. 


**Answer:** $178.75

"Here's how to figure out how much money James lost:

* **Calculate the original cost:** 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150
* **Calculate the discount:** $150 * 0.40 = $60
* **Calculate the price after the discount:** $150 - $60 = $90
* **Calculate the number of CDs he keeps:** 10 CDs - 5 CDs = 5 CDs
* **Calculate the selling price of the CDs he keeps:** 5 CDs * $40/CD = $200
* **Calculate his total earnings:** $200
* **Calculate his total cost:** $150
* **Calculate his net loss:** $150 - $200 = -$50

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.**
   He swims 60% of 20 miles, which is (60/100) * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the time James spends swimming.**
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

* **Step 3: Calculate the rest time.**
   Rest time = Half the swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

* **Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**
   Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

* **Step 5: Calculate the speed James uses for the remaining distance.**
   Speed = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour

* **Step 6: Calculate the time James takes to finish the remaining distance.**
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

* **Step 7: Calculate the total time.**
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining time
   Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

**Answer:** 17 hours

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. 
* Let's use variables to represent each person's score:
    * Dinar's score is represented by ""D""
    * Azibo's score is represented by ""A""
    * Bahati's score is represented by ""B""

* We can set up equations based on the given information:
    * B = A + 20 
    * B = D + 10
    * A + D + B = 45

*  Since we know B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
    * D + 10 = A + 20
    * A = D - 10

* Now, let's substitute this value of A into the total points equation:
    * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

* Simplify and solve for D:
    * 3D + 10 = 45
    * 3D = 35
    * D = 35 / 3
    * D = 11.67 (approximately)

* Now that we know D, we can find A:
    * A = D - 10
    * A = 11.67 - 10
    * A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"Let's figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught!

We know Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.  Let's break it down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * We know that A = S + 5 and S = 4W - 13.  Let's substitute the first equation into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan caught 151 Pokemon.

"Here's how to figure out the total howl time:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, who howls for 20 seconds. So Chikote howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.
* **Total time for Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same amount of time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he also howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total age of the group is 20 years.
* We also know that Helene is twice the average age of the group.
* We are given Akbar's age is 3 years and Alessandro's age is 4 years.

To find Wilfred's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the average age:** The average age of the group is (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age + Wilfred's age) / 4.
2. **Find Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (average age) = 2 * (20 / 4) = 10 years.
3. **Calculate the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro:** Akbar's age + Alessandro's age = 3 + 4 = 7 years.
4. **Find Wilfred's age:** The total age of all the children minus Helene's age and the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro equals Wilfred's age.  Therefore, Wilfred's age is 20 - 10 - 7 = 3 years.

"Here's how to figure out the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:

* **Let's say each kid gets 'x' slices.**  
* **Adults get twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult gets 2x slices.**
* **The total slices are 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).**
* **To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to find the fraction of the watermelon the adults get.**

**The fraction of the watermelon the adults get is (2x / 6) = (x/3).**

**To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:**

(x/3) * 100% = **(x/3) * 100%**


**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/3) * 100%.**

"Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients to check on.  That takes 9 * 20 minutes = 180 minutes.  He also has 10 appointments, which take 30 minutes each, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.  In total, he spends 180 + 300 = 480 minutes.  He has 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes available.  So, he has 540 - 480 = 60 minutes left to update his records.

"Jordan needs to make the cake by 5:00 pm, so let's figure out when she should start. 

* **Cake batter:** 20 minutes
* **Baking:** 30 minutes
* **Cooling:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
* **Frosting:** 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

* **Sessions per week:** They rent the studio 3 days a week.
* **Total earnings per month:**  They have 10 students and rent the studio 3 days a week, so they have 12 sessions per month. 
* **Total earnings:** 12 sessions * $40/session = $480 


"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Peter's chocolate bars:** Peter has 64 total chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.
* **Martha's chocolate bars:** Martha has 56 total chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.
* **The difference:** Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Here's how we can figure out the porcupine population after a year:

* **Starting population:** We begin with 50 porcupines.
* **Female porcupines:**  Since 3/5 of the population is female, we have 30 female porcupines.
* **Births per year:** Each female gives birth to 4 babies per month, so in a year, they'll have 4 * 12 = 48 babies.
* **Total increase:**  The population increases by 48 babies, so we add that to the initial number of females. 

Therefore, the final population after a year will be 50 + 48 = 98 porcupines.

"To figure out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first.  

The volume of a rectangular prism (like a pool) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.  So, the volume of this pool is:

* Length x Width x Depth 
* 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

Now, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  There are 7.48 gallons in one cubic foot.  So, the volume in gallons is:

* 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10,392 gallons

Finally, we need to multiply the volume in gallons by the price per gallon, which is $0.10.  

* 10,392 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $1039.20

**Answer:** $1039.20

"Here's how to figure out how much water is left in the tank:

* **Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that amount, which is 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.  Together they pump 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.
* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on day 1, which is 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she did on day 1, which is 1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. Together they pump 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.
* **Total:**  In two days, they pump a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.
* **Remaining:**  The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, and they pumped 12000 gallons, so there are 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons left.

"Here's how we can figure out the initial charge:

* **Step 1:  Think about the power bank's capacity.**  We know the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.
* **Step 2:  Calculate the remaining charge after 5 hours.**  The power bank had 100% - 45% = 55% of its charge left after 5 hours.
* **Step 3:  Calculate the charge after 3 hours.** The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **Step 4:  Calculate the remaining charge after 8 hours.** The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of each large stuffed animal is $12 (3 times the price of a small stuffed animal).**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Sally started with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons.  After the wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, she had 15 red balloons remaining.  She then released half of her yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.  Finally, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 6 of them to her collection.  

Therefore, Sally carried 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons into school.

"Here's how to figure out the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

* **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher**  There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework.
* **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher** There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension.
* **Scenario 3:  Personal Extension** There's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment.

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possible scenarios:

* **Scenario 1 and 2:**  The probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework and the normal teacher giving an extension is 20% (50% * 40%).
* **Scenario 1 and 3:** The probability of the substitute teacher not collecting the homework and Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 20% (50% * 20%).
* **Scenario 2 and 3:** The probability of the normal teacher giving an extension and Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment is 8% (40% * 20%).

**Therefore, the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 20% + 20% + 8% = 48%.**

"To figure out how long it takes Jim to make enough money to pay off his loans and make up for the income he lost while in school, we need to consider his new salary and the total amount he needs to earn.

* **New Salary:** Jim's degree increased his income by a factor of 3, so he now makes $75,000 per year.
* **Total Loan Payments:** He has $200,000 in loans to pay off.
* **Lost Income:**  He lost $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Total to Earn:** To cover his loans and lost income, he needs to earn $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

**To figure out how long it takes to earn $300,000, we can divide the total amount by his new annual salary:**

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

* **Wednesday:** Twice the number delivered on Tuesday, which is 102 * 2 = 204 letters. They delivered 5 more than that, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered, we add the deliveries from each day: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Let's figure out how many balls Rory retrieved in the first set.

*  We know he retrieved 19 balls in total.
*  The second set had 'x' balls, and the third set had 'x/2' balls.
*  We can set up an equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Let's solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: 
   (5/2)x + 4 = 19

2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 
   (5/2)x = 15

3. Multiply both sides by 2/5:
   x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

*  The first set had x + 4 balls, so he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's say Sam has 'x' feet of fence.  Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry has 'x + 60' feet.  

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so:
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:
2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.

"To find out how many days it takes Alfie to fly half the circumference of the Earth, we need to figure out how many days it takes to cover half of the Earth's circumference. 

The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 kilometers.  To find half of that, we divide: 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Now, we need to know how many days it takes Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers.  We know he flies 400 kilometers per day.  So, we divide the distance by his daily flight distance: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.

"The fastest car ever made is a bit of a tricky question because there are different ways to measure speed.  We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour.  The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it goes 120 * 5 = 600 miles per hour.  The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, so it goes 600 * 1.25 = 750 miles per hour. 

**Answer:** 750 mph

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call that number 'x'.
* Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  Since they painted together, we can write that as:  'y' (Sarah's eggs) + (y + 12) = 30 
*  This simplifies to: 2y + 12 = 30
*  Solving for 'y', we get: 2y = 18, so y = 9. This means Sarah painted 9 eggs.
*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we need to find the value of 'x'.  We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so we can write that as: x + x = 2x. 
*  We also know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.  We can write this as: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56.
*  Substituting the value of 'y' and simplifying, we get: 2x + (2(9) + 12) = 56.
*  This simplifies to: 2x + 30 = 56.
*  Solving for 'x', we get: 2x = 26, so x = 13.

**Answer:**  Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs. The difference is 21 - 13 = 8.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the yellow rope is 'x' centimeters long.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, meaning it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can write this as an equation:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (x = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * 3.5 = $14,000.  He had to return 2/5 of the milk because it was spoiled, which is 4000 * (2/5) = 1600 gallons.  The refund amount is the difference between the total cost and the cost of the spoiled milk: $14,000 - (1600 * 3.5) = $14,000 - $5,600 = $8,400. 

**Answer:** $8,400

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""**

We know that in the future, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age in 25 years.  This can be written as an equation:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

We also know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

* W = 5(C + 7)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for C (Colin's current age) and W (Wendy's current age).

**Solving for C:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

**Answer:** Colin is currently 12.5 years old.

"Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for three schools.  He can buy 100 books for $500.  To figure out how many books he can buy per school, we need to figure out how much money each school gets.  

He has $27,000 / 3 schools = $9,000 per school.  

Since he can buy 100 books for $500, he can buy 100 books / $500 = 2 books per $500.

Therefore, he can buy 2 books per $500 * $9,000 / 3 schools = 600 books per school.

"Let's solve this problem!

Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies. We know:

*  b = 3c - 2  (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets 2.  So:

* 2c + 2b = 10

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 6c - 4 = 10
* 8c - 4 = 10

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
* Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.

We're given that Samantha has 27 paintings.  Let's use this information to find out how many paintings Kim has.

Let 'x' represent the number of paintings Kim has.  

* Shelley has x + 8 paintings.
* Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so:
(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Now, let's solve for x:
x - 4 = 27
x = 31

**Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.**

"Let's figure this out!

We know Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We also know that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is then 5x - 4.  We can set up an equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now, let's solve for x:

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  

The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

"Here's how to figure out the total number of candles and flashlights:

* **Flashlights:**  Since there are 4 people in the house, they have 4 flashlights.
* **Candles:** 
    * Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 small candles.
    * The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 medium candles.
    * Total candles: 8 small candles + 8 medium candles = 16 candles.

"Tim needs 7 lemons. Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Lemons per gallon:**  The recipe states that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
* **Total juice needed:** Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, so he needs 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of juice.
* **Extra gallon:**  He wants to make an extra gallon, which is twice as tart as the other gallons. This means he needs 4 cups * 2 = 8 cups of juice.
* **Lemons for extra gallon:**  To get 8 cups of juice, he needs 8 cups / 6 lemons/cup = 1.33 lemons. Since you can't have a fraction of a lemon, he needs to buy 1 more lemon.

"The boat depreciates by 30% each year.  So, after the first year, it's worth 70% of its original price ($9000 * 0.70 = $6300).  Then, in the second year, it depreciates another 30% of the value from the first year, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.  Finally, in the third year, it depreciates 20% of the value from the second year, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **We know Igor gathered:**
    * 8 test tubes (half of the requested 16)
    * 16 Petri dishes (2 more than the requested 14)
* **The total number of items Igor had on the bench is 29.**

To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to figure out how many beakers he had initially.  

* **Let's use the information we know:**
    * 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + beakers = 29 
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes. 
    * We can solve for the number of beakers. 

* **Let's solve for the number of beakers:**
    * 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * 24 + beakers = 29
    * beakers = 29 - 24
    * beakers = 5

**Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"Here's how we can solve this problem:

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To find the number of chickens, we can use the first equation to solve for 'w':

* w = 20 - c

Now, substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.
