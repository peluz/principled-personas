"Let's break down the problem:

* **Seattle has 20 sheep.**
* **Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.**
* **Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.**
* **To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.**

"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something.  He wants to get home in 4 hours, but it takes him 2 hours in traffic.  He then drives for 30 minutes at 30 mph, and the rest of the time he drives at 80 mph.  

To figure out how far he is from home, we need to figure out how far he drove in the last 4 hours.  

* He drives for 4 hours at 80 mph, so he travels 80 miles per hour * 4 hours = 320 miles. 
* He also drove for 2 hours in traffic, so he traveled 30 miles in that time.
* He drove for 30 minutes at 30 mph, so he traveled 30 miles / 60 minutes = 0.5 miles. 
* He drove for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he traveled 60 miles per hour * 3 hours = 180 miles. 

Now, let's add up all the miles he drove: 320 miles + 30 miles + 0.5 miles + 180 miles = 530 miles. 

**Answer:** 530 miles

"The book was on sale for $19.50, and that's 25% off the original price.  To find the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount. 

Think about it like this:

* The discount is like taking off a part of the original price.
* We know the sale price is $19.50, and we know the discount is 25%. 

Let's use a little math to find the original price. 

* We can think of the discount as taking 25% of the original price. 
* We can write this as a fraction: 0.25
* We can also write this as a decimal: 0.25
* We can then subtract the discount from the sale price to find the original price. 

So, we have: $19.50 - (0.25 * $19.50) = $19.50 - $4.88 = $14.62

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $14.62**

* Shorts: 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
* Pants: 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
* Shoes: 3 * $42.00 = $126.00

"Let's break this down!

We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11.  This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.

We also know their total age is 162.  Let's use that to find out how old each person is now.

* Let Darrell's age be represented by 7x
* Let Allen's age be represented by 11x

We can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms: 18x = 162

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 18: x = 9

Now that we know Darrell's age is 7x, we can find his age: 7 * 9 = 63

Now, let's find Allen's age in 10 years. Allen's age is 11x, so Allen's age in 10 years will be 11 * 9 = 99.

**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 99.

"John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.  To find out how many hours he spends taking care of the dogs each week, we need to do a little math. 

* Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day.
* He has 10 dogs.
* So, he spends 0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours a day taking care of the dogs.
* He does this every day of the week, so he spends 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours a week. 

**Answer:** 35 
"
"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  To find out how many gold coins she has, we need to figure out how many silver coins she has.

Let's use a simple way to solve this:

* Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.
* Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has x + 30 gold coins.
* The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110
* Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than the first 20 minutes.  To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 20 minutes.  That's 20 minutes * 0.25 = 5 points.  So, he scored 4 points + 5 points = 9 points in the second 20 minutes.  In total, he scored 4 points + 9 points = 13 points.

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they're on sale for $5.00 for 4 yogurts.  To figure out how much he spends in 30 days, we need to figure out how much he spends on one yogurt and then multiply that by the number of yogurts he eats in a day. 

Here's how:

* **Cost per yogurt:** $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt
* **Total cost for 30 days:** $1.25/yogurt * 30 yogurts = $37.50

So, Terry spends $37.50 on yogurt in 30 days.

* He sold his Lego sets for $195.
* He spent $160 on video games.
* He had $5 left over.

So, he had $195 + $5 = $200 before buying the video games. 

He had $200 and bought $160 worth of video games.  

He has $200 - $160 = $40 left. 

He has 13 Lego sets.

"Okay, so the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.  If you have 5 servings, that's 250 calories * 5 = 1250 calories.  You've already eaten 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.  To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to figure out how many servings are in 200 calories.  Each serving has 250 calories, so you can eat 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.  Since each serving is 250 grams, you can eat 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams.

"
"John bought 5 blue ties, and each tie cost $40.  He spent $200 on blue ties.  To find out how much he spent on red ties, we need to figure out how much each red tie costs.  Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can figure out the price of a red tie by adding 50% to the price of a blue tie.  

The price of a blue tie is $40.  50% of $40 is $20.  So, the price of a red tie is $40 + $20 = $60.

John bought 10 red ties.  The total cost of the red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.  

So, John spent $800 on ties in total.

"Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds from his bag.  He has 30 comic books, and each comic weighs 1/4 of a pound.  To find out how many toys he needs to take out, we need to figure out how much weight is in the comic books. 

* 30 comic books * (1/4 pound/comic book) = 7.5 pounds

Now, we know that he needs to take out 15 pounds total.  We can find out how many toys he needs to take out by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove.

"The mechanic made more money on Thursday. Here's why:

* **Thursday:** The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, making $60 * 6 = $360.  They also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each, making $40 * 4 = $160.  The total revenue for Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.
* **Friday:** The mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, making $40 * 12 = $480.  The mechanic didn't repair any truck tires on Friday. 
* **The difference:** The mechanic made $520 on Thursday and $480 on Friday.  $520 - $480 = $40.

"Cecilia needs to feed her puppy a lot of food!  She'll need 180 cups of food for the first 180 days.  Then, she'll need to feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.  That's a lot of food!  

To figure out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to know how many days the puppy lives.  Let's say the puppy lives for a year.  That's 365 days.  

To figure out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to figure out how many cups of food she'll need in a year.  She'll need 180 cups for the first 180 days, and then 2 cups a day for the rest of its life, so that's 365 days * 2 cups/day = 730 cups.  

Now, we can figure out how many bags of food she'll need.  She'll need 730 cups / 110 cups/bag = 6.64 bags.  Since you can't buy parts of a bag, she'll need to buy 7 bags of food.

"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.  To figure out how much he saves, we need to see which is cheaper to buy 18 flowers.

* **3-flower packages:** $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower
* **2-flower packages:** $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

If he buys 18 flowers with the 2-flower packages, it will cost $18 * $0.50 = $9.00.

If he buys 18 flowers with the 3-flower packages, it will cost $18 * $0.83 = $14.94.

Vincent saves $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94 by buying 18 flowers with the 2-flower packages.

"If a team won 8 more games than they lost, we can figure out how many they won by using a simple equation. 

Let's say they lost 'x' games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 'x + 8' games.  

The total number of games they played is the sum of their wins and losses, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Let's solve for 'x':

* Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many they won:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

So, they won 15 games.

"If Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, we can figure out how many Harald sold by thinking about how many copies they sold together. 

Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies.  Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies.  Together they sold 88,000 copies.  

So, we can write an equation: x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000

To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


**Answer:** Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Let's use a simple equation to figure out how many cookies he baked last year:

* Let 'x' be the number of cookies he baked last year.
* This year he baked 2x cookies.
* He baked 15 more than he intended, so 2x + 15 = 110.

"Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone.  We know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos.  To find out how many birds are in Jamal's photo, we need to figure out how many photos Jamal's phone can hold.  We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos.  

To find out how many birds are in Jamal's photo, we can use the information that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photo.  We know that Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos, so we can find the number of birds in Jamal's photo by dividing 300 by 50.

"Sasha has some leftover lumber to sell!  She has 10 boards that are 2x4x10, and she also has 5 boards that are 4x4x10.  To figure out how much money she'll make, we need to know how much she sells each board for. 

Let's say she sells each 2x4x10 board for $15.  Here's how to figure out her profit:

* **Cost of the 2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **Cost of the 4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total cost:** $150 + $80 = $230

Now, let's figure out how much she makes from selling all the boards. 

* **Selling price of the 2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **Selling price of the 4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total selling price:** $150 + $80 = $230

**Profit:** $230 - $230 = $0

Sasha makes $0 profit.

"Let's break this down!

We know Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar she uses, she uses 13 cups of water.

We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find out how many cups of water she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the ratio that is.

*  We can set up a simple equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons 
*  To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 7: x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

Now, since the ratio is 7:13, we know that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  

*  To find out how many cups of water she used, we can multiply the value of 'x' by 13: 17.14 * 13 = 222.82 (approximately)


**Answer:** Katy used approximately 222.82 cups of water.

"We know that on the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.  The total number of vehicles at the port is 30, so we need to find out how many more vehicles were brought in on the second day.  We know that the total number of vehicles is 40, so we can figure out how many containers were brought in on the second day by dividing the total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container. 40 / 5 = 8.  So, there were **8** containers brought in on the second day.

"Okay, so we know Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.  Let's figure out how much they both make now.

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
* Adrien's salary now is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.
* Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).
* Lylah's salary now is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

So, Adrien and Lylah's total salary four years later is $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.

"The hospital makes a profit of $10,000. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Patients:** The hospital sees 500 people each day.
* **Time per patient:** Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
* **Total time:**  The hospital sees 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
* **Doctor's fees:** The doctors charge $150 per hour.
* **Total doctor's fees:** The doctors work 200 hours.  So, the total doctor's fees are 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.
* **Profit:** The hospital makes $40,000 from patient charges and $30,000 from doctor's fees, so the profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?

* **A.** 13
* **B.** 24
* **C.** 41
* **D.** 4 

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and 24 miles on Tuesday.  To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to find the total distance for Monday and Tuesday, then subtract that from the total mileage for Monday through Wednesday. 

The total distance for Monday and Tuesday is 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles. 

The total mileage for Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. 

So, Walt walked 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Okay, so we know there are 700 bees in the hive.  

*  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.  
*  We also know there are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some math to figure out how many worker bees there are.

*  Let's say there are 'q' queens.
*  Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are 2q baby bees.
*  And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 2 * 2q = 4q worker bees.

Now, we know the total number of bees is 700.  So, we can write an equation:

q + 2q + 4q = 700

Let's solve for q:

7q = 700
q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queens, we can find the number of worker bees:

Worker bees = 2 * baby bees = 2 * 2q = 2 * 2 * 100 = 400

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

"If Charlie has 12 friends, and that's three times Dorothy's number, then Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends.  James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"Okay, so Steve lives 3 miles away and can bike 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. 

To figure out who gets home first, we need to see who takes longer to travel the distance. 

* **Steve's distance:** 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* **Tim's distance:** 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Let's calculate how long it takes Steve to bike to his house:

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Now let's calculate how long it takes Tim to skateboard to his house:

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The winner is the one who takes less time, so Tim is the winner. 

Tim will be waiting at his house for 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes. 


**Answer:** 4 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of Dave's fries, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. **Pigeons' feast:** Three pigeons ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

3. **Remaining fries:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.

4. **Raccoon's grab:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.

5. **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Answer:** There were **7** french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.  How many fish did they catch in total?

*  A. 19
*  B. 22
*  C. 32
*  D. 35

**Answer: C** 
 
Let's break it down:

* Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.
* Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
* Locsin also caught 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.
* Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish, we add up the number of fish each person caught: 10 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 32.

"Let's figure this out!

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 'B' years old, Seth is 2B years old.

In two years, their ages will add up to 28.  So, we can write an equation:

2B + B + 2 = 28

Let's solve for B:

* Combine like terms: 3B + 2 = 28
* Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
* Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

Seth is 2 times Brooke's age, so Seth is 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 years old.

Let's figure out how much money he has left.

* **Rent:** Zaid spends 1/4 of his money on rent, which is 6000$ * (1/4) = 1500$.
* **Gas:** He spends 1/3 of his money on gas, which is 6000$ * (1/3) = 2000$.
* **Total Expenses:**  He spends 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$
* **Money Left:**  He has 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$ left.
* **Charity:** He gives half of the money left to charity, which is 2500$ / 2 = 1250$.
* **Money After Charity:** He has 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$ left.
* **Money for Daughter and Wife:** He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, which is $200 + $700 = $900$.
* **Final Money:** He has 1250$ - 900$ = 350$ left.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

* The faster team's runners are all really good! They run each 400 meters in 55 seconds.
* The other team is a little slower. Their first runner runs in 60 seconds. 
* The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so they run in 63 seconds.
* The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 66 seconds.
* The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 69 seconds.
* To find the difference in time, we need to subtract the time of the slower team from the time of the faster team. 
* The faster team's time is 220 seconds.
* The slower team's time is 258 seconds. 
* The difference is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"Here's how to figure out the answer:

* **Think about the possibilities:**  There are 6 sides on a die, so there are 6 different numbers we could roll.
* **What's the chance of rolling a number bigger than 3?**  There are 3 numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6). So, the chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 50%.
* **What's the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row?**  There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6).  The chance of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2.  The chance of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2. So, the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 or 25%.
* **Find the difference:**  The chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 is 50%, and the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.  The difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.

*  To find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

**Answer: $145**

"Sara needs to earn $60 more to buy the jacket and shoes.  She earns $24 for each lawn mowing.  To figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the total money she needs by how much she earns per mowing: $60 / $24 = 2.5.  Since she can't mow half a lawn, Sara needs to mow the lawn **3** times.

"Let's break this down!

We know Jerry has a total of 42 eggs each day.  

* Red chickens lay 3 eggs each day.
* White chickens lay 5 eggs each day.

To find out how many red chickens he has, we need to figure out how many eggs the red chickens lay. 

Let's use the information we have:

*  3r + 5w = 42 
*  r = w + 2

We can use the second equation to solve for 'r'.  

*  r = w + 2

Now, let's substitute this into the first equation:

* 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

Let's solve for 'w':

* 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* 8w + 6 = 42
* 8w = 36
* w = 4.5

We can't have half a chicken, so there's something wrong with the problem. 


**Answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"To find out how long Gary walks, we need to figure out how long it takes to walk the whole perimeter of the park. 

The park is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

We know the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Let's plug those in:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5 miles
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, Gary spends **5 hours** walking.

"Here's how we can figure out how much water is in the small pool:

* **Let's think about the problem:**  The big pool is emptying faster than the small pool, so the small pool will have less water.

* **Think about the time:**  The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.  

* **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
   * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   * The big pool now has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
   * 8x = 4(x - 16)
   * 8x = 4x - 64
   * 4x = -64
   * x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way.


**Final answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back $165 a month for 12 months.  She's also supposed to pay an extra 10% of the original amount.  

To figure out how much she'll owe after 12 months, we need to figure out how much she'll pay in total.  

* First, we need to figure out how much extra she'll pay. 10% of $2000 is $200.
* Now, we need to add that extra amount to the total amount she'll pay.  So, she'll pay $165 a month for 12 months, which is $165 * 12 = $2040.
* Finally, we need to add the extra $200 to that. So, she'll pay a total of $2040 + $200 = $2240. 


So, Janeth will have a remaining balance of $2240.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:** Harriet is half Zack's age, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find their average age in three years, we need to add their ages in three years and then divide by 3. 

* **Adrian's age in three years:** 63 + 3 = 66 years old
* **Harriet's age in three years:** 21 + 3 = 24 years old
* **Zack's age in three years:** 42 + 3 = 45 years old

Now, let's calculate the average: (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years old.

"Here's how to figure out how many points Jojo scored:

* **Naomi's points:** Naomi scored 68 points.
* **Yuri's points:** Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, which is 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* **Brianna's points:** Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* **Total points:**  The total points for all four students is 68 + 44 + 85 + Jojo's points.
* **Jojo's points:**  We know the total points are 251, so we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the other students' points from the total: 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104.

**Answer:** Jojo scored 104 points.

"Okay, so we have two aquariums.  

* The first aquarium has 4 snails.
* The second aquarium has 32 snails.

The difference between the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  

To figure out how many fish are in each aquarium, we need to figure out how many snails are in each aquarium. 

Let's think about it like this:

* The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
* The difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 
* So, 28 snails is equal to 2 times the number of fish in both aquariums. 
* We can find the number of fish in each aquarium by dividing 28 by 2. 
* 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour. She works for 6 hours each day and needs to do it 4 times a week for the movie. That means she'll be working for 6 hours * 4 days = 24 hours a week. 

The movie takes 5 weeks, so she'll be working for 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because she did a lot of work.  So, Jean will pay $27000 - $3000 = $24000.

"Brady has a lot of money in his piggy bank!  Here's how to figure out how much:

* **Pennies:** 100 pennies = $1.00
* **Nickels:** 40 nickels = 40 * $0.05 = $2.00
* **Dimes:** 20 dimes = 20 * $0.10 = $2.00
* **Dollar Bills:** 40 dollar bills = 40 * $1.00 = $40.00

"The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each section weighs 400 pounds.  To find out how much the whole tree weighs, we need to figure out how many sections there are. 

Since each section is 10 feet long, the tree has 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Now, we know each section weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighs 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 80,000 pounds.

Termites eat 30% of the wood, which is 80,000 pounds * 0.30 = 24,000 pounds.

The tree weighs 80,000 pounds - 24,000 pounds = 56,000 pounds. 


**Answer:** 56,000 pounds

"Let's break down the problem:

* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
* Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
* Andrea has 52 apples.

To find out how many apples Jamal has, we can subtract 8 from Andrea's apples: 52 - 8 = 44.

Now, we know Jamal has 44 apples. To find out how many bananas he has, we add 4 to his apples: 44 + 4 = 48.

Finally, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas: 44 + 48 = 92.

"Carla needs 11 cups of flour. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Cookies:** She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, for a total of 66 cookies.
* **Dozens:**  Since each dozen makes 12 cookies, she'll need 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens.
* **Flour:**  Each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, so she'll need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

"If you have 9,300 pennies, and you want to know how much money you have in a stack with two-thirds of them, you need to figure out how many pennies are in the stack. 

Two-thirds of 9,300 pennies is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Now, you know you have 6,200 pennies.  To find out how much money that is, you need to multiply that number by the value of one penny, which is $0.01. 

So, 6,200 pennies * $0.01/penny = $62.00

"The house costs $350,000.  The buyer has to pay a fee for the broker and a fee for transferring the house. The broker charges 5% of the house price, which is $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the house price, which is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.  So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500. Mrs. Cruz has $400,000 to spend, and the house costs $9,500 more.

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees to make the sale happen.  He paid $12,000 for transfer fees and $20,000 for a brokerage fee.  He also had to pay $250,000 for the rest of the house.  

To find out how much money Mr. Tan got from the sale, we need to figure out how much money he had left after paying the fees and the loan. 

* **Transfer fees:** $12,000
* **Brokerage fee:** $20,000
* **Total fees:** $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
* **Money left after fees:** $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $100,000

So, Mr. Tan got $100,000 from the sale of his house.

"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.  

After that, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

So, the total time is 20 minutes (heating) + 28 minutes (heating to 400) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 71 minutes.

"The cashier gave the mom $5.00 in change. 

**Answer:** 5.00 
"
"Okay, so the sweater has a body, a collar, and a rosette.  We know the body takes 900 stitches. The collar is a tenth of the body, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.  The rosette is twice the size of the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  The total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.  To find out how many stitches are in each sleeve, we need to find the difference between the total stitches and the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.  That's 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.  So, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. 

**Answer:** 315

"Mrs. Rylan bought a lot of seeds! She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds.  Tomato seeds cost $40 each and celery seeds cost $30 each.  To find out how much she spent, we need to add up the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds. 

* Tomato seeds cost 20 packets * $40/packet = $800
* Celery seeds cost 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400
*  In total, Mrs. Rylan spent $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.

"Sean has to memorize 84 lines. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Scene 1:** The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which has 54 lines. So, it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.  
* **Scene 1:**  He has a third of the lines in the first scene, which is 108 lines / 3 = 36 lines.
* **Scene 2:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, which has 54 lines. So, it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
* **Scene 2:** He has four-fifths of the lines in the second scene, which is 60 lines * (4/5) = 48 lines.
* **Total:**  He has to memorize a total of 36 lines + 48 lines = 84 lines.

"Okay, so we know Carly has 80 cards.  

*  2/5 of the cards have the letter A, which is 80 * (2/5) = 32 cards.
*  After taking out the A cards, she has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.
*  1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B, which is 48 * (1/2) = 24 cards.
*  That leaves us with 48 - 24 = 24 cards.
*  5/8 of the rest have the letter C, which is 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards.
*  Finally, the rest of the cards have the letter D, which is 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

So the answer is **9**.

"It will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Small holes:**  He takes 3 minutes to dig each small hole.  He's digging 30 of them, so that's 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
* **Large holes:** He takes 10 minutes to dig each large hole. He's digging 15 of them, so that's 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.
* **Total time:**  He spends 90 minutes on the small holes and 150 minutes on the large holes, for a total of 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.
* **Convert to hours:**  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"If Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20, we can figure out their ages in 10 years.  

* **Let's think about it:**  Since their ages are always changing, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages to find their ages in 10 years. 

* **To find their ages in 10 years:**
    * Mico's age in 10 years: 10 + 10 = 20
    * Marco's age in 10 years: 10 + 10 = 20

* **The sum of their ages in 10 years is:** 20 + 20 = 40 


**Answer:** 40

"Let's think about this problem step-by-step:

* **Let's say Ruby's current age is ""R""**
* **Let's say Sam's current age is ""S""**

We know:

* **R = 6S**  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1. **We can use the first equation to substitute for R in the second equation:**
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Peter bought 20 popsicles for $0.25 each, and 4 ice cream bars for $0.50 each.  To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars. 

* Popsicle cost: 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00
* Ice cream bar cost: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00
* Total cost: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid $7.00 in total.

* **Stars in the 5-star rows:** 52 stars - 24 stars = 28 stars

"To figure out how many trucks you need, we need to know how much each truck can carry.  Each truck can carry 2000 pounds.  We need to know how many times that weight is in the total weight of the flagstones. 

The total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  We divide that by the weight each truck can carry: 5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks. 

Since you can't have half a truck, you'll need **3** trucks to carry all the flagstones.

"If a car is going 60 miles per hour, and another car is going half that speed, how long would it take the slower car to travel the same distance?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* **Think about speed and distance:**  The faster car travels farther in the same amount of time.
* **Use the formula:** Distance = Speed x Time
* **Let's say the slower car travels for 't' hours.** 
* **We know the distance is 480 miles.**

**So, we can write the equation:** 480 miles = 30 miles per hour * t 

**Solve for 't':**
* Divide both sides by 30 miles per hour: 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = t
* That means t = 16 hours.

**Answer:** The slower car took **16 hours** to travel the same distance.

"Here's how to figure out how many chocolate bars each child gets:

* **Total chocolate:** There are 8 packets of chocolate, and each packet has 5 bars, so there are 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars in total.
* **Adult chocolate:**  4 adults get 6 bars each, so they eat 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars.
* **Chocolate for the kids:**  We have 40 total chocolate bars and 24 are eaten by the adults, leaving 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars for the kids.
* **Chocolate per child:**  The kids get 16 chocolate bars divided by 8 kids, which equals 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars per child.

**Answer:** Each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

"Here's how we can figure out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon:

* **Morning sales:** The bakery sells 60 loaves, and two-thirds of them are sold in the morning. So, they sell 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves in the morning.
* **Loaves left:** After the morning sales, there are 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.
* **Afternoon/Evening sales:** Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening. So, they sell 20 / 2 = 10 loaves in the afternoon and evening.

"Okay, let's figure out how much you'll save!

First, we need to know how much the milk costs.  

* **Ice cream:** The ice cream is $13, and it's now $11.  That means you save $2 for each tub.
* **Milk:** We need to know the original price of the milk to figure out how much you'll save on it. 

Let's say the milk costs $2.50.  

* **Ice cream:** 2 tubs cost $26.
* **Milk:** 4 packets cost $10 (because we need to know the original price of the milk to calculate the discount).

**To find the total savings, we need to know the original price of the milk.**

"Let's break this down:

* Cera is 46 years old now.
* Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006.

"Let's break this down!

* We know the total number of players is 105.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so let's call the number of defense players ""x"".
* The offense has 2x players.
* Special teams have half as many players as the defense, so they have x/2 players.

Now, we can write an equation to find the number of defense players:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: (7/2)x = 105
2. Multiply both sides by 2/7: x = 105 * (2/7)
3. Simplify: x = 30

**Answer:** There are 30 players on the defense.

"Jam has 24 pencils in her boxes, and her sister Meg has 46 pencils.  To find out how many boxes they need, we need to figure out how many pencils they have in total.  

To do this, we can think about it like this:

* Jam has 2 boxes of pencils, and each box has 12 pencils.
* Jam has 2 boxes * 12 pencils/box = 24 pencils.
* Meg has 46 pencils.
* To find out how many boxes they need, we need to add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has.
* 24 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 70 pencils.
* To store 70 pencils, they need 70 pencils / 12 pencils/box = 5.83 boxes. 

Since you can't have a fraction of a box, they need **6** boxes to store all their pencils.

"Okay, so the ice cubes cool the coffee by 65 degrees.  That means the coffee gets 65 degrees colder.  Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.  So, 65 degrees * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters of coffee gets weaker.  Then, the cream adds 15 milliliters of weakening.  So, the final answer is 780 + 15 = 795 milliliters.

"Let's think about this problem!

We know that for every 2 old records someone brings in, they get 1 new record.  We also know that 5 people traded records.  

We can figure out how many old records each person brought in by figuring out how many new records they got. 

* **If 5 people traded records, and they got 7 new records, that means they traded 7 / 2 = 3.5 old records.** 

Since you can't have half a record, this means there's an error in the problem.

"There are 3 groups of students.  The groups are equal, so each group has the same number of students.  The last group is 10 less than each of the other groups.  To find out how many students are in the last group, we need to figure out how many students are in the other two groups.  

Let's say the number of students in each of the other two groups is 'x'.  The total number of students in the other two groups is 2x.  The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200.  

To find out how many students are in the last group, we need to solve for x.  We know that 2x + (x - 10) = 200.  Let's solve for x:

2x + x - 10 = 200
3x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

* He has twice as many chickens as cows.

We can use this information to figure out how many of each animal he has.

* Let's say 'c' represents the number of chickens.
* Let's say 'w' represents the number of cows.

We know:

* c + w = 60 (The total number of animals)
* c = 2w (Twice as many chickens as cows)

Let's solve for 'c' and 'w':

1.  We can substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2.  Combine the 'w' terms: 3w = 60
3.  Solve for 'w' by dividing both sides by 3: w = 20
4.  Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' by using the second equation: c = 2 * 20 = 40

Now, let's figure out the total number of legs:

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Finally, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"Okay, so we know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  The blue beetle is the same weight as the frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.  The green toad is the same weight as the frog too, so it also weighs 50 pounds.  The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, so it weighs 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds.  The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it weighs 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds.  

The total weight of everything in the container is 20 pounds (the container's weight) plus the weight of the frog, beetle, toad, snake, and bird.  That's 20 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds = 190 pounds.

"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is like adding a little extra distance.  

To figure out how far he runs in a month, we need to know how many days are in a month.  There are about 30 days in a month.

So, he runs 6000 meters each day for 30 days.  That's 6000 meters * 30 days = 180,000 meters. 

**Answer:** 180,000 meters 
"
"Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, which costs $4.  Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs $4 + $5 = $9.  The difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B is $11 - $9 = $2. 

**Answer:** $2 
"
"The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs each and 50 tables with 3 legs each.  To find the total number of legs, we need to add the legs from each type of table. 

* 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs
* 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs
* 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

So the total number of legs is 310.

"Davos bought two shirts that cost $30 each.  He got a 40% discount on the shirts.  To find out how much he paid, we need to figure out the price after the discount. 

Here's how:

* **Calculate the discount:**  The discount is 40% of the price of one shirt, which is $30 * 0.40 = $12.
* **Calculate the price after the discount:**  The price of one shirt is $30, and he got a discount of $12, so the price after the discount is $30 - $12 = $18.
* **Calculate the total price:** Since he bought two shirts, the total price is $18 * 2 = $36.

**Answer:** $36

"Here's how we can figure out how many friends Morgan can invite:

* **Mini-golf:**  It costs $5 per person to play mini-golf.
* **Go-karts:** Each ride costs $10.
* **Total cost:**  We know Morgan has $90 to spend.

Let's use a little math to figure out how many friends she can invite:

* **Mini-golf:**  Let's say she invites 'x' friends.  The cost of mini-golf for all of them is 5x dollars.
* **Go-karts:** She wants to go twice, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
* **Total cost:**  The total cost is 5x + 20.
* **Budget:** We know the total cost can't exceed $90.

Now we can set up an equation: 5x + 20 = 90

Let's solve for 'x':

1. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x = 70
2. Divide both sides by 5: x = 14

**Answer:** Morgan can invite 14 friends.

"Carver is 45 years old.  To find out how old his son is, we need to figure out how many years younger Carver is than twice his son's age.  

* Twice Carver's age is 2 * 45 = 90 years.
* Five years less than twice Carver's age is 90 - 5 = 85 years. 

So, Carver's son is 85 years old. 


**Answer: 85**

"The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  That means the distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it does this 3 times a day.  So, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  To figure out how many days it takes to travel that distance, we divide the total distance by the distance between services: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

So, the train needs service every 26.67 days.  That's about 27 days.

* **D.** 7.00 hours

**Answer: C** 

Here's how to figure it out:

* **To get to his friend's house:** 200 miles / 70 miles per hour = 2.86 hours
* **The detour takes a little extra time:** 10 miles / 70 miles per hour = 0.14 hours
* **Then he goes home:** 240 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3 hours

**Total time:** 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

"So, we need to figure out how much money we'll spend on the senior awards. 

First, we need to figure out how much each frame costs.  Each frame costs $20.  Then, we need to add 20% to the price of each frame.  That's like adding 20/100 of $20, which is $4.  So, each frame costs $20 + $4 = $24.

Next, we need to figure out how much it costs to etch each frame.  We need to add 20% to the price of each frame, which is $24 * 0.20 = $4.80.

Now, we need to figure out how much it costs to buy the pins.  We need to buy 2 pins, and each pin costs $5, so it costs $5 * 2 = $10.

"If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 12.8 hectares left.  To find out how much land he had at first, we can use a simple equation. 

Let's say he had 'x' hectares of land at first.  

* He sold (3/5)x hectares.
* He has 12.8 hectares left, so (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

Let's solve for x:

* (2/5)x = 12.8
* Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* x = 32 hectares

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils. 

* Erasers cost $2 each, so 6 erasers cost 6 * $2 = $12.

* The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36. 

So the answer is $36.

"If Betty and Sam have a ratio of 5:6 popsicles, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

To find out how many popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we need to figure out how many popsicles Sam has in total. 

We know the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.  

Let's think about this like a pie:

* If the ratio is 5:6, that means the total popsicles are divided into 11 slices.
* Each slice represents a popsicle.
* We know 11 slices make up the whole pie, and we have 165 popsicles. 
* To find out how many popsicles are in each slice, we divide the total popsicles by the number of slices: 165 popsicles / 11 slices = 15 popsicles per slice.

Now, we can figure out how many popsicles Sam has. 
* Sam has 6 parts of the pie, so he has 6 * 15 popsicles = 90 popsicles.
* Betty has 5 parts of the pie, so she has 5 * 15 popsicles = 75 popsicles.
* Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, so Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power every hour.  He uses it for 8 hours a day.  If he uses it for 3 hours less each day, how much less energy will he use in 30 days?

Here's how to figure that out:

* **Daily energy use:** 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours
* **Reduced daily energy use:** 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours
* **Energy saved per day:** 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours
* **Total energy saved in 30 days:** 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we need to divide by 1000. 

* **Total energy saved in kWh:** 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kWh


**Answer:** 135 kWh

"Okay, so Carolyn's company hired 40 people in May. They each worked 40 hours a week and got paid $15 an hour.  That's a total of $600 per person per week.  So, in May, they paid $600 * 40 = $24,000.

Then, in June, 1/4 of the people who worked in May had their contracts end. That's 40 / 4 = 10 people.

So, they paid 10 people $600 per week for 40 hours. That's $600 * 10 = $6,000.

Finally, the total amount of money Carolyn's company paid in the two months is $24,000 + $6,000 = $30,000.

"Tim bought two packs of fireworks. The first pack cost $400 and the second pack cost twice that amount, which is $800.  He got a 20% discount on the fireworks.  He also bought a finale firework for $150.  How much did Tim spend in total?

a) $1110
b) $1200
c) $960
d) $1000

**Answer: a) $1110** 
 
Here's how to figure that out:

* First, we need to find the total cost of the fireworks before the discount.  The first pack cost $400 and the second pack cost $800, so that's $400 + $800 = $1200.
* Then, we need to figure out how much the discount was.  The discount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
* After the discount, Tim spent $1200 - $240 = $960.
* Finally, we need to add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150.  So, the total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"We know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one.  We also know that there are 180 heads in total. Let's use that information to figure out how many dromedaries there are.

Let's use variables to help us:

*  Let 'c' be the number of camels.
*  Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

We can write two equations based on the information we have:

*  Equation 1: c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
*  Equation 2: 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

Now, let's solve for 'd' in Equation 1:

* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:

* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

So, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Cole bought two pairs of jeans on sale. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that. He saved a total of $6.  

To figure out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we need to figure out how much the jogger jeans cost before the sale. 

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.

* Cole saved $6 in total. 

* He saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.

* He saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

* The original price of the jogger jeans was $6 / (1/3) = $18.

* **Think about the fraction:**  We know that 3/4 of the students have computers.
* **The opposite:**  The students who don't have computers make up the other part.  
* **The problem:** We know 20 students don't have computers. 
* **The equation:**  Let's say there are 'x' students in total.  We can write this as: (3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* **Multiply both sides by 4:**  This gets rid of the fraction. 3x - 80 = x
* **Subtract x from both sides:** 2x - 80 = 0
* **Add 80 to both sides:** 2x = 80
* **Divide both sides by 2:** x = 40

So the answer is 6 hours.

Here's how we figure that out:

* Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per day.
* He has 4 horses.
* He feeds them twice a day, so they eat 10 pounds of oats each day.
* Over 5 days, they'll eat 10 pounds/day * 5 days = 50 pounds of oats.
* Each bag has 50 pounds of oats, so he'll need 50 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 1 bag.

"Sally buys one small pizza for $8 and one big pizza that costs three times as much as the small pizza. How much does she spend in all?

Here's how to solve the problem:

* The big pizza costs three times the price of the small pizza, so it costs 3 * $8 = $24.
* The total cost is the price of the small pizza plus the price of the big pizza, which is $8 + $24 = $32.

So the answer is $32.

"Angela will be three times Brett's age in four years.  To find Angela's current age, we need to figure out how old she'll be in four years. 

Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Angela will be three times Brett's age in four years, so she will be 18 * 3 = 54 years old.

To find Angela's current age, we need to subtract 4 years from her age in four years.  So, Angela is 54 - 4 = 50 years old.

Here's how we figure that out:

* Ashley brought 50 oranges.

"Okay, so Mark has to pick a place for his wife's party!  He has two choices:

* **Venue 1:**  It costs $200 no matter how many people come.  But, he has to buy food for everyone, and that costs $5 per person.
* **Venue 2:** It costs $25 per person.  The food is already included!

To figure out how many people he needs to make the two places the same price, we need to figure out when the cost is the same.

Let's think about it like this:

* **Venue 1:**  Cost = $200 + $5 * number of guests
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

We want to find the number of guests where the two prices are the same.  So, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

Now, let's solve for the number of guests:

* $200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests
* $200 = $20 * number of guests
* number of guests = 10

So, Mark needs **10** guests for the two places to be the same price!

"Let's break down how to solve this problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals on the farm and the zoo: 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals is 50 animals + 80 animals = 130 animals.

"The house cost three times as much as the lot.  So, if the lot costs $x, the house costs 3x. Together, they cost $120,000.  We can write this as an equation: x + 3x = $120,000.  Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000.  To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000.  The house costs 3 times the lot, so it costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She's adding a new device that uses 2 kilowatts per hour.  

To figure out how much her electricity bill will be, we need to know how much she'll use each week. 

* **Daily:** Ada uses 12 kW/hour + 2 kW/hour = 14 kW/hour.
* **Weekly:** She uses 14 kW/hour * 7 days/week = 98 kW/week.

Now, we need to figure out how much her electricity bill will be. 

* **Before the new device:** Her weekly bill is 98 kW/week * $1.50/kW/hour = $147.00.
* **After the new device:** Her weekly bill is also $147.00. 

The difference is $147.00 - $147.00 = $0.00.

"Errol bought a computer, two monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. If the computer cost $1,100, how much did one monitor cost?

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

* We know the computer cost $1,100.
* The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.
* The total cost of the monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600.
* Each monitor cost $600 / 2 = $300.

"If Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can figure out how much Jeff gets by thinking about the total money.  

Brad gets 'x' dollars.  Jeff gets 4 times that amount, so he gets 4x dollars.  

Together, they have 100 dollars.  So, we can write an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 20

Now, we can find out how much Jeff gets:

Jeff gets 4 times Brad's amount, so Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"Okay, so Daniel wants to buy some school stuff.  He needs five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set.  

First, let's figure out how much everything costs:

* Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
* Pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
* Calculator: $12.00
* Geometry set: $10.00

Now, let's add up the cost of everything: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

The shop gives a 10% discount on everything, so we need to subtract 10% of the total cost: $20.00 * 0.10 = $2.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the original price: $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

So, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the stuff.

"Let's think about this problem step-by-step.

* Shiloh is 44 years old now.
* In 7 years, he will be 3 times Shiloh's nephew's age. 

Let's use 'x' to represent Shiloh's nephew's age today.  

* In 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be x + 7 years old.
* We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
* We also know that in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be 3 times Shiloh's age. So, we can write the equation: 3 * (x + 7) = 51

Now, let's solve for x:

* 3x + 21 = 51
* 3x = 30
* x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"The food truck makes $7.00 per sandwich, and they sell 10 sandwiches.  They spend $3.00 on bread and $3.00 on cheese and condiments for each sandwich.  How much money do they make?

a) $67.00
b) $70.00
c) $30.00
d) $3.00


The food truck makes $70.00 because they sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.  They spend $3.00 on bread and $3.00 on cheese and condiments for each sandwich.  So, they make $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00.

"The carpet will cost Michael $11,344. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Carpet:** The carpet costs $12 per square foot, and his bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so he needs 18 * 12 = 216 square feet of carpet.
   * The total cost of the carpet is 216 * $12 = $2592
* **Padding:** He needs padding, which costs $2 per square foot, so he needs 216 * $2 = $432 for padding.
* **Removal:** The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, so he'll need to pay $4 * 216 = $864 for removal.
* **Installation:** The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet, so he'll need to pay $34 * 216 = $7456 for installation.
* **Total Cost:** To find the total cost, we add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7456 = $11344

"Okay, so we have this train that starts at 20.  

First, we take half of that, which is 10. Then we add it to the starting value, so we have 20 + 10 = 30. 

Next, we divide that by 5, which gives us 30 / 5 = 6.  

Finally, we multiply that result by 20 minus 12, which is 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48. 

So the final value of the train is 48.

"Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.  To find the value of Juan's house, we need to subtract 30% of Herb's price. 

Herb paid $76,000 for his house.  To find out how much Juan's house costs, we need to subtract 30% of that price. 

30% of $76,000 is (30/100) * $76,000 = $22,800.

So, Juan's house costs $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

The total value of both houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She burns 1000 calories from her aerobics and 600 calories from her running.  To find out how much water she needs, we need to figure out how many calories she burned in total. 

She burned 1000 calories from aerobics and 600 calories from running, so she burned a total of 1600 calories.

Now, we can figure out how much water she needs. She needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so we can divide the total calories she burned by 200 to find out how much water she needs. 

1600 calories / 200 calories/ml = 8 ml of water.

"Okay, so the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.  

Let's figure out how many of each color there are.  

* Let's say there are 'b' jelly beans that are blue. 
* Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans as red jelly beans.
* Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans as green jelly beans.

To find out how many jelly beans are in the jar, we need to add up the number of each color.  So, we have:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Let's simplify that equation:

2.99b = 4500

Now, we can solve for 'b' (the number of blue jelly beans):

b = 4500 / 2.99

b = 1500

Now that we know there are 1500 blue jelly beans, we can figure out how many of each other color there are.

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

So, there are 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.  

To find the difference in his weight after 5 weeks, we need to calculate the weight loss from Cheerios and the weight gain from donuts.

* Cheerios weight loss: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
* Donuts weight gain: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight is 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds.

"Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  To find out how old he'll be in 3 years, we need to figure out his age now. 

Let's think about it like this:

*  If Jerry is currently 'x' years old, five years ago he was 'x - 5' years old.

*  We know that 'x' is twice as old as 'x - 5'.  

*  So, we can write an equation: x = 2(x - 5)

*  Let's solve for 'x':
    * x = 2x - 10
    * x - 2x = -10
    * -x = -10
    * x = 10

*  So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

*  In 3 years, he'll be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants. Each implant costs $2000.  One of the implants needs a crown, which costs $500 extra. He already paid $600.  How many hours does he need to work to pay for the dental work?

a) 150 hours
b) 293 hours
c) 293.33 hours
d) 300 hours

Answer: c 
 
To figure this out, we need to know how much the dental work costs.  The implants cost $2000 each, and he needs two, so that's $2000 * 2 = $4000.  Then, the crown costs $500, so the total cost is $4000 + $500 = $4500.  He already paid $600, so he needs to make $4500 - $600 = $3900 more.  He makes $15 per hour, so he needs to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

"Okay, so we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.  

The other two angles are:

* Twice the smallest: 2x
* Three times the smallest: 3x

So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get: 6x = 180

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now, the largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

* **Nickels:** 14 nickels is equal to $0.70
* **Pennies:** 15 pennies is equal to $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

To figure out how many gumballs he can buy, we need to divide the total money by the cost of each gumball: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69

**Answer:** Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"Okay, so Joe wants to buy a shirt and shorts for a field trip.  The shirt is $25, and the shorts are $35.  

First, the store has a 30% off sale on everything.  So, the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.  Then, the shorts are $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Now, we need to figure out how much Joe will have left after the sale.  Let's say the sales tax is 6%.  That means he'll pay $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65.

"Here's how to figure out the difference in price:

* **Day 1:** Clara bought 20 pomegranates for $400. She got a $2 discount, so each pomegranate cost $18.  
* **Day 2:** The price went up to $30 per pomegranate.  She bought 20 pomegranates for $600.
* **Difference:**  To find the difference, we subtract the price from Day 1 from the price from Day 2.  $600 - $400 = $200.

"Ariadne sold red hats for $400 and green hats for $200 in the first month.  To find the total amount she made in the first month, we add those amounts together: $400 + $200 = $600.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of the amount she made in the first month.  To find that amount, we multiply the first month's total by 3/4: $600 * (3/4) = $450.

So, in two months, Ariadne made $600 + $450 = $1050. 

**Answer:** $1050

"Here's how we can figure out how many sheep are on Lee's farm:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 's' be the number of sheep.
    *  Let 'g' be the number of geese.

* **We know:**
    *  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  The total number of legs is 70.  So, 4s + 2g = 70
    *  Sheep and geese have a total of 20 heads.  So, s + g = 20

* **Let's solve for 's' (the number of sheep):**
    *  We can use the second equation to solve for 'g':  g = 20 - s
    *  Now, substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
    *  Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

**Answer:** There are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have?

Here's how to solve it:

Let's use an equation to represent this:

* Let 'x' be the number of books Sally has.
* Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.
* Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2x + 3.
* We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write the equation: 2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

We know that the twin is 7 years older than the triplet.  This means the twin is 11 years older than the triplet.

The combined ages are 44.  We can write this as an equation: t + 3t = 44

Let's solve for 't':

* 4t = 44
* t = 44 / 4
* t = 11

So, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 times that amount, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins. So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

Over 10 years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Their total savings after 10 years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins. 

**Answer:** 5760

"Brittany's comforter has 68 square feet. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Squares:**  She has 14 red squares, 4 more than the red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
* **Green squares:** She has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* **White squares:** She has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.
* **Total squares:**  She has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

"Let's break this down!

Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoes.  We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.  Let's figure out how long Bobby's shoe is.

* Let 'x' represent the length of Bobby's shoe.
* We know that 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe is 9x.
* We also know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe, so we can write the equation: 100 = 9x + 10

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x
* Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches** long.

"If there were 33 people on the council, and the vote was split with twice as many people voting in favor as against, we can figure out how many people voted for the new regulation. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Let 'x' be the number of people who voted against the new regulation.**
* **Since there were twice as many people voting in favor, that means '2x' people voted for it.**
* **The total number of votes is the sum of the votes against and in favor, so we can write the equation: x + 2x = 33**
* **Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33**
* **To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 11**
* **Now that we know 'x' is 11, we can find the number of people who voted in favor: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22**

"Tanya earned $105 for the two days of teaching. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **Monday:**
    * She worked 5 hours at $15 per hour, so she earned 5 * 15 = $75.
    * She taught 4 classes, and since she gets $5 extra for each class over 3, she earned $5 * 1 = $5 extra.
    * Her total for Monday was $75 + $5 = $80.

* **Wednesday:**
    * She worked 2 hours at $15 per hour, so she earned 2 * 15 = $30.
    * She taught 2 classes, and since she gets $5 extra for each class over 3, she earned $5 * 0 = $0 extra.
    * Her total for Wednesday was $30.

* **Total:**
    * Her total earnings for both days were $80 + $30 = $110.

"Bennet wants to make $135 total. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he makes $60 from them.  He has 25 ears of corn to sell.  To make $135, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from the corn.  So, he needs to sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 ears = $3 per ear. 

**Answer:** $3

"Here's how to figure out what percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer:

* **Total time for soccer:** She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so that's 7 + 5 = 12 hours.
* **Time for reading:** She reads for 3 hours.
* **Time for video games:** She plays video games for 1/3 of the time left, which is 9 hours (12 - 3) / 3 = 3 hours.

**To find the percentage, we need to know how much time she spends on soccer compared to her total weekend time.**

* **Percentage of time on soccer:** (7 + 5) / 12 = 12 / 12 = 100% 


**Answer:** 100%

"Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave Brandon half of them, which is 50 / 2 = 25 pencils.  

After giving to Brandon, he had 50 - 25 = 25 pencils left.  

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is (3/5) * 25 = 15 pencils.

Finally, Anthony kept 25 - 15 = 10 pencils. 


**Answer:** 10

"Here's how to figure out how long Jack is gone from home:

* **Driving to the museum:** Jack drives 150 miles at 75 mph, so it takes him 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.
* **Driving back home:**  He also drives 150 miles back at 75 mph, so it takes him 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours.
* **Total time:**  He spends 2 hours at the museum plus 2 hours driving there and back, so he's gone for a total of 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

**Answer:** 4 hours

"To figure out how much Winston spent, we need to add up the cost of each type of fruit:

* Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00
* Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00
* Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00/pound = $18.00

"Okay, let's figure out who's the better gamer!

Here's how we can figure out the difference in their scores:

* **Points for enemies:**  Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on, and Emma gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on.
* **Points for berries:** Ava gets 5 points for each berry she collects, and Emma gets 5 points for each berry she collects.
* **Points for time:** Ava gets 30 points for each second she has left on the timer when she finishes the level, and Emma gets 30 points for each second she has left on the timer when she finishes the level.

To figure out who has the higher score, we need to know how many enemies Ava jumps on, how many berries she collects, and how long it takes her to finish the level.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to consider the number of students who passed in each grade and the total number of students in each grade.

* **Third Grade:** 340 students passed out of 500, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
* **Fourth Grade:** 40 students passed out of 100, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 0.40 or 40%.
* **Fifth Grade:** The pass rate for fifth grade is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, so it's 0.40 * 2 = 0.80 or 80%.

Now, to find the overall pass rate, we add the pass rates of each grade: 0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80 = 1.88. 

Since the overall pass rate is a percentage, we multiply the sum by 100: 1.88 * 100 = 188%.

    *  Let 'x' be the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' be the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' be the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' be the amount of oil.

* **Now we can write down what we know:**
    *  x = zest
    *  y = 2x  (Twice the amount of salt is equal to twice the amount of zest)
    *  o = 2y (Twice the amount of oil is equal to twice the amount of salt)
    *  y = z (The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar)
    *  10 ounces = x + y + z + o 

* **To find the amount of oil (o), we can use the information we have:**
    *  We know that Tanya uses 10 ounces of the mixture. 
    *  We know that the mixture is made up of salt, oil, zest, fragrance, and sugar. 
    *  We can use the information above to find the amount of oil (o). 



Let me know if you'd like me to continue solving for the amount of oil!

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20.  So Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

If Joe sells 20% of his cars, that's 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then, he gives away twice the number he sold to his mom, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

To find out how many cars Joe has left, we need to subtract the cars he sold and gave away from his original amount: 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.

"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food.  Each package of cat food has 11 tins, and each package of dog food has 6 tins.  To find out how many more cat food tins she bought than dog food tins, we need to do a subtraction. 

Here's how:

* Cat food tins: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
* Dog food tins: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins
* Difference: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more cat food tins than dog food tins.

"Let's figure out how many cards Becca has!

* **Let's use some simple math:** We know Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has. 

* **Let's use 'x' to represent the number of cards PJ has:**  This means Smendrick has 3x cards.

* **Now, let's put it all together:**  The total number of cards is 341, so we can write an equation:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47

* **Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:** Becca has 3 times PJ's amount plus 12. So, Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Mulan starts with $40. Her dad gives her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each, and a bag for $20.  

To find out how much money she has left, we need to figure out the total cost of the jeans and the bag.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two pairs, so that's $30 * 2 = $60.  The bag costs $20.  So, the total cost is $60 + $20 = $80.

Mulan has $140 total.  She spends $80, so she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.

"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars each month.  He makes 8,000 in the first week.  The second week, he makes half as much, so he makes 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.  Then, in the third week, he makes three times as much as the first week, so he makes 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.  

To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we need to find the total he made in the first three weeks, which is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  

Then, we can find out how much he makes in the fourth week by subtracting the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars. 

So the answer is 14,000.

"Britany spends a lot of time on TikTok!  She makes 18 videos a week, and each video is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.  She also spends 2 hours writing songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.  And she spends 15 minutes getting ready each day, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.  

To find out how much time she spends on TikTok in a month, we need to add up all the time she spends on each part of her TikTok routine.  That's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.  

Now, we need to figure out how many minutes that is in a month.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply 282 minutes by 4.  That's 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

"If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel a certain distance, we can figure out how long it takes 4 turtles to do the same thing. 

Here's how:

* **Kangaroo Speed:**  Let's say each kangaroo travels at a speed of 'x' miles per hour.
* **Distance:** Since they travel the same distance, we know the distance is 18x.
* **Turtle Speed:** Each turtle travels half the speed of a kangaroo, so they travel at x/2 miles per hour.
* **Time:**  To find the time it takes the turtles, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  So, the time it takes the turtles is 18x / (x/2) = 36 hours.

**Answer:** 36 hours

"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs, we need to know how much milk the farmer already has.  He gets 5 liters of milk per cow, and he has 3 cows, so he gets 5 * 3 = 15 liters of milk a day.  To get 25 liters, he needs to get 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.  To get 10 more liters, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows.

"Here's how to figure out the total length of glue sticks that are not used:

* **Find the total amount of glue used:**  We need to add up the amount of glue left in each stick. 
    * Stick 1: 1/6 of the glue is used.
    * Stick 2: 2/3 of the glue is used.
    * Stick 3: 1/2 of the glue is used.
    *  To find the total amount of glue used, we need to add these amounts together. 
    *  1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3 of the glue is used.

* **Find the total length of glue sticks that are not used:**  We can find the total length of glue sticks that are not used by subtracting the amount of glue used from the original length of the glue sticks. 
    * The original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters.
    * The total length of glue sticks that are not used is 12 mm - (4/3) mm. 
    * 12 mm - (4/3) mm = (12 * 3) mm - (4 * 1) mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm.

"Okay, so we have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 shirts.  We also know 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.  To find out how many floral shirts have no buttons, we subtract the number of shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30 shirts.  Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.  That's 30 - 20 = 10 shirts.

"Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats on Farm X and 45 goats on Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.  How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?

**Answer:** 70 
 
Let's break it down:

* **Goats sold from Farm Y:** Mr. Smith sold 10 goats * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.
* **Total goats sold:** He sold 10 goats + 20 goats = 30 goats.
* **Goats left on Farm X:** 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats.
* **Goats left on Farm Y:** 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats.
* **Total goats left:** 45 goats + 25 goats = 70 goats.

"So, we have to figure out the total cost.  We know the green baskets cost $25 each and the red baskets cost $18 each.  We also know we get a discount of $2 for each red basket.  

First, let's figure out how much the red baskets cost: 3 baskets * $18/basket = $54.  Then, we need to figure out how much we save on the red baskets: $54 * $2/basket = $108.

Now, we need to figure out the cost of the green baskets: 3 baskets * $25/basket = $75.

Finally, we add the cost of the green baskets and the discount on the red baskets to find the total cost: $75 + $108 = $183.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the ages of the three people: you, your brother, and your sister.
* You are 3 years younger than your brother.
* You are 2 years older than your sister.
* Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.

To find your age, we need to figure out how to combine all the information we have. 

Let's use variables to make it easier:

* Your age is represented by ""x""
* Your brother's age is ""x + 3""
* Your sister's age is ""x - 2""

Now, let's write an equation based on the information we have:

* x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

Let's solve the equation:

* 3x + 1 = 87
* 3x = 86
* x = 28

So, you are 28 years old!

"Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.  Here's why:

* He has 27 students.
* Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
* Glue sticks come in packs of 8.

To figure out how many packs he needs, we do:

* 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks
* 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since you can't buy parts of a pack, he needs to buy 7 packs.

"So, the plague spreads by each infected person infecting six other people.  

Here's how it works:

* **Day 1:**  We start with 10 people infected. Each infected person infects 6 others, so we have 10 * 6 = 60 new people infected.
* **Day 2:**  On day 2, the 60 new people infect 6 others each, so we have 60 * 6 = 360 new people infected.
* **Day 3:**  On day 3, the 360 new people infect 6 others each, so we have 360 * 6 = 2160 new people infected.

So, after three days, there are 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = **2630** people infected.

"Sarah sells her rope for $2 per meter.  She wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter.  To figure out how much money she'll have left, we need to know how many meters of the new rope she buys. 

Here's how to solve it:

* **Find the total amount Sarah makes:** She sells 20 meters of rope at $2 per meter, so she makes 20 * $2 = $40.
* **Find the cost of the new rope:**  Let's say Sarah buys 'x' meters of the new rope. The cost of the new rope is $1.50 * x.
* **Calculate the money Sarah has left:**  She has $40 and will spend $1.50 * x on the new rope.  The money she has left is $40 - $1.50 * x.

**Answer:**  The amount of money Sarah has left depends on how many meters of the new rope she buys.

"If Melanie is 8 years old now, in 10 years she will be 18.  To find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age, we can set up an equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take.  

So, 8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for x, we get:
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

It will take Melanie **16** years for her age to be three times her current age.

"Farmer Brown has 200 acres, and Farmer Smith has 100 more than twice that amount.  To find the total acreage, we need to figure out how much acreage Farmer Smith has. 

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres * 2 = 400 acres. 

Then, Farmer Smith has 100 more than twice Farmer Brown's acreage, so he has 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.

If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?

Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Red balloons:** Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon * 20 red balloons = 40 pieces of bologna.
* **Yellow balloons:** Benny threw 58 total pieces - 40 pieces = 18 pieces of bologna for yellow balloons.
* **Yellow balloons:** 18 pieces of bologna / 3 pieces per balloon = 6 yellow balloons.

"Here's how to figure out how much water is left in the tank:

* **Step 1: Find out how much water the tank holds.** The tank holds half the amount of water in the pool, so it holds 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.
* **Step 2: Find out how much water they pump.** Anthony and his dad pump 5000 gallons / 2 = 2500 gallons.
* **Step 3: Find out how much water is left in the tank after they pump.** The tank empties at 500 gallons per day, so after 6 days it will have emptied 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.
* **Step 4: Find out how much water is left.** The tank started with 5000 gallons and emptied 3000 gallons, leaving 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

"Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.  Each cinnamon roll has 600 calories and each blueberry muffin has 450 calories.  Since a mini pastry is 1/3 the size of a regular one, we need to figure out how many calories are in each mini pastry. 

* Cinnamon rolls: 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories per mini
* Blueberry muffins: 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories per mini

Now, let's calculate the total calories in the mini cinnamon rolls: 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

And the total calories in the mini blueberry muffins: 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

Finally, the total calories for all the pastries is 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the same as the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use variables to make things easier:

* Let Peter's age be ""P""
* Let Paul's age be ""P + 10""
* Let John's age be ""J""

Now we can write down the information we know as equations:

* P + P + J = 100  (The total age is 100)
* P = (P + 10) + J  (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

Let's solve for John's age:

* We can simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
* We can substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
* We can solve for J: J = 100 - 2P

Now, let's substitute the value of J back into the second equation:

* P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
* Simplify: P = P + 10 + 100 - 2P
* Combine like terms: 3P = 110
* Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Answer:**  Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.

"Okay, so Cameron wants to stay at the hotel for a bit longer.  He's staying for 12 hours, which is the cheaper option.  He's going to stay for 12 hours, and then he'll pay an extra 70 pesos for every hour after that.  

So, he'll pay 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.  He'll then pay 70 pesos for each of the extra 2 hours.  That's 70 pesos * 2 = 140 pesos.

So, the total cost is 1000 pesos + 140 pesos = 1140 pesos. 

Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1140 pesos = 460 pesos.

"Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Goats:** Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Nate has 15 goats, so he needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay from the goats.
* **Sheep:** Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs.  So, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay. Nate has 12 sheep, so he needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay from the sheep.
* **Total Hay:**  To find the total hay, we add the hay needed from the goats and the sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"Jen has a bunch of root crops to sell!  She has 6 yams that cost $1.50 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each.  To figure out how much she'll earn, we need to add up how much she gets for each type of crop:

* Yams: 6 yams * $1.50/yam = $9.00
* Sweet Potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.00
* Carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00

Now, let's add those amounts together: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

So, Jen will earn $34.00 from selling all her root crops. 


**Answer:** $34.00

"Okay, so James wants to swim across a lake that's 20 miles long. He can swim 2 miles per hour.  He swims for 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles.  

To figure out how long it takes him to swim, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, he swims for 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles, at a speed of 2 miles per hour.  That means it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After swimming, he takes a break for 3 hours.  

Then, he has to swim the rest of the distance, which is 8 miles.  He swims at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  

To figure out how long it takes him to swim the rest of the distance, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, it takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, we add up all the time he spent swimming and resting: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

**Answer:** 17 hours

"Let's break down the problem:

* Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo.
* Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We know that the total points for the team is 45.  Let's use variables to represent each person's score:

* Dinar's score is represented by ""D""
* Azibo's score is represented by ""A""
* Bahati's score is represented by ""B""

We can set up an equation:

* A + D + B = 45

We know that:

* B = A + 20
* B = D + 10

Let's substitute these into the equation:

* A + D + (A + 20) = 45
* A + D + A + 20 = 45
* 2A + D + 20 = 45

Now we can solve for D:

* 2A + D = 25
* D = 25 - 2A

We know that A = D - 10, so we can substitute that in:

* 2(D - 10) + D = 25
* 2D - 20 + D = 25
* 3D - 20 = 25
* 3D = 45
* D = 15

Now we can find Azibo's score (A):

* A = D - 10
* A = 15 - 10
* A = 5

**Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.**

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.  If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday, how many measuring spoons does Jonathan have left?

**Answer:** 16 

Let's break it down:

* **Measuring spoons:** Jonathan has 2/3 of the number of measuring cups, and he has two dozen cups.  
* **Calculate the number of spoons:**  To find out how many spoons he has, we need to figure out how many spoons are in a dozen cups. 
* **Convert to a whole number:**  A dozen has 12, so Jonathan has 2/3 * 12 = 8 measuring spoons. 
* **Calculate the total number of utensils:** Jonathan has 2 dozen cups + 8 measuring spoons = 32 utensils.
* **Subtract the spoons given to Pedro:** Jonathan has 32 - 6 = 26 utensils remaining.

"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and 200 of them are already filled.  That means there are 800 beds that are free.  

Now, every day, 50 new patients come in.  Over two weeks, that's 50 patients a day * 14 days = 700 patients.

To find out how many beds are free after two weeks, we need to subtract the number of patients from the total number of beds.  So, 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 beds.

"The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies, so we need to find out how much the travel cost is. 

Let's say the travel cost is represented by the variable 'x'.  We know that the travel cost is 1.5 times the cost of the supplies. 

The total cost of the supplies and travel is $400.  So, we can write the equation:

x + 1.50x = $400

Let's solve for x:

2.50x = $400
x = $400 / 2.50
x = $160

"Okay, so Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch all the Pokemon!  Let's figure out how many Stan caught.

We know Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.  

Let's use some math to figure it out!

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
    *  Let 'S' be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
    *  Let 'W' be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * We can use the first two equations to help us find S.  Let's substitute the first equation into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Now, we can substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Now that we know how many Pokemon Adelwolfe caught, we can find Stan's catch.  Let's use the second equation:
        S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan caught 151 Pokemon.

"Okay, so we need to figure out what percentage of the watermelon the adults get. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Each kid gets a slice that's the same size as 'x'.
* The adults get twice the size of a kid's slice, so they get 2x.
* We know there are 6 slices in total.

To find out what percentage of the watermelon the adults get, we need to figure out what fraction of the slices they get. 

The adults get 2x slices, and there are 6 slices in total. So, the adults get 2x/6 = x/3 of the watermelon.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100%: (x/3) * 100% = (x/3) * 100%

**So, the answer is (x/3) * 100%.**

**Answer:** 8 

**Explanation:**

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in Peter's boxes and the number in Martha's boxes. 

* Peter has 64 chocolate bars total and 4 boxes, so each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

"Teresa sells stuffed animals.  She sells them in two sizes: small and large.  She sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  She made $120 from selling the stuffed animals.  Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

* Let's use 'x' to represent the number of large stuffed animals she sold.
* Since she sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
* The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.
* The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.
* The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.
* The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120
* Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120
* Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

"Okay, so we know a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore a day.  If they use an iron pickaxe, they mine 12 pounds.  But if they use a steel pickaxe, they mine 1.5 times that amount, which is 18 pounds.

Now, we have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.  To find out how much ore they mine in a month, we need to figure out how much they mine each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a month.

So, each dwarf mines 18 pounds a day.  In a month, they mine 18 pounds/day * 30 days = 540 pounds.

**Answer:** 540

"The store sells sandwiches in different sizes.  The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, the second has 4 sandwiches for $6, and the third has 8 sandwiches.  Since the prices are proportional, we can figure out the price of the third package. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so each sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so each sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1.50.  

Since the prices are proportional, the price of the third package is $1.50 per sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $12.00.

"Jim needs fabric that's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than his bed.  His bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To find out how much fabric he needs, we need to figure out the area of the fabric pieces. 

The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they are 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length and width.  So, the area of the bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.

The area of each fabric piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

To find the total area of fabric Jim needs, we multiply the area of each piece by 2 because he needs two pieces.  So, he needs 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Okay, so we have three people sharing $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first person.  The third person got twice what the second person got.  

Let's figure out how much the first person got.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.
    *  The second person got x + $80.
    *  The third person got 2(x + $80).

* **We know the total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person:**
    * (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

* **Now we can solve for x:**
    * (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
    * 4x + $160 = $5760
    * 4x = $5600
    * x = $1400

"So, the painters worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  That's a total of 3/8 * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 63/8 days of work.  

To figure out how many hours they worked, we need to know that there are 24 hours in a day.  So, 63/8 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours.

Finally, we need to divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.  189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours/painter.

"Okay, so we know Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total.  

Let's think about the sets:

* **Second set:**  He got x balls, and we know that's the same number as the third set. 
* **Third set:** He got half as many balls as the second set, so he got x/2 balls.

So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: 
   * x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19
   * (5/2)x + 4 = 19

2. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   * (5/2)x = 15

3. Multiply both sides by 2/5:
   * x = 6

So, Rory got 6 balls in the second set.  

**Answer:**  Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.

"The car's price decreases each year because it's getting older and less valuable.  

Here's how to figure out the price in 2010:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is like taking away a part of its price.  We do this by multiplying the original price by 0.21.  So, the price is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200 less.
* **Year 2 (2009):**  We do the same thing again, this time taking away 21% of the price from the previous year.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):**  We do it one more time!  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = $9875.

"James's insurance went up 60% because he had an accident.  His normal insurance cost is $120 a month.  To find out how much he pays a year, we need to figure out how much his insurance costs now.

* His insurance is 60% more than normal, so he pays $120 + (60/100) * $120 = $120 + $72 = $192 a month.
* To find his yearly cost, we multiply his monthly cost by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"Let's figure this out!

We know that Betsy and Donovan worked together to make the meal.  Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's.  The total time they spent was 98 minutes.  

To find out how long Betsy's part took, we can use this information:

* Let's say Donovan's part took 'x' minutes.
* Betsy's part took 'x + 18' minutes.

The total time is the sum of their individual times: x + (x + 18) = 98

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, so we know Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence.  Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  Let's figure out how much is left for Sam.

*  Let's say Sam has 'x' feet of fence.
*  Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to find the difference between the total fence and Harry's fence.

*  The total fence is 100 feet.
*  Harry has 60 feet more than Sam.

So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100

Let's solve for x:

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Sam has 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.

"Marcel sold a lot of bikes!  He sold 300 bikes in total.  Half of those were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes.  That means he sold 150 Trekking bikes and 45 BMX bikes.  The rest were MTB bikes.

To figure out how much money Marcel made, we need to know how many MTB bikes he sold.  He sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, each MTB bike costs $500.  So, Marcel made 105 * $500 = $52,500 from selling MTB bikes.

He also sold 45 BMX bikes at half the price of an MTB, so he made 45 * ($500 / 2) = $11,250 from BMX bikes.

Finally, he sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, making him $150 * $450 = $6,750 from those bikes.

To find the total amount of money Marcel made, we add up all the money he made from each type of bike: $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500.

"To figure out how much paint we need, we need to find the area of all the walls.  

* The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
* The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area is 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
* The total area of all the walls is 80 square feet + 40 square feet = 120 square feet.

We know that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.  So, we need 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons of paint.

Finally, paint costs $12 per gallon, so we need to multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon: 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72.

To find the difference between the number of female guppies and male guppies, we subtract the number of male guppies from the number of female guppies. 

* **Female guppies:** 14
* **Male guppies:** 4

The difference is 14 - 4 = 10. 

To find the difference between the number of female goldfish and male goldfish, we subtract the number of male goldfish from the number of female goldfish.

"Okay, so we know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call that number 'x'.  

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  

We can write that as an equation:  y + (y + 12) = 30

Let's solve for 'y':

* 2y + 12 = 30
* 2y = 18
* y = 9

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. 

Now we know that Arnold and Madeline painted 'x' eggs each.  We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we subtract: 21 - 11 = 10.

**Answer:** Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold.

"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into boxes. Each box can hold 8 crayons and each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  How many pounds of crayons and boxes will he have?

**Answer:** 25 pounds 
 
**Explanation:**

* First, we need to figure out how many boxes Nik can fill. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.
* Then, we need to figure out the total weight of the boxes. 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.
* Finally, we need to add the weight of the crayons to the weight of the boxes. 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.
* We need to convert the total weight of the crayons and boxes to pounds. 200 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 12.5 pounds.

"Let's break this problem down!

* We know the yellow rope is the longest, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use this information:

*  Let's say the yellow rope is 'x' centimeters long.
*  The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

Now, we know all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  So, we can write an equation:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'x':

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long, we can find the length of the red rope:

"Let's break this problem down!

We know that Wendy is five times older than Colin will be in seven years.  That means Wendy's age is 5 times Colin's age plus 7.  

In 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age.  

Let's use these clues to figure out Colin's age now.

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""**

We can write two equations based on the information given:

* **Equation 1:** W = 5(C + 7)  
* **Equation 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, let's solve for C (Colin's current age).

**Step 1: Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2**

Since we know W = 5(C + 7), we can substitute that into Equation 2:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

**Step 2: Simplify and solve for C**

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
* C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
* C + 5 = (5/3)C
* (2/3)C = 5
* C = 25/2

* Now, we know he can buy 100 books for $500.  So, he can buy 100 books / $500 = 2 books per $500.
* To find out how many books he can buy per school, we multiply the number of books per $500 by the money each school gets: 2 books/ $500 * $9000 / 3 schools = 600 books per school.


Answer: 600 books per school.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Start:** We begin with 2 apples falling from the tree.
* **First throw:**  Newton throws one apple back into the tree, causing 5 more to fall.
* **Second throw:**  Newton throws another apple, causing 6 more to fall.

This means that the total number of apples that fall from the tree is 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. 

Newton picks up all the apples that fall from the tree.

"To figure out how many pizzas Kate needs, we need to figure out how many of each kind she needs. 

* **Cheese:** She eats 6 slices of cheese pizza per friend, and she has 6 friends, so she eats 6 * 6 = 36 slices of cheese pizza.
* **Pepperoni:** She eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza per friend, and she has 6 friends, so she eats 4 * 6 = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.

To figure out how many pizzas she needs, we need to figure out how many of each kind she needs. 

* **Cheese:** She needs 36 slices of cheese pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices, so she needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.
* **Pepperoni:** She needs 24 slices of pepperoni pizza, and each pizza has 8 slices, so she needs 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.


**Answer:** Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"Let's break this down!

* We know John was 28 years old when Digimon came out.
*  We also know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out. 

To find Jim's age, we can use this information:

*  Let Jim's age be represented by the variable 'j'.
*  We know that John was twice as old as Jim, so we can write the equation: j = 2 * John's age.
*  We know John's age is 28, so we can substitute that into the equation: j = 2 * 28.
*  Solving for j, we get: j = 56.

**Answer:** Jim is 56 years old.

* Together, they ate 8 + 2 + 3 = 13 slices.

So the answer is 13.

"If eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40, we can solve for the number of mugs. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Let's say we have 'x' number of coffee mugs.
* Four times the number of mugs is 4x.
* Eight more than that is 4x + 8.
* We know this is equal to 40.

So, we can write the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
2. Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

So, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the number of fish with red stripes:**  We know one-third of the fish have red stripes, so we can figure that out by dividing the total number of fish by 3. 66 fish / 3 = 22 fish
* **Find the number of fish that don't have red stripes:**  We can find the number of fish that don't have red stripes by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish. 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish
* **Find the number of fish with blue stripes:**  We know 5 out of 11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.  We can find this by multiplying the number of fish that don't have red stripes by 5/11. 44 fish * (5/11) = 20 fish
* **Find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes:**  To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes. 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish

"The dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.  

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Here's how much water the dehumidifier removes over the three days:

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

The total amount of water removed is 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters**.

"Okay, so Tim has a jar that's 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He wants to figure out how many red jelly beans are in there.  

First, we need to figure out the volume of the jar.  It's a cube, so we multiply the sides: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Now, we need to figure out how many jelly beans are in there.  We know the jelly beans are 0.15 cubic inches each, and the jar is 540 cubic inches.  So, we divide the total volume of the jar by the volume of one jelly bean: 540 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 3600 jelly beans.

But wait!  We need to remember that the jelly beans aren't all red.  We know that 30% of the jelly beans are red.  So, we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 30%: 3600 jelly beans * 0.30 = 1080 jelly beans.

Now, we can find out how many jelly beans are actually red.  We know there are 900 red jelly beans.  So, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans: 3600 - 900 = 2700 jelly beans.

Tim's guess was off by 2700 jelly beans.

"Okay, so the bus started with 20 people. Then it got 40 more people on the first stop.  Then another 3/4 of the people from the first stop got on the bus.  So, 3/4 of 40 people is 30 people.  So, there are 60 people on the bus.  Then, at the third stop, the bus doubled the number of people.  So, there are 180 people on the bus.  To find out how many people are left, we need to subtract the number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity.  The bus has 200 people and 180 people are already on the bus.  So, there are 200 - 180 = 20 people left.

"If the board is 40 feet long, and we want to split it into two pieces, we need to figure out how long each piece is.  

Let's say the shorter piece is 'x'. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x. 

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can write the equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Let's figure out how many cupcakes Carly made!

We know that Carly made a certain number of brownies and cupcakes.  The number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes, minus 2.  

We also know that each person gets 2 treats.  Since there are 5 people in the class, they get a total of 10 treats.

Let's use this information to figure out how many cupcakes Carly made. 

* **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.**
* **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.**

We know:

* **b = 3c - 2** (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know:

* **Each person gets 2 treats.**
* **The class has 5 people.**

Therefore, the total number of treats is: 5 * 2 = 10

**To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:**

* **b + c = 10**  (The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies)

**Now, substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:**

* **(3c - 2) + c = 10**

**Simplify and solve for 'c':**

* **4c - 2 = 10**
* **4c = 12**
* **c = 3**

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

"Okay, so Karen wants a manicure and pedicure, and the salon gives a discount if she gets both.  That's a good deal!  

First, we need to figure out how much the manicure and pedicure cost after the discount.  The manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40.  The discount is 20% of the total price, so we need to multiply the price of the manicure and pedicure by 0.20.  That's $35 + $40 * 0.20 = $35 + $8 = $43.

Now, Karen wants nail art on each of her nails, and that costs $3 per nail.  She has 10 nails, so the nail art will cost $3 * 10 = $30.

Finally, we add up the cost of the manicure and pedicure and the nail art to find the total cost.  The total cost is $43 + $30 = $73.

"Let's break this down!

We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.  We also know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.  We know Samantha has 27 paintings.  

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of paintings Kim has.  

Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can write an equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Now, let's solve for x:

x + 8 - 12 = 27
x - 4 = 27
x = 31

So Kim has 31 paintings.

"Okay, so Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them.  She makes some strawberry cubes, and then she makes blueberry cubes that are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.  How many blueberry cubes does she make?

Here's how to solve it:

* Let's say Mary makes 'x' number of strawberry cubes.

"Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture, he needs 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  He also needs 2 pounds of special honey.  

To figure out how much money he makes, we need to know how much each ingredient costs and how much he sells each jar for.

* Passion fruit costs $6 per pound.
* Jackfruit costs $8 per pound.
* Honey costs $10 per pound.

He sells each jar for $50.

To find out how much he makes, we need to figure out how much it costs to make 10 jars and then how much he sells them for.

* Cost of ingredients for 10 jars: 
    * Passion fruit: 2 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 20 pounds
    * Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 15 pounds
    * Honey: 2 pounds/jar * 10 jars = 20 pounds
    * Total cost: $6/pound * 20 pounds + $8/pound * 15 pounds + $10/pound * 20 pounds = $120 + $120 + $200 = $440
* Total revenue from selling 10 jars: $50/jar * 10 jars = $500
* Profit: $500 - $440 = $60


Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

* **Nickels:** 120 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $6.00
* **Pennies:** 750 pennies * $0.01/penny = $7.50

Now, let's add all those amounts together: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $29.00

So the total amount in the jar is $29.00. 


**Final answer: 29.00**

"Tom's restaurant makes $60 a week. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* They get 6 reservations each night.
* Each night they spend $15 on food (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine).
* Over two nights, they spend $30. 
 
So, they make $60 a week.

"The fruit vendor made a profit of 25% on each watermelon.  To find out how much each watermelon sold for, we need to figure out the selling price. 

* The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
* The profit is 25% of the original price. 
* To find the selling price, we need to add the profit to the original price. 

So, the selling price is $80 + ($80 * 0.25) = $100. 

**Answer:** $100

"Here's how to figure out the youngest son's age in 3 years:

* **James's age:** James is twice as old as Dora, who is turning 12 in 3 years. So, James is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
* **John's age:** John is 32 years old.
* **Youngest son's age:** The youngest son was born when John was 32. In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

**Answer:** 35

"Mark's car broke down, and he needed a new radiator.  The radiator cost $400, but he got it at a junk shop and got a discount!  He saved 80% of the price, which is $320.  Then, a mechanic had to install it, and it took 3 hours.  The mechanic charges $50 an hour, so it cost him $150.  To find the total cost, we add the price of the radiator and the mechanic's labor.  So, the total cost was $320 + $150 = $470. 

**Answer:** $470

"Here's how we can figure out how many chickens Farmer Brown has:

* Let's use variables:
    *  Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
    *  Let 'w' be the number of cows.

* We know:
    *  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
    *  2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

* Let's use the first equation to solve for 'w':
    *  w = 20 - c

* Now, substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:
    *  2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

* Simplify and solve for 'c':
    *  2c + 80 - 4c = 70
    *  -2c = -10
    *  c = 5

* So, there are **5** chickens on the farm.

"If you have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, you need to figure out how many slices are there in total.  So, 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.  Then, you need to divide the total slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person. 

**Answer:** 14
