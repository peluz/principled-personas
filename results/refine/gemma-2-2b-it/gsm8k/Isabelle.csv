"Melanie sold a total of 5 vacuum cleaners.  To find out how many she started with, we need to consider the number she sold at each house. 

Let's break it down:

* **Green House:** She sold 1/3 of her total vacuum cleaners at the green house.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than the green house, so she sold 1/3 + 2 = 5/3 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. 

To find the total number of vacuum cleaners sold, we can use the following equation:

Total sold = (1/3) + (5/3) + (1/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total sold = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can use this information to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners she had. 

Let's use the following equation:

Initial number of vacuum cleaners = Total sold * 2

Initial number of vacuum cleaners = 5/2 * 2 = 5

Therefore, Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms:

18x = 162

Solving for x:

x = 162 / 18 
x = 9

Now that we know x = 9, we can find Allen's age in 10 years:

Allen's age in 10 years = 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  To determine the number of gold coins, we need to consider the relationship between silver and gold coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent this relationship with the following equation:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**

To find the number of silver coins, we can use the total number of coins:

* **Total coins = Silver coins + Gold coins**
* **110 = Silver coins + (Silver coins + 30)**

Simplifying the equation:

* **110 = 2 * Silver coins + 30**
* **80 = 2 * Silver coins**
* **Silver coins = 40**

Now, we can calculate the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**
* **Gold coins = 40 + 30**
* **Gold coins = 70**

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds

Therefore, their combined weight is 623 pounds.

"To determine the number of wins, we need to consider the relationship between wins and losses.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can represent this mathematically as:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**

We know the total number of games played is 22.  Let's represent the number of losses as 'x'.  

* **x + (x + 8) = 22**

Combining like terms:

* **2x + 8 = 22**

Solving for 'x':

* **2x = 14**
* **x = 7**

Therefore, the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we use the formula:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**
* **Wins = 7 + 8 = 15**

**Answer: 15**

"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can use the information given:

* Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
* Their combined sales total 88,000 copies.

Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.  Since Marilyn sold 10x copies, we can set up the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 88,000

Solving for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold **8,000** copies.

"Let's break down this coffee ratio problem.  

We know Katy's coffee recipe uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to figure out the value of one part of this ratio.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.

*  Let's represent the value of one part of the ratio as 'x'. 
*  We can set up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons

Solving for x, we get:
* x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

This means Katy used approximately 17.14 parts of the ratio for her sugar.  

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we can multiply this value by the amount of sugar in the ratio:

* 17.14 parts * 7 teaspoons/part = 120 teaspoons 


 
**Answer:** 17.14 teaspoons

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* **Adrien's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was $40,000.
* **Adrien's salary now:**  His salary increased by 40%, so his salary now is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.
* **Lylah's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30.  Solving for Lylah's salary, we get $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).
* **Lylah's salary now:**  Her salary increased by 40% as well, so her salary now is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).
* **Total salary four years later:**  Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The candy machine has a relationship between pink and blue gumballs that can be represented by the equation:  Pink gumballs = 4 * Blue gumballs + 22.  

Since there are 12 blue gumballs, we can substitute that into the equation: Pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22.

Solving for Pink gumballs: Pink gumballs = 48 + 22 = 70. 

Therefore, there are **70** pink gumballs.

"The hive's population is structured in a specific way.  We know there are 700 bees in total.  

* **Queens:**  The number of queens is represented by the variable 'q'.
* **Baby Bees:** The number of baby bees is represented by the variable 'b'.
* **Worker Bees:** The number of worker bees is represented by the variable 'w'.

We can express the relationship between these variables as follows:

*  w = 2b 
*  b = 2q

To find the number of worker bees, we can use the total bee population:

q + b + w = 700

Substituting the values for 'b' and 'w' from the first two equations:

q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700

Simplifying the equation:

q + 2q + 4q = 700
7q = 700
q = 100

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:

w = 2b = 2 * 2q = 2 * 2 * 100 = 400

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down this problem.  

We know Seth is twice Brooke's age.  This means we can represent their ages with the following equations:

*  S = 2B  (Seth's age is twice Brooke's age)
*  S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use substitution.  Let's substitute S = 2B into the second equation:

* 2B + B + 2 = 28

Combining like terms:

* 3B + 2 = 28

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

* 3B = 26

Dividing both sides by 3:

* B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old. 


**Final answer: 17.34**

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* 60 seconds (first runner) + 3 seconds (second runner) + 3 seconds (third runner) + 3 seconds (fourth runner) = 69 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* 55 seconds (each runner) * 4 runners = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 220 seconds - 69 seconds = 151 seconds.

"To determine the likelihood of rolling a number greater than 3 versus two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each event. 

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**  There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a standard six-sided die.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a standard six-sided die.  The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

The difference in probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%. 


**Answer:**  The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.  The difference is 25%.

* **Rats:** 160 total pieces of straw are used, and 50 pieces are used with hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.
* **Rats per cage:**  We divide the remaining straw by the number of rats to find the number of rats per cage. 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats. 
* **Rat per cage:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, there are **6 rats** in each cage.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for the unknown number of chickens.  Let's break it down:

* **Eggs per day:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Chicken ratio:** The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve for the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.
   * We know: r + w = total chickens
   * We know: 3r + 5w = total eggs

2. **Express one variable in terms of the other:**
   * We know r = w + 2.

3. **Substitute:**
   * Substitute the value of 'r' from step 2 into the first equation: 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

4. **Solve for 'w':**
   * Simplify and solve for 'w': 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   * Combine like terms: 8w + 6 = 42
   * Subtract 6 from both sides: 8w = 36
   * Divide both sides by 8: w = 4.5

5. **Solve for 'r':**
   * Since we can't have half a chicken, there is likely an error in the problem statement. 

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"To calculate the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the fact that their ages will increase by three years. 

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old. Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old. Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 66 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to calculate the total number of spots for each snake type. 

* Cobras have 70 spots each, and there are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots for cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
* Mambas have 35 spots each, and there are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots for mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Finally, to find the total number of spots for all snakes, we add the number of spots for cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  

Therefore, we can solve for 't':

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Dividing both sides by 30 miles/hour, we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business attire, luggage, and a flight ticket.  

To determine how much he can allocate to gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip expenses.

* **Business attire:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Luggage:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight ticket:**  The flight ticket cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500.  Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
* **Total trip expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

Theo has $6000 - $2350 = $3650 remaining for gifts.

"The problem states that people trade 2 old records for 1 new record.  This means the number of old records traded is always a multiple of 2.  

To find the number of old records brought in, we need to consider the number of new records traded.  

* **The total number of new records traded is 7.**
* **Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, we can find the number of people by dividing the total number of new records by the number of records traded per person.**

**Therefore, the number of people who traded records is 7 / 2 = 3.5.  This is not a whole number, so there is an error in the problem setup.**

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate than Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:**
    * Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
    * Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
    * Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Answer:** Job B offers a net pay rate of $8,400 more than Job A.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the three groups is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x' in the equation:** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.**

* **Let's represent the number of chickens with 'c' and the number of cows with 'w'.**
* **We know that the total number of animals is 60:**  c + w = 60
* **We also know that there are twice as many chickens as cows:** c = 2w

**Solving for the variables:**

1. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:** 2w + w = 60
2. **Combine like terms:** 3w = 60
3. **Solve for 'w' by dividing both sides by 3:** w = 20
4. **Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 2w to find 'c':** c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculating the total number of legs:**

* **Chickens have 2 legs each:** 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs
* **Cows have 4 legs each:** 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* **Total legs:** 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

"To determine Tyson's total distance for June, we need to consider his daily mileage and the number of training days in June. 

* **Daily Mileage:** Tyson runs 5000 meters per day.
* **Increased Mileage:** His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is an additional 5000 meters * (1/5) = 1000 meters per day.
* **Total Mileage for June:**  He runs 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters per day.
* **Total Distance for June:**  He trains for 30 days in June, so his total distance is 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.  

To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval:

Number of days between services = Total distance traveled / Service interval

Number of days between services = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.375 service intervals.

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

For the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"To determine the difference in popsicles between Betty and Sam, we can utilize the ratio of their popsicles.  

The ratio 5:6 represents a proportion of popsicles, meaning that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

The total number of popsicles they have is 165.  To find the value of one ratio part, we can divide the total popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

* **Solving for x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:
   x = $100 / $1.50 = 66.67

Since we need a whole number of cards, we round this to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Indras' name:**  Has 6 letters.
* **Sister's name:** Has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.

"To determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce, we need to consider the relationship between the number of dragons slain by each prince. 

* Prince Thaddeus's slaying of 100 dragons serves as our baseline.
* Prince Arthur, with a spear, slayed 75 dragons, representing three-quarters of Prince Thaddeus's total.
* Prince Walter, wielding an iron axe, slayed twice the number of dragons as Arthur, equaling 150 dragons.
* Prince Bruce, lacking a sword, used a nail file to slay 30 dragons, which is one-fifth the number slain by Prince Walter.

Therefore, Prince Bruce's slaying of 30 dragons is the answer.

* **Solve for the width:** 360 = 9 * width, so width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.
* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).  Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To determine the difference in beads between the sisters, we need to consider the number of beads each sister has. 

* Elizabeth has 3 packs of clear beads and 1 pack of red beads, totaling 3 + 1 = 4 packs of beads.
* Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, totaling 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

The difference in the number of beads is calculated as follows:

* Margareth has 7 packs * 20 pieces/pack = 140 pieces of beads.
* Elizabeth has 4 packs * 20 pieces/pack = 80 pieces of beads.

The difference in beads is 140 - 80 = 60 pieces. 

Therefore, Margareth has 60 more beads than Elizabeth.

"The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees from the oven's heating.  After the window is opened, the temperature decreases by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes.  To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after the oven has been on for 3 hours. 

The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.  The temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, so the temperature increases by 5 degrees/hour * 180 minutes = 900 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 30/10 = 3 degrees.

The final temperature is 40 degrees + 900 degrees - 3 degrees = 937 degrees. 

**Final answer: 937**

* **James's Swim:** James is 10% faster than Jon, so his swim time is 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* **James's Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.
* **James's Run:**  We know Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James's run time is 160 - 10 = 150 minutes. 

**Answer:** James took 150 minutes to complete the run.

* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat **6** carrot sticks.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = (Number of strawberry gum packs) * (Price per pack)

We know the total cost is $7.00 and the number of strawberry gum packs is 2.  We can solve for the price per pack:

$7.00 = 2 * Price per pack

Price per pack = $7.00 / 2 = $3.50

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.50.

"Frederick can maximize his popsicle stick production by purchasing the most cost-effective lumber.  

Here's how to determine the optimal solution:

* **Cost per stick:**  The 2x4 wood costs $4 for 200 sticks, resulting in a cost of $0.02 per stick. The 2x8 wood costs $6 for 400 sticks, resulting in a cost of $0.015 per stick.

* **Optimal wood choice:**  The 2x4 wood is the more economical choice, as it provides the most sticks for the least amount of money.

* **Maximum sticks:**  To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate how many 2x4 pieces he can purchase with his $24 budget. 

* **Calculation:** $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces of 2x4 wood.

* **Total sticks:** 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 popsicle sticks.

To find the total number of animals at the farm and zoo, we add the number of animals on each farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals at the farm and zoo is 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Rose's onions : Sophia's onions = Rose's potatoes : Sophia's potatoes

* 12 : Sophia's onions = 4 : Sophia's potatoes

To find Sophia's onions, we can solve for Sophia's onions by dividing both sides of the proportion by 4:

* Sophia's onions = 12 / 4 = 3

Now, we can find Sophia's potatoes by using the same proportion:

* Sophia's potatoes = 4 * Sophia's onions

* Sophia's potatoes = 4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 12 potatoes.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar contains a specific ratio of red, blue, and green jelly beans.  

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent this as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can represent this as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent this as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

To find the value of 'b', we divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

Now, let's find the difference in green and red jelly beans:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000 with an additional $500 for a porcelain crown.  His initial deposit is $600.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown.  The total cost of the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.  The total cost of the implants with the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

"Jim has a 20-pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the total number of legs and heads. 

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know the following:

* **Equation 1: 4s + 2g = 70**  (Each sheep has 4 legs, each goose has 2, and the total is 70)
* **Equation 2: s + g = 20** (The total number of heads is 20)

To solve for 's', we can use a method called substitution.  

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

"The regulation passed with a majority of votes.  Since there were twice as many votes in favor as against the regulation, we can represent the number of votes in favor as 2x, where x is the number of votes against the regulation.  

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

"Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the difference in earnings, we need to calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours and then subtract Sally's earnings for the same hours. 

* Billy's hourly rate after the first raise: $10.50
* Billy's hourly rate after his anniversary: $11.50
* Billy's earnings for 20 hours: 20 hours * $11.50/hour = $230.00
* Sally's starting salary: $10.50
* Sally's earnings for 20 hours: 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.00

Therefore, Billy's earnings are $230.00 and Sally's earnings are $210.00. The difference is $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00.

"Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we need to work our way up the chain of strength.  

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.  Therefore, Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

"To ensure we have enough jello for all the kids, Greg needs to purchase 12 boxes of flavored jello.  Each box makes 10 small jello cups, so he'll need 12 boxes * 10 jello cups/box = 120 jello cups.  Since each kid needs 4 jello cups, he'll need enough jello for 30 kids * 4 jello cups/kid = 120 jello cups.  The jello is currently on sale for $1.25 per box, so Greg will spend 12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15.00 on jello.

"To determine the cost of David's purchase, we can use the following logic:

* **Soda Cost:**  A single bottle of soda costs $3.00.  
* **Water Cost:** A single bottle of water costs $2.00.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be three times her current age, we can use a simple algebraic equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take.  We know:

* Melanie's age in 'x' years: 8 + x
* Her age will be thrice her present age: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for 'x':
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"Kelly's grocery shopping trip is going to be a bit tight! Let's break down the costs:

* **Bacon:** 5 packs at $10 total means each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

* **Strawberries:** 3 packs at $4 each cost $4 * 3 = $12.
* **Apples:** 7 packs at $2 each cost $2 * 7 = $14.

The total cost of all the items is $2 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $52.

Kelly has $65 to spend, and her total cost is $52.  She has $65 - $52 = $13 left in her budget.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Answer:** 55 meters per second 

**Explanation:**

To find the speed of a whirligig, we need to consider the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second.  Therefore, the whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, and we can calculate the whirligig's speed by multiplying the thingamabob's speed by 5.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John.  To find Peter's age, we need to use a system of equations.

* Let's represent Peter's age as ""P""
* Paul's age is ""P + 10""
* John's age is ""J""

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. **Equation 1:** P + P + J = 100 (The sum of their ages is 100)
2. **Equation 2:** P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Solving for John's age (J) in Equation 2:

* P = P + 10 + J
* Subtract P from both sides: 0 = 10 + J
* Solve for J: J = -10

This result doesn't make sense in the context of age.  It's impossible for someone to have a negative age.  Let's re-examine the problem.

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information and apply algebraic equations. 

Let's represent the points scored by each individual:

* **Dinar:**  Let's represent Dinar's score as D.
* **Azibo:**  Let's represent Azibo's score as A.
* **Bahati:**  Let's represent Bahati's score as B.

We know the following:

* **B = A + 20**  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* **B = D + 10** (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* **A + D + B = 45** (The total points)

We can use these equations to solve for A. 

**Step 1: Substitute to eliminate B**

Since we know B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:

* D + 10 = A + 20

**Step 2: Solve for A**

* A = D - 10

**Step 3: Substitute into the total points equation**

Now, substitute this value of A back into the total points equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

**Step 4: Simplify and solve for D**

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35 / 3

"Kim's sleep duration can be calculated by subtracting the time spent awake from the total sleep time.  

* **Sleep time:** 
    *  She woke up at 6:00 am, and went to sleep at 10:00 pm. 
    *  This means she slept for 16 hours (10:00 pm to 6:00 am). 
* **Time spent awake:**
    *  She was sleepwalking from 2:15 am to 2:38 am. 
    *  She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she slept for 18 minutes. 

**Therefore, Kim slept for 16 hours - 18 minutes = 15 hours and 42 minutes.**

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.  To determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to consider the daily admissions and the current occupancy. 

Here's how to calculate the number of unoccupied beds:

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial occupancy:** 1000 beds * (1/5) = 200 occupied beds
* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks:** 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients
* **Step 3: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:** 700 patients
* **Step 4: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds:** 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 unoccupied beds

Therefore, after 2 weeks, the hospital will have **300** unoccupied beds.

"Jen's travel expenses are comprised of two components: supplies and travel.  The supplies cost $400.  To determine the cost of travel, we need to consider that the travel cost is 50% more than the supplies.  

Let's represent the cost of travel as ""x"".  The cost of travel is calculated as follows:

* Travel cost = x = 1.50 * Supplies cost

Since the supplies cost is $400, we can substitute that into the equation:

"Let's break down the Pokemon catching situation!

We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can use this information to figure out how many each of them caught.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * We can use the first two equations to help us find Stan's catch.  Let's substitute the first equation into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Teresa's pricing strategy is a classic example of a markup.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Large Stuffed Animals:**  She sells each large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small stuffed animal.
* **Small Stuffed Animals:** She sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large stuffed animals.
* **Earnings:** Her total earnings are $120.

To find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we can use the following steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   * Since she sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sells 2x small stuffed animals.

2. **Set up the Equation:**
   * The earnings from large stuffed animals are 12x (price per large stuffed animal * number of large stuffed animals).
   * The earnings from small stuffed animals are 4 * 2x = 8x.
   * The total earnings are the sum of these two: 12x + 8x = $120

3. **Solve for x:**
   * Combine like terms: 20x = $120
   * Divide both sides by 20: x = 6

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Marcus has a 80% chance of needing to turn in his homework tomorrow. 

Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%
* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

"Let's break down the problem:

*  We know the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.
*  Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.

To find the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the time Donovan spent on the meal.
*  Betsy's portion took 'x + 18' minutes.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

*  x + (x + 18) = 98

Solving for 'x':

*  2x + 18 = 98
*  2x = 80
*  x = 40

This means Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

* Mark ate 4 sandwiches.
* Sidney ordered 3 more sandwiches.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs is 7 * 4 + 3 * 4 = 28 + 12 = 40.

"Let's break down this fence problem.  

We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Harry has.

* **Let's represent Sam's fencing as 'x' feet.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet.**

The total fencing is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

This means Sam has 20 feet of fencing.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fencing from the total:

* 100 - 80 = 20

**Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing left over.**

"The biggest slide at Five Flags is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet per minute.  To determine the difference in ride time, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each slide.

For the biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in ride time is: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"The problem states that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and 6 jellyfish changed color in total.  To find the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following logic:

* **Large jellyfish:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of jellyfish. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we know x/5 = the number of large jellyfish.
* **Change color:**  We know 6 jellyfish changed color, and a third of the large jellyfish change color, so 6 = (1/3) * x.
* **Solve for x:**  Solving for x in the second equation, we get 6 = (1/3) * x, which means x = 6 * 3 = 18. 
* **Total jellyfish:**  Therefore, there are 18 large jellyfish, and since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, there are 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to consider her savings rate and retirement goals. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Savings Rate:** Lauren saves 20% of her annual income.
* **Retirement Goal:** She aims to save for 20 years.
* **Living Expenses:** She plans to live on 40% of her current salary.

**Calculating the Savings Needed:**

To determine how much she needs to save, we need to consider her annual savings and the total amount she needs to accumulate over 20 years.

* **Annual Savings:** Lauren saves $20,000 per year.
* **Total Savings Needed:**  She needs to save $1,200,000 over 20 years.

"To determine the time required for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we can use the following:

* **Blinks per minute:** The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, giving us a rate of 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks/minute.

* **Time to blink 459 times:** To find the time, we divide the desired number of blinks (459) by the blinking rate (51): 459 blinks / 51 blinks/minute = 9 minutes.


Therefore, it will take the light **9 minutes** to blink 459 times.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  
* We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. 
* To find the number of eggs each person painted, we can use a system of equations.

Let's represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted with 'x'.  We can then represent the number of eggs Sarah painted with 'y'.

*  We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. This can be represented as: y + 12 = Camden's eggs.
*  We also know that the total number of eggs painted is 56. This can be represented as: x + x + y + y + 12 = 56.

Now, let's solve for the number of eggs each person painted. 

*  We can simplify the equation: 2x + 2y + 12 = 56
*  We can then solve for y: 2y = 56 - 2x - 12
*  We can simplify this further: 2y = 44 - 2x
*  We can then solve for y: y = 22 - x

*  We know that x + x = 2x.  We can substitute this into the equation for y: y = 22 - x. 
*  We can then solve for x: x = 11.

*  We can now substitute the value of x back into the equation for y: y = 22 - 11 = 11.

*  We know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so Camden painted 11 + 12 = 23 eggs.

*  We can now find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs: 23 - 11 = 12.

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons and boxes:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound. 

* **Total weight in pounds:** 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds


**Answer:** 25 pounds

"Grandma walks 3 miles each day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  The sidewalk is twice as long as the beach, so she walks at a faster pace.  To find the total time, we need to consider the time spent on each section.

* **Beach walking time:**  She walks 2 miles at a rate of 3 miles per day / 2 miles = 1.5 miles per hour.
* **Sidewalk walking time:** She walks 1 mile at twice the speed of the beach, so she walks 1 mile / 1.5 miles per hour = 0.67 hours.
* **Total time:** The total time for the entire walk is 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours.
* **Total time in minutes:** The total time for the entire walk is 2/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 40 minutes.

"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we need to consider his consumption pattern. 

* **Step 1: Calculate total eggs consumed in the first 30 days:** Chester eats 3 eggs per day for 30 days, resulting in 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

* **Step 2: Calculate total eggs consumed in the second 30 days:**  He then increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day for another 30 days, consuming 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

* **Step 3: Calculate total eggs consumed:**  Chester consumes a total of 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

* **Step 4: Calculate the number of dozens:**  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Chester needs 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

"To determine the number of seashells each person receives, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Carlos's Seashells:**  We know Jim collected 27 seashells, and this was 5 more than Carlos's collection.  Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
* **Carrey's Seashells:**  Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.  This means Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.
* **Total Seashells:**  Together, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.
* **Equally Divided:**  To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total seashells by the number of people: 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"An avocado tree's fruit production follows a clear pattern.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree produces 50 fruits per year, totaling 250 fruits.
* **Year 6:**  The tree produces 3 times the initial production, so it yields 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:**  The tree produces 7 times the initial production, resulting in 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:**  The tree produces 150 fruits, which is 200 less than the production of a 10-year-old tree.
* **Year 9:**  The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:**  The tree produces 1000 fruits, which is 20 times the initial production.

To calculate the total fruit production, we need to sum the production for each year: 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = **2250 fruits**.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can set up an equation to solve for the length of the yellow rope:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  To find the length of the red rope, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

* **Rissa's remaining amount:**  After giving away $3, Rissa has $15 - $3 = $12.
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** Ronnie had $5.
* **Amount given away:**  Ronnie gave away the same amount as Rissa, so she gave away $3.
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:**  After giving away $3, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step-by-step. 

* **Initial Amount:** Thomas starts with 50 $20 bills, totaling $1000.
* **Loss:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* **Bill Usage:** He uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill, leaving him with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* **Tripling:**  He triples his remaining money, which is 20 * 3 = 60.
* **Conversion:**  He converts all his bills to $5 bills.  

To find the number of $5 bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 60 / 5 = 12.

"The teacher needs to recycle the chalk after using 2 inches of chalk.  To figure out how many days he has left, we need to consider the amount of chalk he uses each day. 

* **Calculate the chalk used on Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the chalk, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.
* **Calculate the chalk remaining:** Since he used 2.25 times the amount of chalk, he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk he normally uses left.
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He has 0.44 times the amount of chalk left, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"James has 30 teeth.  The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills.  To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than James drills, so they cap 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.  The dentist fixes a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.  To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100%. This gives us (15/30) * 100% = 50%.  Therefore, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

"Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon, totaling $14,000.  However, he returned 2/5 of the milk due to spoilage, which amounted to 1600 gallons.  

To calculate the refund amount, we need to determine the cost of the spoiled milk.  The cost of the spoiled milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600.  

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $14,000 - $5,600 = $8,400.

"Colin is currently 12.5 years old. 

**Explanation:**

We can solve this problem using a system of equations. Let's represent Colin's current age as 'C' and Wendy's current age as 'W'.  

* **Equation 1:** W = 5(C + 7)  
* **Equation 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

We can substitute the value of W from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Simplifying and solving for C:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
* C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
* C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
* (2/3)C = -5
* C = -5 * (3/2)
* C = -15/2

Since age cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations. Let's re-examine the problem.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removed, we need to consider the time spent on each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters

"The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  To find the length of the longer piece, we need to know the length of the shorter piece.  

Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Carly is making brownies and cupcakes for her art class.
* We need to find the number of cupcakes she made.

We can use the following equation to represent the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes:

*  *b = 3c - 2* 

This equation tells us that the number of brownies (b) is equal to three times the number of cupcakes (c) minus 2.

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation. We know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person gets 2 treats.

*  *b + c = 10*

Let's substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* *(3c - 2) + c = 10*

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* *4c - 2 = 10*
* *4c = 12*
* *c = 3*

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

Emma's age = x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to consider his total spending.  

First, we know Ryan earns $18 from his chores.  Then, he spends $3.75 on ice cream for himself and his friends.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. 

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
