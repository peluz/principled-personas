"Melanie sold a total of 5 vacuum cleaners, and she has 5 left.  To determine the initial number of vacuum cleaners, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners.**
* **Sales at the green house:**  x/3
* **Sales at the red house:** (x/3) + 2
* **Sales at the orange house:** (x/3) + (x/3) + 2 = (2x/3) + 2
* **Total sales:** (x/3) + (x/3) + 2 + (2x/3) + 2 = 5

Solving for x, we get:

* **5 = (x/3) + (x/3) + 2 + (2x/3) + 2**
* **5 = (6x/3) + 4**
* **5 = 2x + 4**

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen.  

Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can use a simple algebraic equation.  Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is represented as 110.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

"To determine the number of wins, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let 'x' represent the number of games lost.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of wins as 'x + 8'.  The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses, so we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Solving for 'x', we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 7.  Therefore, the team won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's. This means Gerald's time is the baseline, and Lee's time is 2 seconds greater.
* **Calculating Gerald's Improvement:**  Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. This is a percentage increase, which we can use to calculate his new time.
* **Setting up the Equation:**  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation to represent Gerald's new time:
   * Gerald's new time = Original time + (10% of Original time)
   * Gerald's new time = x + 0.1x 
   * We know x is Gerald's original time.

* **Solving for x:**  We can substitute the value of x into the equation:
   * Gerald's new time = x + 0.1x
   * Gerald's new time = 36 + 0.1(36)
   * Gerald's new time = 36 + 3.6
   * Gerald's new time = 39.6 seconds

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

To find Lylah's salary, we need to consider the relationship between their salaries.  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

* Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30

We can solve for Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30:

* Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later:

* Lylah's salary now = $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

* Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300

**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is represented by 'S' and Brooke's age is represented by 'B'.
* We are given that S = 2B, meaning Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* The sum of their ages in two years will be 28.

To find Seth's current age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = 2B, we can substitute this into the equation: 2B + B + 2 = 28
2. **Combine:** Combine the 'B' terms: 3B + 2 = 28
3. **Isolate B:** Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
4. **Solve for B:** Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"The provided problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to model a real-world situation.  Let's break down the problem and apply a systematic approach to find the solution.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We are given that Jerry has a flock of chickens, and we need to determine the number of red chickens.  The problem provides us with the following information:

* **Egg Production:** Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
* **Total Eggs Collected:** Jerry collects 42 eggs each day.
* **Chicken Ratio:** There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

**Solving the Problem:**

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'.

* **Equation 1:**  3r + 5w = 42 (Total eggs produced)
* **Equation 2:** r = w + 2 (Number of white chickens is two more than red chickens)

**Solving for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

1. **Substitute:**  Since we know 'r' is equal to 'w + 2', we can substitute this into Equation 1:
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

2. **Simplify and Solve:**
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5

3. **Check for Validity:**  We cannot have half a chicken. This indicates that there is an error in the problem statement. 

**Conclusion:**

The provided problem has an inconsistency. It's impossible to have a number of chickens that results in a fractional number of eggs.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
   * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, resulting in a total loss of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   * The big pool now has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   * We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This translates to the equation: 8x = 4(x - 16).

* **Solve for x:**
   * 8x = 4x - 64
   * 4x = -64
   * x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which indicates an error in the problem setup.  

**Therefore, the problem is inconsistent and cannot be solved as written.** 



**Final answer:**  The problem is inconsistent and cannot be solved as written.

"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the impact of age progression. 

* **Harriet's Age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's Age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's Age:**  Zack is half of Harriet's age, making him 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

**Calculating the Average:**  In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old. Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old. Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old.

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5 years.

"Sam is currently 6 years old. This can be determined by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let R represent Ruby's current age and S represent Sam's current age. We know:

* R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use a strategic approach.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Total Players:** The team has 105 members in total.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, meaning the offense has 2 * x players.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning the special teams have x/2 players.

We can express this information mathematically:

x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams) = 105

Combining like terms:

(7/2)x + x = 105

Simplifying:

(9/2)x = 105

Solving for x:

x = 105 * (2/9) = 25

Therefore, there are **25** players on the defense.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

"The train's operational requirements are straightforward.  To determine the service interval, we need to consider the total distance traveled per day.  

The train travels 225 miles for each trip, and it completes three trips per day.  Therefore, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips = 675 miles.

The service interval is set at 18,000 miles.  To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train requires service every **27 days**.

"Let's break down the triathlon times:

* **Jon's Time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 70 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 160 minutes
* **James's Swim:**  Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James is 10% faster, so his swim time is 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* **James's Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 70 minutes + 5 minutes = 75 minutes.
* **James's Run:**  To find James's run time, we need to consider the time difference between Jon and James. Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James took 10 minutes longer than Jon. 

Therefore, James's run time is 109 minutes.

"The remoras, being ectoparasites, are a common feature of sharks.  Their attachment to the shark's body is a symbiotic relationship, with the remoras benefiting from the shark's movement and the shark gaining a source of food.  

To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we can calculate the ratio of their combined length to the shark's total length. 

The remoras' combined length is 72 inches, and the shark's total length is 120 inches.  Therefore, the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras is:

Solving for x:

1. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 3x - 80 = x
2. Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
3. Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

"To determine the optimal number of guests for a cost-effective surprise party, we need to analyze the cost structure of each venue. 

Let's break down the costs:

* **Venue 1:**  A flat fee of $200 is charged regardless of the number of guests.  However, food costs an additional $5 per guest.
* **Venue 2:**  The cost is a fixed price per guest, with food already included.

To find the point where the costs are equal, we need to set the two equations equal to each other:

*  $200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

Solving for the number of guests:

* $200 = $20 * number of guests
* number of guests = 10

Therefore, for the two venues to be equal in cost, **10 guests** are required.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we can break down the problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Solving for x:
* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects:
* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

* Twice the rug's width is 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet.
* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, so the couch is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet long.

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"Suzie's purchase can be analyzed by considering the cost of the strawberry gum and the remaining funds.  We know she spent $5 on other gum, and this cost is comprised of the green apple gum and the grape gum.  

To determine the cost of the strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = Cost of strawberry gum + Cost of other gum

We can then solve for the cost of the strawberry gum:

Cost of strawberry gum = Total cost - Cost of other gum

Substituting the known values:

Cost of strawberry gum = $7 - $5 = $2. 

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem using a strategic approach.  

We know the jar contains a specific ratio of jelly beans.  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  

* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can represent them as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent them as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 2.99b = 4500.  

Solving for 'b', we find b = 1500.  

Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* **Green jelly beans:** 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* **Red jelly beans:** 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago, which is a key factor in determining his current age.  We can express this relationship as:

* **Current Age = 2 * (Age Five Years Ago)**

To find Jerry's age in three years, we need to consider his current age and add three to it. 

* **Age in Three Years = Current Age + 3**

Let's calculate Jerry's age in three years:

* **Age in Three Years = 2 * (Age Five Years Ago) + 3**

To find the age five years ago, we can use the current age. 

* **Age Five Years Ago = Current Age / 2**

Let's substitute the current age into the equation for age five years ago.

* **Age Five Years Ago = 10 / 2 = 5**

Now we can calculate Jerry's age in three years.

* **Age in Three Years = 2 * 5 + 3 = 13**

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 per implant * 2 implants = $4000. The additional cost of the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the total cost of the dental work. His hourly wage is $15 per hour.  Therefore, the number of hours he needs to work is $4500 / $15 per hour = 300 hours.

"The angles in a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This can be expressed as s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplify and solve for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g to find 's': s = 20 - 5 => s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach.  

We know Janey has 3 more books than twice the number Sally has.  This translates to the following equation: 2 * Sally's books + 3 = Janey's books.

We are given that Janey has 21 books.  Let's substitute this into the equation: 2 * Sally's books + 3 = 21.

"Based on the established relationship between potatoes and hash browns, we can determine the number of hash browns produced from 96 potatoes.  

The key is understanding the proportionality.  If 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

Therefore, to find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6 * x = 36 * 96
* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

* **Cookie Monster's cookies:** Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the optimal oil quantity for Tanya's salt scrub.

**Understanding the Ratios:**

* **Zest and Fragrance:** Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, meaning they are equal.
* **Salt and Zest:**  Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest.
* **Oil and Salt:** Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.

**Solving for the Variables:**

To find the amount of oil, we need to understand the relationship between the quantities of salt, zest, and oil.  

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  x = fragrance
    *  y = 2x 
    *  o = 2y
    *  y = z 
    *  10 ounces = x + y + z + o

**Finding the Amount of Oil (o):**

*  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
*  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
*  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x

**Determining the Amount of Oil:**

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to analyze the relationship between the number of cards each individual possesses. 

Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.  Smendrick has 3 times this amount, so he has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical trend.  We can analyze this by breaking down his production over the first three weeks:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars

To determine the production for week 4, we need to consider the total production for the first three weeks.  

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find the production for week 4, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"The installation cost for Angela's project is straightforward.  We can break it down as follows:

* **Mirrors:**  Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation is $529.00.

"Roy's savings are calculated based on a percentage increase relative to Anthony's savings.  We know Anthony saved $30.00, and Roy saved 40% more than Anthony.  To calculate Roy's savings, we can use the following formula:

Roy's Savings = Anthony's Savings * (1 + Percentage Increase)

Let's plug in the values:

Roy's Savings = $30.00 * (1 + 0.40)

Roy's Savings = $30.00 * 1.40

Roy's Savings = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has $42.00 saved.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We can determine this by analyzing the relationships between the individuals' abilities.

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. This means Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.  Therefore, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  This means Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"The rink has a vibrant yellow hue, and it's no surprise they have a considerable number of them!  To determine the exact count, we need to consider the total number of cars and the relationships between the colors. 

* **Red:** 12
* **Green:** 10
* **Blue:** 30

The total number of cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

"To determine the number of books Fawn possesses, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as ""F"".  We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  

* **Sofie's books:** F - 12 + 25
* **Anne's books:** F - 12

Therefore, the total number of books can be represented as: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F: 
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the initial cost of the chickens, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens sold. 

* **Profit:** Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** Each chicken is sold for $50.
* **Number of Chickens Sold:** Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

To calculate the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the selling price: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Subtracting the profit from the total revenue, we can determine the initial cost: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias must have purchased the chickens for $7000.

"The problem states that Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade and the boys sold an equal number.  To find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales, we need to determine the number of glasses Micah sold.  Since the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can calculate the number of glasses Micah sold by subtracting Julie's sales from the total number of glasses sold. 

Therefore, Micah sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  

To determine the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.  This gives us 14 - 18 = -4.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Paul's age is 'P + 10'
    * John's age is 'J'

* **Formulate equations:**
    * The combined age is 100:  P + (P + 10) + J = 100

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A + 20 = D + 10
* A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in cooperative game theory.  We can solve this by considering the distribution of chips.  

* **Let's denote the number of chips each of the three individuals receives as:**
    *  *x* = the number of chips received by the first two individuals
    *  *y* = the number of chips received by the third individual

* **We know that:**
    * *x* + *y* = 140 (the total number of chips received by Amora and Lainey)
    * *x* = *y* + 15 (the third individual receives 15 more chips than the first two)

* **Solving for *x* and *y*:**
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: *y* + 15 + *y* = 140
    * Combine like terms: 2*y* + 15 = 140
    * Subtract 15 from both sides: 2*y* = 125
    * Divide both sides by 2: *y* = 62.5
    * Substitute the value of *y* back into the equation *x* = *y* + 15: *x* = 62.5 + 15 = 77.5

* **Therefore, the total number of chips is:**
    * *x* + *y* + *x* = 77.5 + 62.5 + 77.5 = 217.5

**Answer:** 217.5

"Let's break down the Pokemon-catching puzzle!

We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a combined total of 339 Pokemon.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

* **A = S + 5:**  Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
* **S = 4W - 13:** Stan has 13 fewer Pokemon than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.
* **A + S + W = 339:**  The total number of Pokemon caught by all three.

To find Stan's catch, we need to isolate 'S' in the first equation:

* **S = A - 5**

Now, substitute this value of 'S' into the third equation:

* **(A - 5) + A + W = 339**

Simplify the equation:

* **2A - 5 + W = 339**

We know Adelwolfe caught 41 Pokemon (rounded to the nearest whole number). Substitute this value into the equation:

* **2A - 5 + 41 = 339**

Solve for 'A':

* **2A + 36 = 339**
* **2A = 303**
* **A = 151.5**

Now, substitute the value of 'A' back into the equation **S = A - 5** to find Stan's catch:

* **S = 151.5 - 5**
* **S = 146.5**

Since we can't have half a Pokemon, we round this number to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, Stan has caught 146 Pokemon.**

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three legs: a southward flight, a northward flight, and a final southward flight.  

* **Southward Flight:** The bird travels 300 miles south at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 10 hours. 
* **Northward Flight:** The bird then flies 36 miles north at a speed of 18 miles per hour for 2 hours.
* **Southward Flight:** Finally, the bird flies 110 miles south at a speed of 22 miles per hour for 5 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances of each leg. 

**Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles**

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the net increase in his earnings. 

* **Income increase:** Jim's degree increases his annual income by $75,000, a 3-fold increase from his previous $25,000 salary.
* **Total income during college:** Over four years, he earns $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.
* **Total loan payments:** He pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000 in loans.
* **Total lost income:**  He loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Net income increase:**  Jim's net income increase is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year.

To calculate the time to recoup his losses, we need to determine how many years it takes to earn $300,000.

"To determine the share of the first person, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let's represent the shares as follows:

*  Let 'x' be the amount the first person received.
*  The second person received x + $80.
*  The third person received 2(x + $80).

The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

(4x + $160) / 3 = $1920

Solving for x:

4x + $160 = $5760
4x = $5600
x = $1400

Therefore, the first person received $1400.

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  To calculate the value in 2010, we need to consider the depreciation rate and the initial value. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.  

The value in 2010 is calculated as follows:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"Let's analyze the problem.  We know the total cooking time was 98 minutes.  We also know that Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  

To find the duration of Donovan's portion, we can use the following equation:

* Donovan's portion time = x 

Betsy's portion time is then:

* Betsy's portion time = x + 18

The total time is the sum of both portions:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

* 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for x:

* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.  Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down this fence problem using a simple linear equation.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.
*  Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 60) = 100

Solving for 'x', we get:
2x + 60 = 100
2x = 40
x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's share from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.

*  2x + (2y + 12) = 56 (The total number of eggs painted is 56)

**Solving for y (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

*  2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  2y = 44 - 2x
*  y = 22 - x

**Solving for x (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

*  We know that x + x = 2x
*  We also know that y = 22 - x
*  Substitute the value of y into the equation: 22 - x + x = 2x
*  Simplify: 22 = 2x
*  Solve for x: x = 11

**Solving for Camden's eggs:**

*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Camden painted 22 - 11 + 12 = 23 eggs

**Finding the difference:**

*  Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.
*  The difference is 23 - 11 = 12

**Answer:** Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"The yellow rope, with a length of 'x' centimeters, forms the basis for our analysis.  The blue rope, 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, is represented by 'x - 7' centimeters.  The red rope, four times the length of the blue rope, is calculated as '4(x - 7)' centimeters.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  Therefore, we can express this as an equation:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37

Solving for 'x':

6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which is 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"For a standard medical dosage, Saanvi requires a precise combination of two medications.  The first medication is administered at a volume of 14 mL, and the second medication is administered in a three-fold quantity, meaning it is three times the volume of the first medication.  

To determine the total volume of medication in 8 doses, we can calculate the total volume per dose and then multiply that by the number of doses. 

The total volume per dose is 14 mL + (3 * 14 mL) = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Therefore, the total volume of medication in 8 doses is 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.

"Tim's estimation is off by 36 jelly beans.  

**Explanation:**

To determine the accuracy of Tim's guess, we need to consider the packing efficiency and the volume of the jelly beans.  

* **Packing Efficiency:**  The 80% packing efficiency accounts for the space occupied by the jelly beans within the jar. 
* **Volume Calculation:**  The volume of the jar is calculated by multiplying the side length by itself and the height. 
* **Jelly Bean Volume:** The volume of the jelly beans is calculated by dividing the total volume of the jar by the volume per jelly bean. 
* **Estimating the Number of Jelly Beans:**  The number of jelly beans is determined by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we can use a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes and 'b' represent the number of brownies.  

We know that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by the equation:

* b = 3c - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person receives 2 treats.  Therefore:

* c + b = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

* c + (3c - 2) = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between strawberry and blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation:

6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

6x = 120
x = 20

This means Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.  

The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as:

5 * 20 - 4 = 96

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn popping pattern.  The initial burst of popping is due to the rapid heating of the kernels, followed by a period of exponential growth.  The rate of popping then slows down as the kernels reach a peak.  The final 30 seconds of popping represent a diminishing rate, and the residual heat will continue to pop kernels for a short period. 

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to calculate the total number of kernels popped in each stage:

* **Stage 1:** 20 kernels
* **Stage 2:** 3 * 20 = 60 kernels
* **Stage 3:** 4 * 60 = 240 kernels
* **Stage 4:** 240 kernels / 2 = 120 kernels

The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels.

The residual heat will pop an additional 30 kernels.

Therefore, Garrett has a total of 440 + 30 = **470** kernels to eat.

"The average of Mia and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

2x + 16 = 96

2x = 80

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

"To determine the number of chickens, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
