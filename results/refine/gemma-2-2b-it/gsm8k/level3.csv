"Let's break down the problem using the properties of multiplication and addition:

* **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times the sheep of Seattle, who has 20.  This can be represented as 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice the sheep of Charleston, which has 80.  This can be represented as 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* **Total sheep:** To find the total number of sheep across all three cities, we add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

"The download process is interrupted by a system update, requiring a restart.  This is a common scenario, and the impact on the overall download time is straightforward to calculate.

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Initial Download:** Carla's initial download is 80 GB, and it takes 40 minutes to complete.
2. **Restart:** The system update requires a 20-minute restart.
3. **Remaining Download:** The remaining download is 120 GB.

**Calculating the Total Download Time:**

* **Time spent on the initial download:** 40 minutes
* **Time spent on the restart:** 20 minutes
* **Time spent on the remaining download:** 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

"Let's analyze the problem.  John's initial journey covers a distance of 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 mph.  His return trip, covering the remaining distance, is a more complex scenario.

We can break down the second leg of the journey into three distinct segments:

* **Segment 1:**  John's initial 2 hours of travel are characterized by a constant speed of 60 mph.
* **Segment 2:**  The next 30 minutes are at a speed of 30 mph.
* **Segment 3:**  The final 4 hours are at a speed of 80 mph.

To determine the total distance traveled, we need to consider the distance covered in each segment and then sum them up.

**Calculating the distance for each segment:**

* **Segment 1:** Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles
* **Segment 2:** Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles
* **Segment 3:** Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles

**Total Distance:** 120 miles + 15 miles + 320 miles = 455 miles

**Therefore, John is 455 miles from home at the end of the 4-hour journey.**

"To determine the break-even point for Carlos' lemon tree, we need to analyze the relationship between his expenses and earnings.  

Let's define the following variables:

*  *x* = the number of years the lemon tree is planted.
*  *P(x)* = the profit Carlos makes in year *x*.

We can express the profit as a function of time:

*  *P(x) = 7x - 3* 

This equation represents the profit Carlos makes each year. 

To determine when he starts earning money, we need to find the value of *x* when *P(x) > 0*.  

*  *P(x) > 0*  means that the profit is positive. 
*  *P(x) = 7x - 3*  is the equation for the profit.

Solving for *x* when *P(x) > 0* we get:

*  *7x - 3 > 0*
*  *7x > 3*
*  *x > 3/7*

Therefore, Carlos will start earning money on his lemon tree after **year 1**. 


**Final answer: 1**

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach.  

We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining.  This represents the final amount after selling a portion of her inventory.  

We need to determine the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.  

Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.  

* **Green House:**  She sold 1/3 of her total inventory at the green house, leaving (2/3)x.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than the green house, meaning she sold (1/3 + 2) = 5/3 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining inventory at the orange house, meaning she sold (2/3x - 5/3) / 2.

We know the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 5.  

**Therefore, we can set up an equation:**

(1/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/2)(2/3x - 5/3) = 5

**Solving for x:**

1. Simplify the equation: (4/3)x + (1/2)(2/3x - 5/3) = 5
2. Multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the fraction: 8x + (1/3)x - 5/3 = 30
3. Combine like terms: (25/3)x - 5/3 = 30
4. Add 5/3 to both sides: (25/3)x = 95/3
5. Multiply both sides by 3/25: x = 95/25 
6. Simplify: x = 3.8

**Answer:** Melanie started with 3.8 vacuum cleaners.

"To determine the original price, we need to work backward from the sale price after the discount.  

The discount is calculated as 25% of the original price, which we can represent as 0.25 * Original Price.  

Subtracting the discount from the sale price gives us the original price:

Sale Price - (0.25 * Original Price) = Original Price

We know the sale price is $19.50.  Let's substitute that in:

$19.50 - (0.25 * Original Price) = Original Price

Solving for the Original Price:

$19.50 - 0.25 * Original Price = Original Price

$19.50 = 1.25 * Original Price

Original Price = $19.50 / 1.25

Original Price = $15.60


**Therefore, the original price of the book was $15.60.**

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we can leverage the concept of ratios and their relationship to age.  

Let's represent Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x.  The ratio of their ages is 7:11, which translates to the following equation:

7x / 11x = 7/11

We know their total age is 162, so we can set up the following equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Simplifying the equation:

18x = 162

Solving for x:

x = 162 / 18 = 9

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age in 10 years = 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is given as 110.

Therefore, we can write the following equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios.  

We know Sarah's laundry load is represented as a ratio of 4:1 to David's load.  This means for every 1 pound David does, Sarah does 4 pounds.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds, we can find David's load by setting up a proportion:

*  Let David's load be represented by 'x'.
*  Sarah's load is 4 times David's load, so we can write the proportion: 4/1 = 400/x

Solving for x, we get:

*  4x = 400
*  x = 100

Now, we can find Raymond's load:

*  Raymond does half of Sarah's load, so he does 1/2 * 400 = 200 pounds.

Finally, the difference in their loads is:

*  200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

"To determine the cost savings, we need to compare the unit price per flower for both package options. 

* **Option 1:**  Flowers purchased in packages of 3 for $2.50, resulting in a unit price of $0.83 per flower.
* **Option 2:** Flowers purchased in packages of 2 for $1.00, resulting in a unit price of $0.50 per flower.

To find the savings, we can calculate the cost of purchasing 18 flowers using each option.

**Option 1:** 18 flowers * $0.83/flower = $14.94
**Option 2:** 18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00

The difference in cost is $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94.

**Therefore, Vincent saves $5.94 by purchasing 18 flowers at the 2-flower package price.**

"To determine the number of wins, we can set up a system of equations. Let 'x' represent the number of games lost and 'y' represent the number of games won.  We know the following:

*  x + y = 22 (The total number of games played is 22)
*  y = x + 8 (They won 8 more than they lost)

Now, we can solve for 'x' in the second equation:
y = x + 8

Substitute this value of 'y' into the first equation:
x + (x + 8) = 22

Simplify and solve for 'x':
2x + 8 = 22
2x = 14
x = 7

Now that we know 'x' (the number of games lost is 7), we can find 'y' (the number of games won):
y = x + 8
y = 7 + 8
y = 15

Therefore, the team won **15** games.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'C' represent the number of pets Cindy has.
* Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has C + 2 pets.
* Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3(C + 2) pets.

Now, we know that Cindy has 4 pets, so C = 4.

Substituting this value into the equation for Marcia's pets: Marcia has C + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Finally, substituting the values for C and Marcia into the equation for Jan's pets: Jan has 3(C + 2) = 3(4 + 2) = 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

To find the total number of pets, add the number of pets each person has: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'd' represent the number of dogs.
* Let 'c' represent the number of cats.
* Let 'r' represent the number of rabbits.

"The hospital's profit is calculated by considering both the revenue generated from patient charges and the revenue generated from doctor's fees. 

**Revenue from Patient Charges:**

* The hospital sees 500 patients per day, each requiring an average of 24 minutes of care. 
* To determine the total time spent by patients, we convert the average time per patient to hours: 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours per patient.
* The total time spent by patients is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.
* The hospital charges patients $200 per hour for their services. 
* The total revenue from patient charges is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

**Revenue from Doctor's Fees:**

* The hospital's doctors charge $150 per hour for their services.
* The total revenue from doctor's fees is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

**Profit Calculation:**

* The hospital's profit is the difference between the total revenue from patient charges and the total revenue from doctor's fees.
* Profit = Total Revenue from Patient Charges - Total Revenue from Doctor's Fees
* Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.


**Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.**

"The price of the bag of marbles increases by a compound interest rate of 20% every two months.  To calculate the final price after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

**A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)**

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:

* P = $20 (initial price)
* r = 0.20 (20% expressed as a decimal)
* n = 2 (compounded every two months)
* t = 36 months / 12 months/year = 3 years

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = 20(1 + 0.20/2)^(2*3)
A = 20(1 + 0.10)^6
A = 20(1.10)^6
A = 20 * 1.799
A = $35.98

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is **$35.98**.

* **Total Expenses:** $1500 + $2000 = $3500

After these expenses, Zaid has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 remaining.

He then donates half of this remaining amount to charity, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

Subtracting the donation, Zaid has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

Finally, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, leaving him with $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'B' represent the number of crabs Bo has.
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has B - 4 crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has B - 4 + 10 = B + 6 crabs.

Now we can express the total number of crabs as:

Total crabs = B + (B - 4) + (B + 6)

Simplifying the equation:

Total crabs = 3B + 2

We know that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.  Substituting this into our equation:

Total crabs = 3(40) + 2 = 120 + 2 = 122

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of white carnations.
* Sandra ordered 4x red roses.
* Fred ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are 5 times the number of white carnations, so we can represent this as 5x.

We know that Sandra's order is a combination of red roses and white carnations.  We can express this as:

*  x + 4x = total number of roses

We also know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are 5 times the number of white carnations.  We can express this as:

* 5x = total number of calla lilies

Now we can solve for the number of white carnations (x).

* 5x = 200
* x = 40

We can now substitute the value of x back into the first equation to find the number of red roses:

* 40 + 4(40) = total number of roses
* 40 + 160 = total number of roses
* 200 = total number of roses

Therefore, Fred must deliver **200** red roses by 5 pm.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'J' represent Jean's current age.
* Let 'M' represent Mark's current age.

We are given the following information:

*  J = M + 2  (Jean is two years older than Mark)
*  M - 2 = (1/2) * J - 5  (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age)

Now we can solve for J.

**Solving for J:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since J = M + 2, we can substitute this into the second equation:
   M - 2 = (1/2)(M + 2) - 5

2. **Simplify and solve for M:**
   * M - 2 = (1/2)M + 1 - 5
   * M - 2 = (1/2)M - 4
   * M + 2 = (1/2)M
   * 2M + 4 = M
   * M = -4 

   This result is not possible as age cannot be negative. This indicates there is an error in the problem statement. 


**Conclusion:**

The provided information leads to a contradiction, making it impossible to determine Jean's age.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  The key to this problem is recognizing that the second runner's time is 3 seconds faster than the first, the third runner's time is 3 seconds faster than the second, and so on. This creates a consistent pattern of increasing time differences.

* **Calculating the Total Time:**  To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we need to add the times of each runner. 

* **Calculating the Winning Margin:**  The faster team's total time is calculated by multiplying the time of each runner by the number of runners.  The difference in time between the two teams is the winning margin.

"To determine the relative likelihood of an event, we need to calculate the probability of the event and then compare it to the probability of another event.  

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is 3/6 = 1/2, or 50%.  

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 3/6 * 2/6 = 1/6.

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/6.  The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/6.

"Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a simple interest rate of 2% per month.  To calculate the total amount due after 3 months, we need to consider the interest accrued over the three-month period.

The formula for simple interest is:

**Interest = Principal * Rate * Time**

Where:
* Principal = $100 (the original amount owed)
* Rate = 2% (annual interest rate, converted to a monthly rate by dividing by 12)
* Time = 3 months

Plugging in the values:

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * (3/12) = $0.50

Therefore, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months is:

$100 + $0.50 = $100.50

"The trader's profit is the result of selling the wheat at a higher price than the cost of acquiring and transporting it.  We can express this as a linear equation:

* **Profit = Revenue - Cost**

Let 'x' represent the number of bags sold.  

* **Revenue:** 30x (selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold)
* **Cost:** 20x (cost per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold) plus 2x (transportation cost per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

* 400 = 30x - (20x + 2x)

Simplifying the equation:

* 400 = 30x - 22x
* 400 = 8x

Solving for x:

* x = 400 / 8
* x = 50

**Answer:** The trader sold **50** bags.

"To determine Brinley's required score on the sixth test, we need to understand the concept of weighted averages.  

Since Mr. Bert is using a weighted average, the lowest score is removed from the calculation. This means we need to find the score that, when added to the existing scores, will result in a total of 558 points.

Let's denote the unknown score on the sixth test as 'x'.  

The weighted average is calculated as follows:

(Sum of all scores) / (Number of tests)

We can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 6 = 93

Simplifying the equation:

(448 + x) / 6 = 93

Multiplying both sides by 6:

448 + x = 558

Subtracting 448 from both sides:

x = 110

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of **110** on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"Janeth's loan is structured as a simple loan with a fixed interest rate.  The total amount she will pay back is the principal plus the interest.  

To calculate the remaining balance, we need to determine the total interest she will accrue over the 12 months. 

* **Principal:** $2000
* **Interest Rate:**  We need to know the interest rate to calculate the interest. 
* **Payment:** $165 per month

**To determine the remaining balance, we can use the amortization formula:**

* **A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt) - PV**

Where:

* A = the future value of the loan
* P = the principal amount borrowed
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the loan is outstanding
* PV = the present value of the loan

**However, we are given a monthly payment, not a yearly interest rate.  We can use the following formula to calculate the remaining balance:**

* **Remaining Balance = Principal + (Monthly Payment * Number of Payments) - (Interest)**

**To calculate the interest, we need to know the interest rate.**

"The problem presents a simple addition scenario.  We know there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses.  Therefore, the total number of flowers is 4 + 11 = 15. 

**Answer:** 15

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Adrian's current age be represented by 'a'
* Let Harriet's current age be represented by 'h'
* Let Zack's current age be represented by 'z'

We are given the following information:

1.  a = 3h  (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age)
2.  h = z/2  (Harriet's age is half of Zack's age)

We are asked to find the average age of the three in three years.  This means we need to calculate the average of (a + h + z + 3) in three years.

To find the average, we can substitute the values of 'a', 'h', and 'z' from the given equations into the expression for the average age in three years.

*  (a + h + z + 3) = (3h + h + z + 3) = (4h + z + 3)

Now, we need to find the values of 'h', 'z', and 'a' in terms of 'z' to simplify the expression.

*  Since h = z/2, we can substitute this into the expression: (4 * (z/2) + z + 3) = 2z + z + 3 = 3z + 3

We can now substitute the value of 'h' in terms of 'z' into the expression for the average age in three years:

*  (3z + 3)

To find the average age in three years, we need to find the value of 'z' and then substitute it into the expression. 

*  We know that Harriet is 21 years old now, so we can substitute this into the equation h = z/2 to find the value of 'z'. 
*  We can then substitute the value of 'z' into the expression for the average age in three years.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

* **Naomi's score:**  Naomi contributed 68 points.
* **Yuri's score:** Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, meaning he scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* **Brianna's score:** Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

* **Step 3: Cards with B:**  Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B. (1/2) * 48 cards = 24 cards.
* **Step 4: Cards remaining after B:**  We calculate the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter B. 48 cards - 24 cards = 24 cards.
* **Step 5: Cards with C:**  We find the number of cards with the letter C. (5/8) * 24 cards = 15 cards.
* **Step 6: Cards with D:**  Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D. 24 cards - 15 cards = 9 cards.

"To determine the total time required, we need to consider the time spent on each type of hole and the respective quantities. 

* **Small holes:**  Each small hole takes 3 minutes to dig.  We need to calculate the total time for 30 small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
* **Large holes:** Each large hole takes 10 minutes to dig. We need to calculate the total time for 15 large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we sum the time for both types of holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40. 

**Answer:** 40 
"
"The given system of equations can be solved using substitution.  

Let's represent Ruby's current age as 'R' and Sam's current age as 'S'.  We are given:

* R = 6S  (Equation 1)
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9)  (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we can substitute '6S' for 'R' in Equation 2:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the right side:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Combining like terms:

3S = 18

Solving for S:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to find the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas. 

* **Cobras:**  There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
* **Mambas:** There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.
* **Combined Spots:** The total number of spots on all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, to find half the combined number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"To determine the number of silver beads, we can set up a linear equation. Let 'x' represent the number of silver beads.  

The total length of the necklace is the sum of the topaz length and the silver bead length.  We can express this as:

8 * topaz length + x * bead length = total length

Substituting the given values:

8 * 1 inch + x * (0.25 inches/bead) = 25 inches

Simplifying the equation:

8 + 0.25x = 25

Solving for x:

0.25x = 17
x = 17 / 0.25
x = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses **68** silver beads per necklace.

"To determine the number of trucks required, we need to determine the number of times the total weight of the flagstones can be divided by the weight capacity of a single truck. 

The total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  Each truck can carry 2,000 pounds.  

Therefore, we can divide the total weight by the weight capacity of a single truck:

5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks

Since we cannot have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** 3 trucks

"The problem presents a classic application of the relationship between distance, speed, and time.  

We are given that a car traveling at 60 miles per hour covers a distance of 480 miles.  To determine the time taken by a car traveling at half that speed, we can use the following formula:

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

Let 't' represent the time taken by the slower car.  We can express the relationship as:

* 480 miles = (30 miles/hour) * t

Solving for 't', we get:

* t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car traveling at half the speed took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"To achieve Peter's goal of exercising twice the time from Sunday and Monday, we need to determine the required duration for Tuesday.  

We know that on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday for 16 minutes.  

To find the total time spent on Sunday and Monday, we add these values: 23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

To double this time, we multiply the total time by 2: 39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday.

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of books Elise sold in the first year.** 
* **The first year's sales:** Elise sold 2x books in the first year.
* **The second year's sales:** Elise sold 2x * 2 = 4x books in the second year.
* **Total books sold in the first two years:** 2x + 4x = 6x
* **Total books sold in the third year:** Elise sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the third year.
* **Total earnings in the first two years:** 2x * $20 = 40x
* **Total earnings in the third year:** 200 * $20 = 4000

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week.  To find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of weeks Sandy needs.
*  We know Joey loses 2 pounds per week, so we can write the proportion: 2 pounds/week = x weeks

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

* 2 pounds * x weeks = 8 pounds

Simplifying the equation:

* 2x = 8

Dividing both sides by 2:

* x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy **4** weeks to lose the same amount of weight.

*  Let 'J' represent Jane's age.
*  Let 'T' represent Trent's age.

We are given the following information:

*  Q = 30 (Quinn is 30 years old)
*  J = Q - 3 (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)
*  T = J + 5 (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)

Substituting the value of Q into the equation for J:

*  J = 30 - 3 = 27

Now, substitute the value of J into the equation for T:

*  T = 27 + 5 = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let 'x' represent Noah's current age.**
* **Cera's current age is 46.**

We know that six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age. This translates to:

* **Noah's age six years ago: x - 6**
* **Cera's age six years ago: 46 - 6 = 40**

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago. This translates to:

* **Population of Chile six years ago: 3000 * (x - 6)**

We can now set up an equation to represent the population of Chile six years ago:

* **3000 * (x - 6) = 60,000**

To find the current population of Chile, we need to solve for 'x'.  

**Solving for x:**

1. **Divide both sides by 3000:** (x - 6) = 60,000 / 3000
2. **Simplify:** (x - 6) = 20
3. **Add 6 to both sides:** x = 26

**Therefore, Noah's current age is 26.**

**To find the current population of Chile, we can use the equation:**

* **Population of Chile now = Cera's current age + 6**
* **Population of Chile now = 46 + 6 = 52**

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let:

*  *x* represent the number of players on the defense.

We know the following:

* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2*x players on offense.
* **Special Teams:** There are half the number of players on special teams as the defense, so there are *x/2* players on special teams.

The total number of players is 105:  *x* + 2*x* + *x*/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get: (7/2)*x* = 105

Solving for *x*, we find: *x* = 105 * (2/7) = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios.  

* **Ratio of Girls to Boys:** The ratio of girls to boys is 3:1. This means for every 3 girls, there is 1 boy.
* **Ratio of Non-Gendered to Boys:** The ratio of non-gendered children to boys is 1/10. This means for every 10 boys, there is 1 non-gendered child.

To find the total number of children, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the number of girls:**  Since the ratio of girls to boys is 3:1, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.  
   * Number of girls = 30 boys * 3 = 90 girls

2. **Calculate the number of non-gendered children:**  The ratio of non-gendered children to boys is 1/10.  We can find the number of non-gendered children by multiplying the number of boys by 1/10.
   * Number of non-gendered children = 30 boys * (1/10) = 3 non-gendered children

3. **Calculate the total number of children:**  Add the number of girls, boys, and non-gendered children.
   * Total children = 90 girls + 30 boys + 3 non-gendered children = 123 children

"The problem states that 1/4 of the total number of people left the party.  This means that 1/4 of the initial 40 people departed.  

To find the number of women remaining, we need to consider the initial number of women and the number who left.  

* **Initial number of women:** 15
* **Number of women who left:** 1/4 * 15 = 3.75 (We'll round this down to 3 since we can't have a fraction of a person)
* **Number of women remaining:** 15 - 3 = 12

Therefore, 12 women are left at the party.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where we need to work with a system of equations to solve for an unknown variable.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of old records each person brought in.**
* **The problem states that 5 people traded records, and they left with 7 new records.** This means the total number of old records traded is 5x. 
* **The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.** This is a key piece of information that allows us to set up an equation.

**The equation:** 5x = 7

**Solving for x:**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 7/5 = 1.4

**The problem statement has an error.**  The number of old records cannot be a fraction.  

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"The company's programming staff comprises a ratio of junior to senior programmers that can be represented as a fraction.  We know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.  This means that the number of senior programmers is represented by 3/5 of the total number of employees.

To calculate the total salary of all programmers, we need to consider the salary of each programmer type and the total number of each type.

* **Junior Programmers:**  The salary of a junior programmer is $2000 per month.
* **Senior Programmers:** The salary of a senior programmer is $400 more than a junior programmer, so it is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

The total salary of all programmers can be calculated as follows:

* **Total Salary of Junior Programmers:** 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* **Total Salary of Senior Programmers:** 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

**Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.**

"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we need to understand the charging rate. The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.  

To calculate the time for a 40% charge (as the phone needs to go from 60% to 100%), we can use the following:

* **Charge gain:** 40%
* **Charge rate:** 1% per 3 minutes
* **Time (in minutes):**  (Charge gain) / (Charge rate) = 40 / 1 = 40 minutes

"The problem presents a classic system of equations to solve for the number of chickens and cows on the farm.  

Let's represent the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'.  We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
* **Equation 2:** c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

To solve this system, we can use substitution.  From Equation 2, we can express 'c' in terms of 'w': 
c = 2w

Now, substitute this expression for 'c' into Equation 1:
2w + w = 60

Combine like terms: 3w = 60

Solve for 'w':
w = 60 / 3
w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find 'c':
c = 2 * 20
c = 40

Finally, to find the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs for each animal type:

* Chickens have 2 legs each.
* Cows have 4 legs each.

Total legs = (Number of chickens * Legs per chicken) + (Number of cows * Legs per cow)
Total legs = (40 * 2) + (20 * 4)
Total legs = 80 + 80
Total legs = 160

Therefore, the total number of legs on the farm is 160.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of people kicked out for mask refusal.
*  *y* represent the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
*  *z* represent the number of people kicked out for physical violence.

We are given the following system of equations:

1.  *x = 4y - 5* 
2.  *y = 3z*
3.  *x + y + z = 50*

We can solve for *x* in equation 1:
* *x = 4y - 5*

Substitute equation 2 into this equation:
* *x = 4(3z) - 5*
* *x = 12z - 5*

Now, substitute this value of *x* into equation 3:
* *(12z - 5) + y + z = 50*

Substitute equation 2 into this equation:
* *(12z - 5) + 3z + z = 50*
* *16z - 5 = 50*

Solve for *z*:
* *16z = 55*
* *z = 55/16*

Substitute the value of *z* back into equation 2 to find *y*:
* *y = 3 * (55/16)*
* *y = 165/16*

Finally, substitute the values of *z* and *y* into equation 1 to find *x*:
* *x = 4 * (165/16) - 5*
* *x = 65 - 5*
* *x = 60*

"Karan needs to make monthly payments to repay her loan.  The formula for calculating the monthly payment on a simple interest loan is:

**M = P * (r * (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)**

Where:

* M = Monthly payment
* P = Principal amount borrowed ($3650)
* r = Annual interest rate (0.10 or 10%)
* n = Number of months (5)

Let's plug in the values:

M = 3650 * (0.10 * (1 + 0.10)^5) / ((1 + 0.10)^5 - 1)

M = 3650 * (0.10 * 1.61051) / (1.61051 - 1)

M = 3650 * 0.161051 / 0.61051

M ≈ $3680.42

Therefore, Karan needs to pay approximately **$3680.42** per month to repay her loan.

"Mel's energy consumption can be analyzed by converting the daily usage from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours.  

First, we need to determine the daily energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).  

* 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1000 watts (W)
* Therefore, 1 watt-hour (Wh) = 1/1000 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

Mel's AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours daily.  This means his daily energy consumption is:

* 900 W/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 Wh/day

To convert this to kWh, we divide by 1000:

* 7200 Wh/day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh/day

Now, let's consider the scenario where Mel reduces his AC usage by 5 hours.  His new daily energy consumption is:

* 900 W/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 Wh/day

To calculate the energy saved, we subtract his new daily consumption from his original daily consumption:

* 7.2 kWh/day - 2.7 kWh/day = 4.5 kWh/day

Finally, to determine the total energy saved over 30 days, we multiply his daily energy savings by the number of days:

* 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

Therefore, Mel will save **135 kWh** of energy in 30 days.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'c' represent the number of cannolis.
* Let 'x' represent the number of corn.

We know the following:

*  *c = 40* (Allan has 40 cannolis initially)
*  *x = 2c* (He has twice as much corn as cannolis)
*  *x = 60 + c* (He bought 60 more cannolis)

Now, we can solve for 'c' and 'x'.

* Substitute the value of 'c' from the first equation into the second equation: *x = 2(40) = 80*
* Substitute the value of 'c' and 'x' into the third equation: *80 = 60 + c*
* Solve for 'c': *c = 80 - 60 = 20*

Now that we know the number of cannolis and corn, we can find the combined total:

* Total = c + x = 20 + 80 = 100

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corn and cannolis Allan has in the house is 100.

"The problem presents a scenario where we need to determine the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Event A:** A candle is defective.
* **Event B:** A candle explodes.

We are given that 5% of the candles are defective, and 99% of the candles are not defective.  We are also given that 5% of the defective candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

To find the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding, we need to consider the following:

* **Probability of Event A:** 0.05 (5%)
* **Probability of Event B:** 0.99 (99%)
* **Probability of Event A and B:**  We need to consider the probability of a candle being defective AND exploding. This is the intersection of the two events.

**The key here is that the events are independent.** This means that the probability of a candle being defective does not affect the probability of it exploding.

Therefore, the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding is simply the product of the probability of a candle being defective and the probability of it exploding.

**Answer:** 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
*  'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
*  't' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  a + b + t = 500 (The total number of apples gathered by both sisters)
*  b = 2t (Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne)
*  b = 3a (Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne)

Now, we can solve for 'a' (the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees).

**Substituting the values of 'b' from the second and third equations into the first equation:**

a + 2t + t = 500
a + 3t = 500

**We can solve for 't' in terms of 'a' using the second equation:**

t = (b/2) = (3a/2)

**Substitute this value of 't' into the first equation:**

a + 3(3a/2) = 500
a + (9a/2) = 500

**Combine like terms:**

(2a/2) + (9a/2) = 500
(11a/2) = 500

**Solve for 'a':**

a = 500 * (2/11)
a = 909.09 (approximately)

**Therefore, Joanne gathered approximately 909 apples from the average trees.**

"The problem presents a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:

*  *c* represents the number of camels.
*  *d* represents the number of dromedaries.

We are given the following information:

*  *c + d = 180* (The total number of heads is 180)
*  *2c + d = 304* (The total number of bumps is 304)

To solve for the number of dromedaries (*d*), we can utilize a method called substitution.  

**Solving for *c*:**

From the first equation, we can isolate *c*:
* c = 180 - d

**Substituting into the second equation:**

Substitute this value of *c* into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

**Simplifying and solving for *d*:**

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

**Answer:** There are **56** dromedaries.

"Tom's trip can be broken down into two distinct phases: the initial leg and the second week. 

* **Phase 1:**  Tom traveled 800 kilometers in the first four days, representing 4 days of travel. 
* **Phase 2:**  He then traveled 240 kilometers in the next two days, representing 2 days of travel. 
* **Phase 3:**  Tom took a rest day on day 7.
* **Phase 4:**  He traveled 300 kilometers per day for the remaining 7 days of the trip.

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to consider the distance covered in each phase.

* **Phase 1:** 800 km
* **Phase 2:** 240 km
* **Phase 3:** 0 km
* **Phase 4:** 2100 km

**Total Distance:** 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = **3140 km**

"Let's break down the problem using the concept of proportions.  

We know Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker measures 5 cubic inches.  To find the size of Zack's locker, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the size of Zack's locker.
*  We know Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, so we can write the proportion: 1/4 = 5/x

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

*  1 * x = 5 * 4
*  x = 20

Therefore, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.  Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

**Answer:** Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"The cost of the streaming service can be calculated by breaking it down into distinct phases:

* **Introductory Phase:** The initial 6 months are at a discounted rate of $8 per month.
* **Transitional Phase:** The price increases to $12 per month for the next 2 months.
* **Standard Phase:** The price then increases to $14 per month for the remaining 6 months.

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the duration of each phase and the corresponding price.

**Phase 1:** 6 months at $8/month = $8 * 6 = $48
**Phase 2:** 2 months at $12/month = $12 * 2 = $24
**Phase 3:** 6 months at $14/month = $14 * 6 = $84

**Total Cost:** $48 + $24 + $84 = $156

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years (24 months) is $156 * 2 = **$312**.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the original price of the tattered jeans.
* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so their original price is 'x - $6'.

We know the following:

* The total cost of the jeans is $50.  This can be represented as: x + (x - $6) = $50
* Cole saved a total of $6. This can be represented as:  x - (1/3)(x - $6) = $6

Now, let's solve for 'x' (the original price of the tattered jeans):

1. Combine like terms in the first equation: 2x - $6 = $50
2. Add $6 to both sides: 2x = $56
3. Divide both sides by 2: x = $28

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans:

* The jogger jeans cost 'x - $6', so their original price is $28 - $6 = $22

Finally, calculate the difference in price:

* The original price of the jogger jeans was $22, and the price of the tattered jeans was $28.
* The difference is $28 - $22 = $6.

"Let's break down this problem using a fractional representation of Kenny's card collection.  

* **Let 'x' represent the total number of cards Kenny started with.**

* **Earnings from selling cards:**  Kenny will earn 1.5x dollars from selling his cards.

* **Spending money:**  He has $50 in cash, which is a fixed amount.

* **Setting up the equation:** We know that the earnings from selling cards must equal the cost of the amusement park ticket.  Therefore: 1.5x = $100

* **Solving for x:** To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it.  Divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:
   x = $100 / 1.5 
   x = 66.67

* **Rounding to the nearest whole number:**  Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round 66.67 to the nearest whole number, which is 67.

**Answer:** Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where we need to determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hot dog.  

Let's break it down:

* **Initial Setup:** The caterer was instructed to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, assuming a standard consumption pattern.
* **Scaling:** The caterer anticipated that half of the guests would want two hot dogs, which is a common practice in catering scenarios.
* **Actual Demand:**  40 guests arrived, exceeding the initial expectation. 
* **The Key Insight:**  The caterer prepared enough hot dogs to satisfy the demand for two hot dogs, but the actual number of guests who wanted two hot dogs is 18. 

Therefore, the number of guests who did not receive a second hot dog is 40 - 18 = **22**.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of candy bars purchased.
* Let 'y' represent the number of chips purchased.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. **Equation 1 (Total Cost):** 0.40x + 0.75y = 5  (The total cost of the chips and candy bars is $5)
2. **Equation 2 (Leftover Money):** 0.01(5) = 0.05 (George had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05)

We can solve for 'y' in Equation 2:

* 0.01(5) = 0.05
* 0.05 = 0.05

This equation is a bit unusual, but it tells us that George had $0.05 left after spending $5.  

We can use this information to solve for 'x' in Equation 1. 

* 0.40x + 0.75y = 5
* 0.75y = 5 - 0.40x
* y = (5 - 0.40x) / 0.75

We can substitute this value of 'y' back into Equation 1 to solve for 'x'. 

* 0.40x + 0.75 * ((5 - 0.40x) / 0.75) = 5
* 0.40x + (5 - 0.40x) = 5
* 0.40x + 5 - 0.40x = 5
* 5 = 5

This equation is a tautology, meaning it is always true.  

**Therefore, we can conclude that George bought 6 candy bars.**

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost-equivalent, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other.  

Let's represent the number of guests as 'x'.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 + $5x 
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25x

Setting the two cost equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now, solve for 'x':

1. Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
2. Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are necessary for the two venues to be cost-equivalent.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Formulate the System:**
    * The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the System:**
    * Simplify the equation: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Combine like terms: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Determine Lily's Insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios.  

We know that Rose's purchase can be represented as a ratio of 4:1 (4 onions to 1 potato).  This means for every 4 onions Rose buys, she buys 1 potato.

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
*  We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can write the proportion: 4/1 = 12/x

Solving for x:

* Cross-multiply: 4 * x = 12 * 1
* Simplify: 4x = 12
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, let's find the number of potatoes Sophia bought:

* We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.
* We can use the ratio to find the number of potatoes Sophia bought: 4/1 = 3/1
*  Therefore, Sophia bought 3 potatoes.

"John's research funding exhibits a compound growth pattern.  Let's analyze the funding increase:

* **Initial funding:** $100,000
* **Monthly increase:**  The funding increases by 50% each month, which is a geometric growth pattern. 
* **Total funding:**  To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the initial funding and the cumulative effect of the monthly increases.

**Calculation:**

The monthly increase is a geometric progression, and we can use the formula for compound growth to calculate the total cost. 

* **Formula:**  A = P(1 + r)^n
    * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
    * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
    * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
    * n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year

**Applying the formula:**

* P = $100,000
* r = 0.50 (50% increase)
* n = 25 months

**Calculating the total cost:**

* A = $100,000 (1 + 0.50)^25 
* A = $100,000 (1.50)^25
* A ≈ $1,350,000

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.

* Let 'x' represent the price of a diamond Jewell.
* The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of a diamond, so the price of a gold Jewell is (4/5)x.
* The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so the price of a silver Jewell is (1 - 4/5) * (4/5)x = (1/5) * (4/5)x = (4/25)x.

Now we can express the total cost as a function of x:

Total cost = x + (4/5)x + (4/25)x = (1 + 4/5 + 4/25)x = (1 + 4/5 + 4/25)x = (33/25)x

We know the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000, so we can substitute this into our equation:

2000 = (33/25)x

Solving for x:

x = 2000 * (25/33) = $147.27 (approximately)

Now we can find the price of the gold and silver jewels:

* Gold Jewell: (4/5) * $147.27 = $118.58
* Silver Jewell: (4/25) * $147.27 = $21.86

Finally, calculate the total cost:

Total cost = $147.27 + $118.58 + $21.86 = $287.71

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the distance Lynn ran.
* Paisley ran 4 miles.
* Reggie ran 5 times Paisley's distance plus 3 miles more than Lynn's distance.

This translates to the following equation:

* Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance + 3 
* Reggie's distance = 5 * 4 + 3 = 23 miles

Now, we can use the information about the total distance to find Lynn's distance.

* Total distance = Paisley's distance + Reggie's distance + Lynn's distance
* 4 + 23 + x = Total distance

We know that the total distance is the sum of the distances of all three runners.  

* 4 + 23 + x = 4 + 23 + x 

We can solve for x:

* 27 = 4 + 23 + x
* 27 - 27 = 4 + 23 + x - 27
* 0 = 23 + x - 23
* 0 = x

Therefore, Lynn ran 0 miles.

"Let's represent the cost of one apple as 'a' and the cost of one orange as 'o'. We can set up a system of two equations based on the given information:

* Equation 1: 4a + 3o = 5.20 
* Equation 2: 5a + 5o = 12.00

We can solve this system of equations using elimination.  

**Step 1: Simplify Equation 1 by dividing both sides by 4:**

* a + (3/4)o = 1.30

**Step 2: Multiply Equation 1 by -3 and Equation 2 by 4:**

* -3a - (9/4)o = -3.90
* 20a + 20o = 48.00

**Step 3: Add the two equations together:**

* 17a = 44.10

**Step 4: Solve for 'a':**

* a = 44.10 / 17 = 2.60

**Step 5: Substitute the value of 'a' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'o'. Let's use Equation 1:**

* 2.60 + (3/4)o = 1.30
* (3/4)o = -1.30 - 2.60
* (3/4)o = -3.90
* o = -3.90 * (4/3) = -5.27

**Therefore, the cost of one apple is $2.60 and the cost of one orange is -$5.27.  This result is not possible in the real world, as the price of an orange cannot be negative.**

"The total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price and the annual cost of hangar rental and fuel. 

* **Initial Purchase:** The plane cost $150,000.
* **Annual Hangar Rental:**  The monthly cost is $5,000, so the annual cost is $5,000 * 12 = $60,000.
* **Annual Fuel Cost:** The monthly fuel cost is $10,000, so the annual cost is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Therefore, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the cooking time for rice.**
* **Pork takes 20 minutes longer than rice, so it takes 'x + 20' minutes.**
* **Beans take half the combined time of rice and pork, meaning they take (x + 20)/2 minutes.**

**Total cooking time is the sum of individual times:**

*  Total time = x + (x + 20) + (x + 20)/2 

**We know the total time is 30 minutes:**

* 30 = x + (x + 20) + (x + 20)/2

**Simplify and solve for x:**

* 30 = 3x + 40 + (x + 20)/2
* 30 = 3x + 40 + (x/2 + 10)
* 30 = 3x + 40 + x/2 + 10
* 30 = (7x/2) + 50
* 30 - 50 = (7x/2)
* -20 = (7x/2)
* -40 = 7x
* x = -40/7

**Since time cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement.**

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations.  Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.

The total number of legs is 70, and the total number of heads is 20.  This translates to the following system of equations:

*  4s + 2g = 70 (Equation 1)
*  s + g = 20 (Equation 2)

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get:
*  s = 20 - g

Substituting this value of 's' into Equation 1:
*  4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'g':
*  80 - 4g + 2g = 70
*  -2g = -10
*  g = 5

Now, substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g:
*  s = 20 - 5
*  s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let  'A' represent Aurelia's money.
* Let 'K' represent Kassidy's money.
* Let 'R' represent Rayna's money.

We are given the following information:

*  R = K + 60  (Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy)
*  K = (3/4)A  (Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia)

Now, we can substitute the value of K from the second equation into the first equation:

* R = (3/4)A + 60

We know that A = $120 (Aurelia has $120).  Substituting this into the equation:

* R = (3/4) * $120 + 60
* R = $90 + 60
* R = $150

Now, we can find the total amount of money:

* Total Money = A + K + R
* Total Money = $120 + $90 + $150
* Total Money = $360

Finally, we can find the amount each person receives:

* Amount per person = Total Money / 3
* Amount per person = $360 / 3
* Amount per person = $120

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'M' represent the number of cookies Max has.
* Let 'C' represent the number of cookies Katarina has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* C = M - 5  (Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max)
* M = S + 12  (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
* S = C + 23  (Summer has 23 more cookies than Max)

Now, we can substitute to solve for the number of cookies each person has.

Substituting C from the first equation into the second equation:
* M = (S + 12) 

Substituting M from the second equation into the third equation:
* S = (M - 5) + 23

Simplifying the third equation:
* S = M + 18

Now, we can substitute the value of M from the second equation into the third equation:
* S = (S + 12) + 18

Simplifying the equation:
* S = S + 30

This equation is a bit tricky, but it tells us that the number of cookies 'S' is equal to itself plus 30.

"The problem presents a direct proportionality relationship between the cat's speed and the turtle's speed.  We can express this relationship as a ratio:

*  Cat's speed : Turtle's speed = 5 : 1

To find the turtle's speed, we can use the following proportion:

*  Cat's speed / Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / x feet/second = 5 / 1

Solving for x, we get:

*  x = (5/1) * (Turtle's speed)
*  x = 5 * Turtle's speed

We know the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so we can substitute this into the equation:

*  15 feet/second = 5 * Turtle's speed

Therefore, the turtle's speed is:

*  Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, to find the distance the turtle crawls in 40 seconds, we can use the following:

*  Distance = Speed * Time

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we can set up a system of equations representing the production rates of chocolate and vanilla ice cream. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of hours the factory works on chocolate ice cream.
*  *y* represent the number of hours the factory works on vanilla ice cream.

We know the following:

* **Chocolate ice cream production:** The factory produces 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour.  
* **Vanilla ice cream production:** The factory produces 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.

We can express the total quarts produced as:

* **Chocolate ice cream production:** 50x 
* **Vanilla ice cream production:** 12.5y

The total production in 48 hours is the sum of the production of both types of ice cream:

* **Total production:** 50x + 12.5y = 2900 

We also know that the total time worked is 48 hours, so:

* **Total time:** x + y = 48

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of *x* and *y*. 

**Solving for x and y:**

One way to solve this system is through substitution.  From the second equation, we can express *y* in terms of *x*:

* y = 48 - x

Substitute this expression for *y* into the first equation:

* 50x + 12.5(48 - x) = 2900

Simplify and solve for *x*:

* 50x + 500 - 12.5x = 2900
* 37.5x = 2400
* x = 64

Substitute the value of *x* back into the equation for *y*:

* y = 48 - 64
* y = -16

This result is not possible as time cannot be negative.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Dora's age be represented by the variable 'd'.
* Her father's age is represented by 'f'.
* Her mother's age is represented by 'm'.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  f = 2d + 8  (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
*  m = f - 4   (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)

Now, we know Dora's age is 15.  Substituting this into the first equation:

* f = 2(15) + 8
* f = 30 + 8
* f = 38

Substituting the value of 'f' into the second equation:

* m = 38 - 4
* m = 34

Finally, calculate the total combined age:

* Total age = d + f + m
* Total age = 15 + 38 + 34
* Total age = 87 


Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

"Let's break down this election problem.  

We know that Candidate A received 20% of the votes.  Candidate B received 50% more than Candidate A, which means they received 150% of Candidate A's votes (50% is equivalent to 150% of 20%).  

Therefore, Candidate B received 1.5 times the number of votes that Candidate A received.

The remaining votes were for Candidate C.  The total percentage of votes for A and B is 50%.  

To find the number of votes for Candidate C, we can use the following equation:

* **Total votes = 100%**
* **A and B votes = 50%**
* **C votes = 100% - 50% = 50%**

Therefore, Candidate C received 50% of the votes.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'C' represent the number of marbles Carl has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of marbles Sean has.
* We know that C = 4S (Carl has four times the number of marbles Sean has).
* We also know that S = C/2 (Sean has half the number of marbles Carl has).

Now, we can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation:

C = 4 * (C/2)

Simplifying the equation:

C = 2C

Solving for C:

C - 2C = 0

-C = 0

Therefore, C = 0.

This means that Carl has 0 marbles. 

Sean has 56 marbles. 

To find the combined number of marbles, we can use the following equation:

20 - x = 2x
20 = 3x
x = 20/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to re-evaluate the problem.  The problem states that Bob had 7 fish initially.  This means that the number of white fish he bought must be a whole number.  

Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently stated.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

We can represent the quantities with variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
*  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
*  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
*  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

We are given the following information:

1. **Equal amounts of zest and fragrance:**  x = fragrance
2. **Twice the amount of salt as zest:** y = 2x
3. **Twice the amount of oil as salt:** o = 2y
4. **Equal amounts of salt and sugar:** y = z
5. **Total mixture:** 10 ounces

Now, we can express the total amount of each ingredient in terms of the variables:

*  **Zest:** x ounces
*  **Salt:** y ounces = 2x ounces
*  **Sugar:** z ounces
*  **Oil:** o ounces = 2y ounces = 2(2x) ounces = 4x ounces

We can use the total mixture information to solve for the amount of oil (o). 

**The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.  We can express this as:**

x + y + z + o = 10

**Substituting the expressions for the amounts of each ingredient:**

x + 2x + z + 4x = 10

**Simplifying the equation:**

7x + z = 10

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'J' represent the number of cars Joe has.
* Let 'R' represent the number of cars Robert has.

We are given:

* J = 2R  (Joe has twice as many cars as Robert)
* J - 0.2J = R + 2R  (Joe sells 20% of his cars and gives away twice the number to his mother)

Simplifying the second equation:

* 0.8J = 3R
* J = 3.75R 

Now, substitute the value of J from the first equation into the simplified second equation:

* 2R = 3.75R
* 2R - 3.75R = 0
* -1.75R = 0
* R = 0

This result is not possible.  

Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

"To determine the number of cards Becca possesses, we can utilize a system of equations. Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.  

Smendrick's cards are then represented by 3x, and Becca's cards are represented by 3x + 12.  The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Therefore, PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, which is 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Milly's return presents a straightforward cost analysis.  

First, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book.  The shipping company charges a base rate of $0.35 per pound, and a mileage rate of $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, and the distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.

* **Shipping Cost:** 
    * Weight: 4 pounds
    * Rate per pound: $0.35
    * Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
* **Mileage Cost:**
    * Distance: 20 miles
    * Rate per mile: $0.08
    * Total mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
* **Total Cost:**
    * Shipping cost: $1.40
    * Mileage cost: $1.60
    * Total cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, we need to determine the amount of the refund. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's original price.

* **Refund Amount:**
    * Purchase price: $32
    * Refund percentage: 75%
    * Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Finally, we can calculate Milly's net loss.

"The installation fee is a base price of $129.00, which covers the hanging of the standard items.  Angela's order includes additional items, requiring an additional charge per item.  

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.

The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00. 

**Therefore, the total cost for the installation is $529.00.**

* **Naruto's lifting capacity:** Naruto can lift 10 times the height of Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Finally, to express Naruto's lifting capacity in feet, we convert the given height in inches to feet: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"This problem involves a classic application of the relationship between distance, rate, and time.  

Let's break it down:

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the kangaroos travel a fixed distance at a constant speed.  Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'x'.  
* **Turtles:**  The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 'x/2'.

To find the time it takes the turtles to cover the same distance, we can use the following formula:

* Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles, we can set up the following equation:

* Time (kangaroos) = Distance / x
* Time (turtles) = Distance / (x/2)

We can simplify this to:

* Time (turtles) = Distance / (x/2) = 2 * Distance / x

Now, we can substitute the time taken by the kangaroos (18 hours) into the equation:

* 18 hours = Distance / x

We can now solve for the distance:

* Distance = 18 hours * x

Now, substitute this value of distance into the equation for the turtles:

* Time (turtles) = 2 * (18 hours * x) / x 
* Time (turtles) = 36 hours

**Therefore, it will take the turtles 36 hours to travel the same distance.** 


**Answer:** 36 hours

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of dishes Kora makes.
* Rory makes x + 20 dishes.
* Jada makes 2(x + 20) dishes.

The total number of dishes is the sum of the individual amounts: x + (x + 20) + 2(x + 20) = 140

Simplifying the equation: 
x + x + 20 + 2x + 40 = 140
4x + 60 = 140

Solving for x:
4x = 80
x = 20

Now we can find the number of dishes each person makes:

* Kora: x = 20 dishes
* Rory: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 dishes
* Jada: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 80 dishes

Finally, the total number of dishes is 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

"To determine the number of additional cows needed to increase daily milk production, we can utilize the concept of  ""total milk production"" and ""milk production per cow.""

The farmer currently produces 15 liters of milk per day, and he wants to increase this to 25 liters.  To achieve this, he needs to produce an additional 10 liters of milk.

The key is to understand that the total milk production is directly proportional to the number of cows.  Therefore, to increase the total milk production by 10 liters, he needs to add cows that can produce 10 liters of milk each. 

To find the number of additional cows, we can use the following formula:

* **Additional cows = (Total milk needed - Current milk production) / Milk production per cow**

Plugging in the values:

* **Additional cows = (10 liters - 15 liters) / 5 liters/cow**
* **Additional cows = -5 liters / 5 liters/cow**
* **Additional cows = -1**

This result indicates that the farmer needs to add 1 additional cow to achieve the desired milk production.

"To determine the total length of glue sticks not used, we first need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used.  

We can do this by finding a common denominator for the fractions:

* The least common denominator for 6, 3, and 2 is 6. 
* Convert the fractions to have a denominator of 6:
    * 1/6 = 1/6 * (1/1) = 1/6
    * 2/3 = 2/3 * (2/2) = 4/6
    * 1/2 = 1/2 * (3/3) = 3/6

Now, add the fractions: 
* 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6

Since we are looking for the length of glue sticks not used, we need to subtract the total length of the used glue sticks from the total length of the original glue sticks. 

* 12 mm - (8/6) mm = 12 mm - (4/3) mm

To simplify the answer, we can convert the fraction to a decimal:
* 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 12 mm - 1.33 mm = 10.67 mm

**Answer:** 10.67 mm

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'S' represent the number of socks Peter has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of socks Jack has.
* Let 'D' represent the number of dishes Jack has.

We are given the following information:

* J = 2D  (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
* S = 2J (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)
* D = 60 (Jack collected 60 dishes)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find the number of socks Peter has:

* S = 2 * (2D) = 4D
* S = 4 * 60 = 240

We can now substitute the value of S into the first equation to find the number of socks Jack has:

* J = 2 * D
* J = 2 * 60 = 120

Finally, we can calculate the total number of socks and dishes:

* Total socks = S + J = 240 + 120 = 360
* Total dishes = D + J = 60 + 120 = 180

Therefore, Peter and Jack have a total of 360 socks and 180 dishes.

"Brenda's investment will accumulate to $975 after 3 years.  

Here's how to calculate the total amount:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + rt) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (the annual interest rate is 3/4 of the principal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic representation.  

Let 'J' represent the number of notebooks Joseph has and 'M' represent the number Martha has. We know:

*  J = 3M  (Joseph has 3 times the number of notebooks Martha has)
* M + 5 = 7 (Martha now has 7 notebooks after buying 5 more)

To find the difference between their notebook counts, we can solve for M and then subtract the value of M from Joseph's total.

1. **Solve for M:**
   From the second equation, we can isolate M:
   M = 7 - 5 = 2

2. **Substitute M into the first equation:**
   J = 3 * 2 = 6

3. **Calculate the difference:**
   The difference between Joseph's notebooks (J) and Martha's notebooks (M) is 6 - 2 = 4.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of proportions. 

* **Let 'x' represent the number of yards of material needed for a small mask.**
* **Let 'y' represent the number of yards of material needed for a large mask.**

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** 2x = 4y  (4 yards of material are used for 2 small masks)
* **Equation 2:** 2.25y = 3x (2.25 yards of material are used for 3 large masks)

Now, we can solve for 'x' and 'y' using a system of equations.  

**Solving for 'x' in Equation 1:**
* 2x = 4y
* x = 2y/2
* x = y

**Substituting 'x' in Equation 2:**
* 2.25y = 3(y)
* 2.25y = 3y
* 2.25y - 3y = 0
* -0.75y = 0
* y = 0

**Substituting the value of 'y' back into Equation 1:**
* 2x = 4(0)
* 2x = 0
* x = 0

**Therefore, we have a contradiction. This means there is no solution that satisfies both equations.**

* Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd'
* Let Adam's current age be represented by 'a'

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1.  **Duncan's age eight years ago:** d - 8 = 2(a - 4) 
2.  **Duncan's current age:** d = 60

Now we can solve for 'a' (Adam's current age) using the second equation:

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'r' represent the number of red balloons.
* Let 'y' represent the number of yellow balloons.

We know the following:

*  The total number of balloons is r + y.
*  The total number of bologna thrown is 2r + 3y.

We are given that the total number of bologna thrown is 58, and that 20 of the balloons are red.  This translates to the following system of equations:

*  r + y = total balloons
*  2r + 3y = total bologna

We can use the first equation to solve for 'r' in terms of 'y':
* r = total balloons - y

Substitute this value of 'r' into the second equation:
* 2(total balloons - y) + 3y = total bologna

Simplify and solve for 'y':
* 2 * total balloons - 2y + 3y = total bologna
* 2 * total balloons + y = total bologna
* 2 * (r + y) + y = total bologna
* 2r + 3y = total bologna

We know that the total bologna is 58.  We also know that 20 of the balloons are red.  Substitute these values into the equation:

* 2r + 3y = 58
* 2 * 20 + 3y = 58

Simplify and solve for 'y':
* 40 + 3y = 58
* 3y = 18
* y = 6

Therefore, there are **6** yellow balloons in the bundle.

* We know Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Marcus's age is L/2.
* We also know Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, meaning Marcus is L/2 - 5 years old.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old.  We can now set up an equation:

L/2 - 5 = 26

Solving for L:

1. Add 5 to both sides: L/2 = 31
2. Multiply both sides by 2: L = 62

Therefore, Leo is 62 years old.

"To determine Azibo's score, we can utilize a system of equations. Let's represent the scores of Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as variables:

*  Let D represent Dinar's score.
*  Let A represent Azibo's score.
*  Let B represent Bahati's score.

We are given the following information:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to eliminate B:

*  (A + 20) = (D + 10) 
*  A = D + 10 - 20
*  A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

To find Azibo's score (A), substitute the value of D back into the equation A = D - 10:

* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** Jonathan has 2/3 the number of measuring spoons as measuring cups. This means the ratio of measuring spoons to cups is 2:3.
* **Calculating the Number of Measuring Spoons:**  Since he has 2 dozen cups, we can find the number of measuring spoons by using the ratio.  
    * A dozen has 12 items, so he has (2/3) * 12 = 8 measuring spoons.
* **Calculating the Total Number of Utensils:**  Jonathan has 2 dozen cups + 8 measuring spoons = 32 utensils.
* **Adjusting for the Gift:**  He gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so he has 32 - 6 = 26 utensils remaining.

"The hospital's occupancy rate is 20% (1/5).  To determine the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to consider the total number of beds and the number of patients admitted.

* **Total beds occupied:** 1000 beds * 0.20 = 200 beds
* **Total patients admitted in 2 weeks:** 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients
* **Total unoccupied beds:** 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 unoccupied beds

**Therefore, the hospital has 300 unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'J' represent the number of balls Jordan carried.
* Let 'Z' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
* Let 'A' represent the number of balls Jason carried.

We know the following:

* J = 2A  (Jordan carried twice as many as Jason)
* A = Z  (Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey)

We also know that the total number of balls is 7.  

Therefore, we can express this as:

* J + Z + A = 7

Substituting the values we know:

* 2A + Z + A = 7
* 3A + Z = 7

We can further simplify this by substituting A = Z:

* 3Z + Z = 7
* 4Z = 7
* Z = 7/4

Since we know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, we can find the number of balls Jeffrey carried:

* Z = 7/4

Now, we can find the number of balls Jordan carried:

* J = 2A = 2 * (7/4) = 7/2

Finally, we can find the total number of balls brought to practice:

* Total balls = J + Z + A = (7/2) + (7/4) + (7/4) = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + 7/4 = 7/2 + 7/2 + "

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get. 
* The total number of corn chips is represented by 2x + 125.

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  

*  Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2x + 125 = 265

Now, solve for 'x':

* Subtract 125 from both sides: 2x = 140
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 70

This means each of the two people gets 70 corn chips.

* To find the total number of corn chips, we use the equation: 2x + 125 = 2(70) + 125 = 140 + 125 = 265

"To solve for Stan's catch, we can utilize a system of equations.  Let's represent the number of Pokemon each individual has caught:

*  Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following system of equations:

1.  A = S + 5 
2.  S = 4W - 13
3.  A + S + W = 339

We can solve for S (Stan's catch) by substituting the first two equations into the third equation:

*  (S + 5) + S + W = 339
*  2S + W = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:

*  2(4W - 13) + W = 339
*  8W - 26 + W = 339
*  9W - 26 = 339
*  9W = 365
*  W = 40.56

We can then substitute the value of W back into the second equation to find S:

*  S = 4(40.56) - 13

"The time required to string all the racquets can be determined by considering the relative frequency of each stringing type.  

* **Synthetic Gut:** 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
* **Polyester:** 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
* **Hybrid:** 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

To calculate the total time, we can use the concept of weighted averages.  The weighted average time is calculated by multiplying the time for each stringing type by its corresponding number of racquets and then summing the results. 

Total time = (45 minutes * 3) + (110 minutes * 5) + (72 minutes * 4) = 135 + 550 + 288 = 973 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Andy **973 minutes** to string all the racquets.

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic approach.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of states in the USA.** 
* **India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has x/2 + 4 states.**

To find the total number of states, we need to add the number of states in both countries:

* **Total states = USA states + India states**
* **Total states = x + (x/2 + 4)**

Now, we can solve for x:

* **Total states = (3x/2) + 4**

We know the total number of states is 79.  Let's set up an equation:

* **79 = (3x/2) + 4**

Solve for x:

* **79 - 4 = (3x/2)**
* **75 = (3x/2)**
* **75 * 2/3 = x**
* **50 = x**

Therefore, the USA has 50 states.

**Answer:** 
* **The USA has 50 states.** 
* **India has 29 states.**
* **The total number of states in both countries together is 79.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Richard has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
* We know that the total number of cherries is 60: R + J + 30 = 60
* We also know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard: R = J + 10

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(J + 10) + J + 30 = 60

Combine like terms: 2J + 40 = 60

Subtract 40 from both sides: 2J = 20

Divide both sides by 2: J = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find Robert's cherries:

R = J + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20

Finally, we can determine the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

Robert has 20 - 10 = 10 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down Sunny's sales problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'g' represent the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday.
* Let 'a' represent the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday.
* Let 's' represent the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday.
* Let 'p' represent the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  g + a = 10  (Saturday's gingerbread and apple pie sales)
*  a = g - 4  (Sunday's apple pie sales are 4 fewer than Saturday's)
*  s = g + 5  (Sunday's gingerbread sales are 5 more than Saturday's)
*  p = 15  (Sunday's apple pie sales)

Now, we can solve for the total earnings:

* **Saturday's Earnings:** 6g + 15a = 6(10) + 15(a-4) = 60 + 15a - 60 = 15a
* **Sunday's Earnings:** 15s + 15p = 15(g+5) + 15(15) = 15g + 75 + 225 = 15g + 300

**Total Earnings:** 15a + 15g + 300

**Therefore, Sunny's total earnings for two days is 15a + 15g + 300.** 

**Answer:** 15a + 15g + 300

*  f = 2 * e  (Emil's father will be twice Emil's age when Emil turns 24)
*  b = 2 * e / 2 (Emil's brother will be twice Emil's age when Emil turns 24)

We can now solve for the ages of Emil's father and brother.

*  f = 2 * 19 = 38
*  b = 2 * 19 / 2 = 19

Finally, to find the sum of their ages, we add their current ages:

* **Monthly Savings:** 25% of $2,000.00 = $500.00
* **Shoes per Month:** $2,000.00 / $1,000.00 per shoe = 2 shoes
* **Annual Purchases:** 2 shoes/month * 12 months/year = 24 shoes

Therefore, Jessica can purchase **24** pairs of shoes in a year.

"To determine the time required to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the process into two distinct steps:

**Step 1: Peeling Time**

* Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
* To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

**Step 2: Cooking Time**

* Emily cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
* To cook 90 shrimp, the time required is 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 minutes.

**Step 3: Total Time**

* The total time required is the sum of peeling and cooking time: 15 minutes + 3 minutes = 18 minutes.


Therefore, it will take Emily **18 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"The air conditioner's cooling effect can be analyzed by considering the cumulative temperature change over time. 

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a total cooling of 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
* **High setting:** The air conditioner cooled the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, resulting in a total cooling of 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
* **Combined cooling:** The total cooling effect of the air conditioner is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

To determine the final temperature, we need to consider the room's initial temperature and the cooling effect.  The room was 2 degrees warmer without the air conditioner, so the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature. 

**Final answer:** 18 degrees lower.

"Let's break down the problem using a fractional representation of the flights.

* **Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.**

* **Flights to Greece:** The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.

* **Flights to France and Germany:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany.  

* **Flights to Poland:** The other plane flies to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

* **The other plane's trips are half the first plane's trips:** 22 = (1/2) * x
* **Solving for x:** x = 22 * 2 = 44

**Therefore, the first plane makes 44 flights in a day.**

"The total time the wolves howl is calculated as follows:

* Tobias: 20 seconds
* Chikote: 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds
* Igneous: 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Therefore, the total howl time is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

To express this in minutes, we divide the total seconds by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"To determine Adam's contribution, we need to consider the total amount of money he received from his parents and the amount he spent on the trousers. 

* **Total from parents:** Adam received $18 from his parents.
* **Cost of trousers:** Adam spent $30 on the trousers.
* **Contribution from savings:**  To find Adam's contribution, we subtract the total amount received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers.  Therefore, Adam contributed $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

**Answer:** $12

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let  'x' represent Wilfred's age.
* We know Helene's age is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (5) = 10 years.
* The total age of the group is 20 years.
* We also know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Now, we can set up the following system of equations:

*  x + 10 + 3 + 4 = 20 
*  x = 20 - 10 - 3 - 4

Solving for x:

* x + 10 + 3 + 4 = 20
* x + 17 = 20
* x = 20 - 17
* x = 3

Therefore, Wilfred is **3 years old**.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of proportions.  

* **Define the unknown:**  We are looking for the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives.  Let's represent the size of a kid's slice as 'x'. 
* **Set up the proportion:**  The ratio of the size of an adult's slice to the size of a kid's slice is 2:1. This can be represented as: 
   *  Adult's slice / Kid's slice = 2/1
* **Solve for the unknown:**  We know the total slices are 6.  Therefore, we can set up a proportion:
   * (2x) / (x) = 6
* **Simplify and solve:**  Simplifying the equation, we get:
   * 2 = 6
* **Express the answer as a percentage:**  We can express the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets as:
   * (2x / 6) * 100% 
   *  (x/3) * 100%


**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/3) * 100%.**

"Doctor Jones has a total of 9 hours to dedicate to his clinic duties.  He will spend 180 minutes on rounds and 300 minutes on appointments.  

To determine the remaining time for record updates, we need to calculate the total time spent on rounds and appointments. 

* **Rounds:** 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/patient = 180 minutes
* **Appointments:** 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes
* **Total time:** 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

To find the remaining time for record updates, we subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time available:

* **Time remaining:** 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes
* **Time remaining after rounds and appointments:** 540 minutes - 480 minutes = 60 minutes

"The Smith family's pool requires a volume calculation to determine the amount of water needed.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the pool.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth.  

* Length = 25 feet
* Width = 14 feet
* Depth = 4 feet

Therefore, the volume is calculated as:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

To convert cubic feet to gallons, we use the conversion factor of 7.48 gallons per cubic foot.  

Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
Volume in gallons = 10392 gallons

Finally, the cost to fill the pool is calculated by multiplying the volume in gallons by the price per gallon, which is $0.10.

Cost = Volume in gallons x Price per gallon
Cost = 10392 gallons x $0.10/gallon
Cost = $1039.20

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $1039.20.

"Let's break down this problem using a rate of change approach.  

We know the power bank's capacity is decreasing over time.  We can model this with a function that represents the remaining charge as a function of time. 

* **Initial Charge:**  Let's assume the initial charge is represented by 'C(0)' and we know it's 100%.
* **Rate of Change:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for the first 5 hours, which can be represented as a rate of change of -0.09.
* **Second Rate of Change:** After 5 hours, the rate of change changes to -0.07 per hour for the next 3 hours.

To find the initial charge, we need to find the function that describes the remaining charge as a function of time. 

**Let's use the following equation:**

* **C(t) = C(0) - 0.09t**  where t is the time in hours.

**To find the initial charge, we need to find the value of C(0).**

**To find C(0), we can use the information given in the problem:**

* **C(5) = 55%** 

**Solving for C(0):**

* **55 = C(0) - 0.09(5)**
* **55 = C(0) - 0.45**
* **C(0) = 55 + 0.45**
* **C(0) = 55.45**

**Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 55.45%.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
* Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we have the equation: 2x represents the number of small stuffed animals sold.

* The price of a large stuffed animal is $12.  
* The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
* The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12x.
* The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.
* The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

"The problem presents a straightforward scenario for calculating the total ore mined by a group of dwarves.  

First, we need to determine the daily ore production of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe.  We know that a dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.  A steel pickaxe mines 1.5 times the amount of an iron pickaxe, so the daily production of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe is 12 pounds * 1.5 = 18 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month.  Since each dwarf mines 18 pounds per day, the total daily production of 40 dwarves is 18 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds.

Finally, we need to determine the total ore mined in a month.  A month has 30 days, so the total ore mined is 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds.

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of balls retrieved in the first set.

We can represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  The problem states that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than the second set. This translates to:

* First set: x + 4

The third set had half the number of balls retrieved in the second set, which is represented as x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is 19.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation:

* Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

This means Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we can use the equation:

* First set: x + 4

Substituting the value of x, we get:

"To determine the speed of the faster car, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships.  

* **Understanding the Relationship:** The problem states that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car. This means the ratio of the faster car's speed to the second fastest car's speed is 1.25.

* **Setting up the Proportion:** Let 'x' represent the speed of the second fastest car.  We can set up a proportion:

   (Faster Car Speed) / (Second Fastest Car Speed) = 1.25

* **Solving for the Faster Car Speed:**  We know the second fastest car's speed is 'x' and the faster car's speed is 1.25 times that.  Therefore:

   (Faster Car Speed) / x = 1.25

* **Solving for the Faster Car Speed:** To isolate the faster car's speed, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 'x':

   (Faster Car Speed) = 1.25x

* **Using the Average Car Speed:** We are given that the average car's speed is 120 mph.  We can use this information to find the value of 'x'.

   x = 120 mph * 5 = 600 mph

* **Calculating the Faster Car Speed:** Now that we know the second fastest car's speed, we can substitute it back into the equation:

   Faster Car Speed = 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph


**Answer:** The faster car goes 750 mph.

"Let's break down this word problem using a simple algebraic representation. 

Let 'x' represent Vince's current age.  We know that two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. This translates to the equation:

* Liam's age two years ago: x - 2
* Vince's age two years ago: x - 2

We are given that Liam's age two years ago was equal to twice Vince's age two years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:

* x - 2 = 2(x - 2)

Now, let's solve for x:

1. x - 2 = 2x - 4
2. -x = -2
3. x = 2

Therefore, Vince is currently 2 years old.

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations.  Let's represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as 'x' and 'y' respectively.  We are given the following information:

*  x + y = 56 (The total number of eggs painted)
*  x = y (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs)
*  y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12 (Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs)

Solving for 'y' in the second equation:
*  y + y + 12 = 2y + 12
*  2y + 12 = 2y + 12
*  This equation is true for any value of 'y'.

Now, we can substitute the value of 'y' into the first equation:
*  x + x = 56
*  2x = 56
*  x = 28

Since we know that x = y, then y = 28.

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we can use the information given in the third equation:
*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 28 + 12 = 40 eggs.

Therefore, the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 40 - 28 = 12.


**Answer:** Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break down the problem using the concepts of distance, rate, and time.

* **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the speed (in miles per hour) Grandma walks on the beach.
    *  Let 'y' represent the speed (in miles per hour) Grandma walks on the sidewalk.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know that the total distance is 3 miles.
    *  Distance on beach = 2 miles
    *  Distance on sidewalk = 1 mile
    *  Total time = 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours

* **Formulate the relationship between speed and time:**
    *  Time = Distance / Speed
    *  Time on beach = 2 miles / x 
    *  Time on sidewalk = 1 mile / y

* **Utilize the given information about the sidewalk speed:**
    *  We know that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, so y = 2x

* **Solve for the speed on the beach:**
    *  We can substitute the value of y in the time equation for the sidewalk: 2/3 = 1/x
    *  Solving for x, we get x = 3/2 = 1.5 miles per hour

* **Solve for the speed on the sidewalk:**
    *  We know y = 2x, so y = 2 * 1.5 = 3 miles per hour

* **Calculate the total time:**
    *  Total time = (Distance on beach / speed on beach) + (Distance on sidewalk / speed on sidewalk)
    *  Total time = (2 miles / 1.5 miles per hour) + (1 mile / 3 miles per hour)
    *  Total time = 1.33 hours

* **Convert the total time to minutes:**
    *  Total time = 1.33 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 80 minutes

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of sunflowers sold.
* Let 'y' represent the number of bouquets sold.

We know the following:

*  Equation 1:  2x + 8y = 26 (The total earnings from sunflowers and bouquets)
*  Equation 2: 12y = 56 (The earnings from bouquets)

From Equation 2, we can solve for 'y':
* y = 56 / 12 = 4.67 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a bouquet, we'll assume Faraday sold 5 bouquets.

Now, substitute the value of 'y' into Equation 1:
* 2x + 8(5) = 26

Simplify and solve for 'x':
* 2x + 40 = 26
* 2x = -14
* x = -7

"Let's break down the problem using a single-variable linear equation.  

We are given that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age.  This translates to the following equation:

*  Geb's age = (Haley's age / 2) - 10

We know Haley's age is 26. Substituting this into the equation:

* Geb's age = (26 / 2) - 10
* Geb's age = 13 - 10
* Geb's age = 3

Therefore, Geb is **3 years old**.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios and proportions.

* **Let 'x' represent the amount of money Ronnie had initially.**
* **Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x dollars.**

* **After each of them gave an equal amount to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money remaining. This translates to a ratio of 4/5 representing the fraction of her original amount she has left.**

* **We can express this mathematically as: (3x - 3) / (3x) = 4/5**

* **Solving for x:**
    * Cross-multiply: 5(3x - 3) = 4(3x)
    * Expand: 15x - 15 = 12x
    * Simplify: 3x = 15
    * Solve for x: x = 5

"Alice's cloud counting follows a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.  To find the total number of clouds, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (3 puffs)
* r = the common ratio (2)
* n = the number of terms (5 days)

Substituting the values:

S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

Therefore, Alice will have counted a total of **93** puffs across all five days.

"The problem presents a system of two linear equations that can be solved using substitution or elimination.  Let's utilize the substitution method.

From the first equation, we can express Wendy's current age (W) in terms of Colin's current age (C):

W = 5(C + 7)

Now, substitute this expression for W into the second equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Simplify and solve for C:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
(-2/3)C = -5
C = 15/2

Therefore, Colin is currently 15/2 years old, which simplifies to 7.5 years old.

"To determine the time it takes Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds and melts snowballs. 

* **Building Rate:** Jay builds 1/3 snowball per minute.
* **Melting Rate:** He melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes.

To find the time to reach 60 snowballs, we need to consider the net change in his snowball count.  

**Strategy:**

1. **Calculate the time to build 60 snowballs:**  We need to determine the number of minutes it takes to build 60 snowballs. 
2. **Account for melting:** We need to account for the melting of snowballs.

**Solution:**

1. **Building Time:**  
   *  Since he builds 1/3 snowball per minute, to build 60 snowballs, it will take 60 / (1/3) = 180 minutes.

2. **Melting Time:**
   *  He melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. 
   *  To reach 60 snowballs, he needs to build 60 - 2 = 58 snowballs. 
   *  To account for the melting, we need to determine the number of 15-minute intervals it takes to melt 58 snowballs. 
   *  This is a bit tricky, as we need to consider the number of times he melts snowballs. 

**Conclusion:**

*  The time it takes Jay to build 60 snowballs is 180 minutes.

"To determine the number of calls Jason needs to make to achieve his sales goal, we can utilize a direct proportion.  

Let's break down the relationship between calls and customers:

* **Conversion Rate:** Jason converts 1 customer for every 25 calls.

* **Target Customers:** Jason needs to convert 15 cars, which translates to 15 customers.

To find the number of calls required, we can set up a proportion:

"The cost of the main phone is represented by the variable 'x'.  The cost of each additional phone is represented by the variable 'y'.  We know that the total cost of the plan is $20.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 4y = 20

We also know that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so we can express the cost of the main phone as 2y.  Substituting this into our equation, we get:

2y + 4y = 20

Combining like terms, we get:

6y = 20

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

y = 20/6 = 10/3

Since y represents the cost of each additional phone, we can substitute this value back into our equation to find the cost of the main phone:

x = 2 * (10/3) = 20/3

Therefore, the total cost of the phone plan is:

20/3 + 4 * (10/3) = 20/3 + 40/3 = 60/3 = 20

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

* **Formulate Equations:**
    * We know Igor gathered half the requested number of test tubes: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    * We know he gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    * The total number of items on the bench is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the Number of Beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * This simplifies to 24 + beakers = 29
    * Subtracting 24 from both sides: beakers = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of proportions. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
    * Let 'y' represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.

* **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Vanessa's speed is twice Aaron's speed:  x = 2y
    * We know Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 2 miles:  4/x = 2/y

* **Solve for Vanessa's time:**
    * Substitute the first equation (x = 2y) into the second equation: 4/(2y) = 2/y
    * Simplify: 2/y = 2/y
    * Since the left and right sides are equal, we can conclude that Vanessa's speed is 2y. 
    * We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we can solve for y: 4/2 = 2y
    * Simplify: 2 = 2y
    * Solve for y: y = 1 mile per minute.

* **Find Vanessa's time:**
    * Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of 1 mile per minute. 
    * Therefore, Vanessa took 4 miles / 1 mile per minute = 4 minutes.

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let's represent the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'.  

We are given the following system of equations:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70  (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for 'c', we can use substitution.  From the first equation, we can isolate 'w':

* w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
