"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

The ratio 7:11 represents a proportional relationship between their ages.  This means that for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.  

Let's denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x.  We know their combined age is 162.  

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

Solving for x:
* 18x = 162
* x = 162 / 18
* x = 9

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we need to understand the relationship between the number of silver and gold coins.  

Let's represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of her silver and gold coins.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

* **Total coins = Silver coins + Gold coins**
* **110 = x + (x + 30)**

This equation represents the total number of coins Gretchen has, which is 110.  

Solving for 'x', we can simplify the equation:

* **110 = 2x + 30**
* **80 = 2x**
* **x = 40**

Now that we know 'x' (the number of silver coins) is 40, we can calculate the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70**

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 


**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper, and an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon.  To determine the total cost, we need to consider the cost of each fruit and the quantities purchased.

* **Watermelons:**  A watermelon costs $45. Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the cost is 4 * $45 = $180.
* **Peppers:** Dillon buys 20 peppers at $15 each, so the cost is 20 * $15 = $300.
* **Oranges:**  An orange costs $40. Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the cost is 10 * $40 = $400.

The total cost of the fruits is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"The hive's population is a classic example of a complex ecological balance.  Let's break down the bee population dynamics:

* **Queens:**  The queen bee is the reproductive center of the hive, responsible for laying eggs.  
* **Worker Bees:** These are the industrious bees responsible for tasks like foraging, brood care, and hive maintenance. 
* **Baby Bees (Larvae):**  These are the young bees that are in the process of developing into worker bees.

The relationship between these bee types is crucial for the hive's survival.  

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2b**

Where:
* **w** represents the number of worker bees
* **b** represents the number of baby bees

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700.  We can use this information to solve for the number of baby bees (b) and then calculate the number of worker bees (w). 


**Let's solve:**

1. **Queens:**  We know that the number of queens (q) is 100.
2. **Baby Bees:**  The number of baby bees (b) is twice the number of queens, so b = 2 * 100 = 200.
3. **Worker Bees:**  The number of worker bees (w) is twice the number of baby bees, so w = 2 * 200 = 400.


**Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.**

"Let's break down this age problem.  

We know that Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.  This means that Seth's age is represented by 2 times Brooke's age.  In two years, their ages will add up to 28. 

Let's represent Brooke's current age with the variable ""B"" and Seth's current age with the variable ""S"".  We can set up an equation to represent this:

* S = 2B 
* S + B + 2 = 28

We can solve for Brooke's age (B) by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

* (2B) + B + 2 = 28
* 3B + 2 = 28
* 3B = 26
* B = 8.67 (approximately)

"It's important to understand that the probability of an event is a measure of how likely it is to occur.  

To determine the likelihood of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we need to consider the total possible outcomes.  There are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, or 1/2. This is because there are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) and six total possible outcomes.

Now, let's consider the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.  There are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) on a six-sided die.  The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, or 1/2.  The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.  This is equivalent to 25%.

"The trader's profit is a result of the difference between the selling price and the cost of acquiring and transporting the wheat.  

To determine the number of bags sold, we can set up an equation:

* **Profit = (Selling Price per Bag * Number of Bags) - (Cost per Bag * Number of Bags) - (Transportation Cost per Bag * Number of Bags)**

We know the following:

* **Profit:** $400
* **Selling Price per Bag:** $30

"To determine the flour needed for Carla's cookies, we need to consider the relationship between flour and the number of cookies.  

A standard recipe for cookies typically uses 2 cups of flour per dozen cookies.  

* **Total cookies:** Carla is baking 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, totaling 66 cookies.
* **Flour needed:**  To calculate the total flour needed, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen: 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens. 
* **Flour calculation:** Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, Carla will need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

"To determine the total time required for cooking chicken, we need to consider the time spent heating the oil and the time needed for cooking. 

* **Heating:** The oil takes 20 minutes to reach 300 degrees Fahrenheit. 
* **Heating to 400 degrees:**  The additional time to reach 400 degrees is 40% of the time to reach 300 degrees, which is 20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes.  Therefore, the total time to reach 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.
* **Cooking:** The time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

**Total time:** 20 minutes (heating) + 28 minutes (heating to 400) + 23 minutes (cooking) = **71 minutes**

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we need to consider the relationship between the offense, special teams, and the total number of players. 

Let's break it down:

* **Defense:**  We know the defense is represented by 'x' players.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so it has 2x players.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning they have x/2 players.

The total number of players on the team is 105.  We can express this mathematically as:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation:

(7/2)x = 105

Multiplying both sides by (2/7) gives us:

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"Erin's current score of 14 points represents a significant increase from her baseline.  To determine her pre-score, we need to consider the relationship between her current score and Sara's score.  

We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.  Therefore, we can calculate Erin's pre-score by considering the following:

* **Erin's current score:** 14 points
* **Sara's score:** 8 points
* **Ratio:** Erin's score is 3 times greater than Sara's score.

To find Erin's pre-score, we can use the following equation:

Erin's pre-score = (Erin's current score) / (Ratio)

Erin's pre-score = 14 points / 3 = 4.67 points.

Therefore, Erin had approximately 4.67 points before the current score.

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of animal population dynamics. 

We know that camels and dromedaries are both members of the Camelidae family.  The key to solving this is understanding the unique characteristics of each species. 

* **Camels** are known for their distinctive hump, which is a storage organ for fat. They have two humps.
* **Dromedaries** are a type of camel with a single hump.

The total number of heads (representing the number of individuals) is 180.  We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. 

Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** c + d = 180 (The total number of heads)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break down this scenario from a nutritional perspective.  

We know George spent $5.00, and this included the cost of 3 bags of chips, which is a common snack food high in sodium and fat.  He also purchased candy bars, which are often high in sugar and calories.  

To determine the number of candy bars he bought, we need to consider the cost of the candy bars.  We can calculate this by subtracting the cost of the chips from his total spending. 

* **Cost of chips:** 3 bags * $0.40/bag = $1.20
* **Money remaining:** $5.00 - $1.20 = $3.80
* **Cost of candy bars:** $3.80

To determine the number of candy bars, we divide the remaining money by the cost per candy bar.

* **Number of candy bars:** $3.80 / $0.75/candy bar = 5.07 candy bars.

Since you can't buy parts of candy bars, George likely bought **5** candy bars.

**Venue 1:**

* **Fixed Cost:** $200 (flat fee)
* **Variable Cost:** $5 per guest (food)

**Venue 2:**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Data:** We're given that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.  We need to figure out how many insects Lily found.

* **Using a Variable:**  Let's use 'x' to represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

* **Calculating David's Insects:** David found half of Bodhi's insects, so he found x/2 insects.

* **Lily's Insects:** Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **The Equation:**  The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solving for x:**  
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Finding Lily's Insects:**  Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"The question presents a classic example of a ratio problem.  Let's break it down:

* **Understanding the Ratios:** The key is to recognize that the problem uses percentages to describe the relationship between the jelly bean colors.  This means we can use ratios to represent the proportions of each color.

* **Setting up the Equation:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  We know that the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans.  

* **Solving for the Number of Blue Jelly Beans:**  We can set up an equation to represent the total number of jelly beans:

   b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

* **Solving for the Number of Jelly Beans:**  Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500.  Dividing both sides by 2.99, we find that b = 1500.

* **Calculating the Difference:**  To find the difference in the number of green jelly beans compared to red jelly beans, we can use the following:

   Green jelly beans - Red jelly beans = (1.01 * 1500) - (0.99 * 1500) = 1515 - 1495 = 20

* **Legs:**  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  
* **Heads:**  We know the total number of heads is 20.

Let's use a system of equations to represent this:

*  Let 's' represent the number of sheep.

"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we need to consider the relationship between pears and bananas.  

* **Understanding the Proportion:**  We know George has 45% more pears than bananas. This means the proportion of pears to bananas is 1.45 (since 45% is equivalent to 0.45).

* **Calculating the Total:**  We can use this proportion to calculate the total number of fruits.  

Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' represent the total number of fruits George has.**
* **We know:** 
    *  Bananas: x - 200
    *  Pears: x * 1.45 

* **Setting up the equation:**  The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of bananas and pears:
   x = (x - 200) + (x * 1.45)

* **Solving for x:**
   x = x - 200 + 1.45x
   0.45x = 200
   x = 200 / 0.45
   x = 444.44

**Therefore, George has approximately 444.44 fruits.**

    * *x* = 65.8

* **Finding the Number of Cards for Becca:**  We know that *B* = *S* + 12.  Since *S* = 3 * *x*, we can substitute to find *B*:
    * *B* = 3 * 65.8 + 12
    * *B* = 197.4 + 12
    * *B* = 209.4

* **Important Note:**  We need to consider the number of cards as a whole number.  Therefore, we can assume that Becca has 209 cards.

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to consider the relationship between the team members' points.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Bahati's score is 20 more than Azibo's and 10 more than Dinar's.** This means we can represent Bahati's score as (A + 20) and Dinar's score as (D).

* **The total points for the team is 45.**  

We can set up an equation to represent this:

A + D + B = 45

Substituting the values we know:

A + D + (A + 20) = 45

Simplifying the equation:

2A + D + 20 = 45

We can solve for D:

D = 45 - 2A - 20

D = 25 - 2A

We can substitute this value of D back into the equation for A:

A = (25 - 2A) - 10

A = 15 - 2A

3A = 15

A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"Let's break down this Pokemon puzzle!

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are working together to catch all the Pokemon.  We can represent their catches with variables:

* **A:**  The number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
* **S:** The number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
* **W:** The number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We can set up equations based on the information given:

* **A = S + 5:**  Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
* **S = 4W - 13:** Stan has 13 fewer Pokemon than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.
* **A + S + W = 339:**  The total number of Pokemon they have caught is 339.

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught, we need to solve for 'S'.  Let's use the first two equations to help us:

1. **Substitute:** Since we know A = S + 5, we can substitute that into the third equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify:** Combine the 'S' terms:
   2S + W + 5 = 339

3. **Substitute again:** We know S = 4W - 13, so substitute that in:
   2(4W - 13) + W + 5 = 339

4. **Solve for W:** Simplify and solve for 'W':
   8W - 26 + W + 5 = 339
   9W - 21 = 339
   9W = 360
   W = 40.56 

5. **Find S:** Now that we know W, we can find S:
   S = 4(40.56) - 13
   S = 162.24 - 13
   S = 149.24

**Therefore, Stan has caught approximately 149 Pokemon.**

"The wolves' howling behavior is a fascinating aspect of their social communication.  

To determine the total time spent howling, we need to consider the duration of each wolf's howl and the combined time.

* **Tobias:**  Each howl lasts 20 seconds.
* **Chikote:** Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, so it lasts 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

We know Teresa sells stuffed animals, and we need to determine the number of small stuffed animals she sold.  

* **Let's consider the relationship between the types of stuffed animals:**  We know Teresa sells large stuffed animals at three times the price of small stuffed animals. 
* **We also know the price of each small stuffed animal:**  Each small stuffed animal costs $4. 

**To find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we can use the following steps:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.
   * Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can say the number of large stuffed animals sold is 'x/2'.

2. **Set up an equation:**
   * The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * (x/2) = 2x.
   * The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 3 * (x/2) = 3x/2.
   * The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120.  So, 2x + 3x/2 = $120

3. **Solve for x:**
   * Combine like terms: (4x/2) + (3x/2) = $120
   * Simplify: 7x/2 = $120
   * Multiply both sides by 2/7: x = 6

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"It's important to consider the long-term health implications of pursuing higher education. While a college degree can lead to increased earning potential, it's crucial to weigh the financial and personal costs against the potential benefits. 

To determine the time it takes to recoup the cost of college, we need to consider the following:

* **Loan Repayment:**  The $50,000 annual loan payments represent a significant financial commitment. 
* **Lost Income:**  The time spent in college means a period of reduced income, which needs to be factored into the calculation.

**To determine the time to recoup the cost of college, we need to consider the following:**

* **Total Loan Repayment:** $50,000 per year * 4 years = $200,000
* **Total Lost Income:** $25,000 per year * 4 years = $100,000

**Total to Earn:** $200,000 (loan repayment) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

**Time to Earn:** $300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years.

"Let's break down this problem from a financial perspective.  

We know the total amount is $1920, and the three individuals received a portion of this sum.  

* **Understanding the Shares:**  The second person received $80 more than the first, and the third person received twice the amount the second person received. This suggests a pattern of increasing amounts.

* **Setting up the Equation:**  We can represent the shares as follows:
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.
    *  The second person received x + $80.
    *  The third person received 2(x + $80).

* **Solving for the First Person's Share:**  The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person.  We can set up an equation to solve for 'x':
    * (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

* **Solving for 'x':**
    * (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
    * 4x + $160 = $5760
    * 4x = $5600
    * x = $1400

* **Second set:**  We know Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. 
* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved 6 / 2 = 3 balls in the third set.

Now, let's calculate the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

* **Total balls = Balls in first set + Balls in second set + Balls in third set**
* **19 = (Balls in first set) + 6 + 3**
* **19 = (Balls in first set) + 9**
* **(Balls in first set) = 19 - 9 = 10**

"Let's consider the time allocation for this meal preparation.  

We know that the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.  We also know that Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  

To determine the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

* **Total time = Donovan's time + Betsy's time**

Let 'x' represent Donovan's time.  Betsy's time is then 'x + 18'.  We can set up the equation:

* **98 = x + (x + 18)**

Let's break it down:

* **Sam's fence:**  Sam has a portion of the fence, which we can represent as 'x' feet.
* **Harry's fence:** Harry has a portion of the fence, which is 'x + 60' feet.

The total fence length is 100 feet, so we can express this mathematically as:

    * North/South: 2 * (10 ft * 8 ft) = 160 square feet
    * East/West: 2 * (5 ft * 8 ft) = 80 square feet
    * Total Area: 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 square feet

* **Paint Coverage:** A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.

* **Gallons Needed:** To determine the number of gallons needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon: 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons.

* **Cost:**  The cost of the paint is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the price per gallon: 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.


**Therefore, the cost of painting the room is $144.**

"The time it takes to ride a waterslide is influenced by both the length of the slide and the speed at which one descends.  

To determine the difference in ride time, we can compare the time it takes to complete the longest slide to the time it takes to complete the second longest slide. 

The biggest slide is 300 feet long and people slide down at a speed of 60 feet per minute.  The second slide is 240 feet long and people slide down at a speed of 80 feet per minute. 

The time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

"The provided information allows us to calculate the total number of students in the school.  

* **Understanding the Proportion:**  We know that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. This means that the remaining 60% of the population represents the number of girls.

* **Calculating the Total Population:**  To find the total number of students, we can use the following equation:

   * Total Students = (Percentage of Boys / 100) * Total Population

* **Solving for the Total Population:**  We can then solve for the total population by using the given information about the percentage of boys. 

   * Total Students = (40/100) * Total Population
   * 240 = (40/100) * Total Population
   * 240 * 100 = 40 * Total Population
   * 24000 = 40 * Total Population
   * Total Population = 24000 / 40
   * Total Population = 600

* **Calculating the Number of Girls:**  The total population is 600 students, and we know that 40% are boys. Therefore, the number of girls is:

   * Number of Girls = Total Population - Number of Boys
   * Number of Girls = 600 - 240

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know the lengths of the ropes are related.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. 

* **Using the Information:**  We can represent the lengths of the ropes with variables:
    * Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    * The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
    * The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

* **The Total Length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  This means:
    x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

* **Solving for x:**
    * x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
    * 6x - 35 = 37
    * 6x = 72
    * x = 12

* **Finding the Length of the Red Rope:**  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so:
    * Red rope length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters


**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Colin is currently 12.5 years old. 

**Explanation:**

We can determine Colin's current age by understanding the relationship between his age now and his age in the future.  

* **Age in 7 years:**  Colin will be 12.5 + 7 = 19.5 years old in 7 years.
* **Age in 25 years:**  In 25 years, Colin will be 19.5 + 25 = 44.5 years old.

We can then use this information to solve for Colin's current age. 

Let's break down the problem:

"The question asks for the difference between Tim's estimated number of red jelly beans and the actual number.  

To determine this, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the volume of the jelly beans.  

* **Volume of the jar:** The jar is a rectangular prism with a base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.  Therefore, the volume of the jar is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

* **Volume of the jelly beans:**  The jelly beans are packed in the jar with an efficiency of 80%. This means that 80% of the space in the jar is actually occupied by the jelly beans.  The volume of the jelly beans is calculated by multiplying the volume of the jar by the packing efficiency.  Therefore, the volume of the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

* **Number of jelly beans:** The number of jelly beans is calculated by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.  The volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.  Therefore, the number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to consider the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies.  

Let's break it down:

* **Carly's brownies and cupcakes are related by a specific ratio.**  We know that the number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2. 

* **We also know that the total number of treats for the class is 10.**

**To find the number of cupcakes, we can use the following steps:**

1. **Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.**
2. **Let 'b' represent the number of brownies.**
3. **We know that b = 3c - 2**
4. **We also know that b + c = 10**

**Solving for 'c' in terms of 'b' from the first equation:**

* b = 3c - 2
* b + 2 = 3c
* c = (b + 2) / 3

**Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:**

* (b + 2) / 3 + b = 10

**Solving for 'b':**

* (b + 2) + 3b = 30
* 4b + 2 = 30
* 4b = 28
* b = 7

**Now that we know the number of brownies (b = 7), we can find the number of cupcakes (c):**

* c = (b + 2) / 3
* c = (7 + 2) / 3
* c = 9 / 3
* c = 3

**Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.**

"Let's break down this animal population problem. 

We know the total number of animals is 20, and we need to determine the number of chickens.  

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We can express this information as a system of equations:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for 'c', we can use a method called substitution.  

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
