"Let's break down the problem:

We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.

We're given their total age is 162.  Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively.  

The equation for their total age is: 7x + 11x = 162

Simplifying the equation: 18x = 162

Solving for x: x = 162 / 18 = 9

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11 * 9 = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for 'x', we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Since the number of gold coins is 'x + 30', we can calculate that Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Dana's speed is a key factor in this problem.  Let's break it down:

* **Running:** Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed.  This means her running speed is 4 * her walking speed.
* **Skipping:** Her skipping speed is half her running speed. 
* **Time Allocation:** She spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking.

**Calculations:**

* **Running Distance:**  
    * Distance = Speed * Time
    * Distance running = 4 * walking speed * (2/3) hours = (8/3) * walking speed
* **Walking Distance:**
    * Distance walking = 3 * (1/3) hours = 1 hour
    * Distance walking = 3 * (1/3) * walking speed = walking speed

**Total Distance:**
* Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
* Total distance = (8/3) * walking speed + walking speed

**To find the total distance, we need to know the walking speed.** 

**We know that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.  We can use this to find her walking speed.**

* **Walking speed = Skipping speed / 2**
* **Walking speed = 3 miles per hour / 2 = 1.5 miles per hour**

**Now we can calculate the total distance:**

* Total distance = (8/3) * 1.5 miles per hour + 1.5 miles per hour
* Total distance = 4 miles per hour + 1.5 miles per hour
* Total distance = 5.5 miles per hour

**Therefore, Dana can travel 5.5 miles in six hours.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald sold.
* Their combined sales are 88,000 copies.

To find out how many copies Harald sold, we can use the following equation:

* Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.
* Marilyn sold 10x copies.
* Their combined sales are x + 10x = 88,000

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's.  This means Gerald's time is the base, and we need to find his new time after his diet change.

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time was 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:**  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Calculate Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Katy's coffee recipe uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to work with the ratio.  

* **Step 1:  Understanding the Ratio**
   The ratio 7:13 represents the relationship between sugar and water.

* **Step 2:  Finding the Unit Value**
   We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find the value of one part of the ratio, we can set up a proportion: 
   7x = 120 teaspoons

* **Step 3: Solving for x**
   Divide both sides of the equation by 7:
   x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

* **Step 4: Calculating the Number of Cups of Water**
   Since the ratio is 7:13, we can use the value of 'x' to find the number of cups of water. 
   13 * 17.14 = 222.82 cups (approximately)

**Therefore, Katy used approximately 17.14 teaspoons of sugar.**

"The hive has a population of 700 bees.  To determine the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationship between the different bee categories. 

* **Queens:** The number of queens is a fundamental factor in the hive's structure and reproduction.
* **Baby Bees:** Baby bees are the youngest members of the hive, and their number directly influences the growth and development of the colony.
* **Worker Bees:** Worker bees are responsible for various tasks within the hive, including foraging, brood care, and hive maintenance.

The relationship between these bee categories is crucial for the hive's overall health and productivity.  

To find the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2b**

Where:
* **w** represents the number of worker bees
* **b** represents the number of baby bees

We can also express the number of baby bees in terms of the number of queens:

**b = 2q**

Now, we can substitute the value of 'b' in the first equation:

**w = 2 * (2q)**

**w = 4q**

Finally, we can substitute the value of 'q' to find the number of worker bees:

**w = 4 * 100**

**w = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

**Therefore, there were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Let's break down the fish catch:

* **Anakin:** Caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.
* **Locsin:** Caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish.

To calculate the total fish caught by Locsin, we need to consider the differences in their catches:

* **Starfish:** Anakin (10) - Locsin (5) = 5 fewer starfish caught by Locsin.
* **Seahorses:** Anakin (6) - Locsin (3) = 3 fewer seahorses caught by Locsin.
* **Clownfish:** Anakin (3) + Locsin (2) = 5 more clownfish caught by Locsin.

Therefore, Locsin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 5 = 21 fish.

"Based on the information provided, it's clear that hiring an accountant is the more financially advantageous option for Jackie.  

Here's why:

* **Tax preparation is a specialized field:** Accountants have the expertise to navigate complex tax laws and deductions, ensuring she maximizes her refund or minimizes her tax liability. 
* **Time is valuable:**  While Jackie might save time by doing her taxes herself, the potential for errors and missed deductions could lead to penalties or a lower refund. 
* **Cost-benefit analysis:**  While the accountant charges $90, the potential for a larger refund or avoiding penalties could outweigh the cost.

**Therefore, Jackie will likely save money by hiring an accountant.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.  
* In two years, their ages will sum to 28.

Let's use variables to represent their current ages:

*  Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'
*  Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

* S = 2B  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

**Solving for Seth's age:**

1. Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. Combine like terms:
   3B + 2 = 28

3. Subtract 2 from both sides:
   3B = 26

4. Divide both sides by 3:
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. Now that we know Brooke's age (B), we can find Seth's age:
   S = 2 * B
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"Zaid has a monthly income of $6000.  Let's break down his expenses:

* **Rent:** $6000 * (1/4) = $1500
* **Car Fuel:** $6000 * (1/3) = $2000
* **Total Expenses:** $1500 + $2000 = $3500

After covering these expenses, he has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He donates half of this remaining amount to charity, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

After the donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

Finally, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. This leaves him with $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* 60 seconds (first runner) + 3 seconds (second runner) + 3 seconds (third runner) + 3 seconds (fourth runner) = 69 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* 55 seconds (each runner) * 4 runners = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 220 seconds - 69 seconds = 151 seconds.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used and the number of rats. 

* **Straw distribution:** We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total.
* **Hamster straw usage:** 10 cages of hamsters used 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rat straw usage:** 160 - 50 = 110 pieces of straw were used for rats.

To find the number of rats, we can use the following formula:

* **Number of rats = Straw used for rats / Pieces of straw per rat**

* **Number of rats = 110 / 6 = 18.33**

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for the unknown number of chickens.  Let's break it down:

* **Eggs per day:**  We know the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Red chickens:**  The problem states that there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve for the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.
   * We know: r + w = total chickens
   * We know: 3r + 5w = total eggs

2. **Express 'r' in terms of 'w':**
   * The problem states that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write: r = w + 2

3. **Substitute 'r' into the first equation:**
   * Substitute (w + 2) for 'r' in the equation: 3(w + 2) + 5w = total eggs

4. **Solve for 'w':**
   * Expand the equation: 3w + 6 + 5w = total eggs
   * Combine like terms: 8w + 6 = total eggs
   * Solve for 'w': 8w = total eggs - 6
   * Since we know the total eggs, we can substitute the value of 'total eggs' into the equation.

5. **Solve for 'r':**
   * Substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation r = w + 2 to find the number of red chickens.

**Important Note:**  The problem statement is not entirely clear.  It's possible there is an error in the number of eggs collected or the number of chickens.

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use the information given. 

* **Day 1:** Sloane counted 100 customers.
* **Day 2:** She counted 50 more customers than Day 1, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
* **Total for the first two days:** 100 + 150 = 250 customers.
* **Day 3:**  The total number of customers for the three days is 500.  Therefore, Sloane counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.

"The problem presents a scenario with a logical inconsistency.  Let's break down why:

* **Water Loss:**  The problem states the pools are emptying at 4 gallons per minute.  This means the rate of water loss is constant.
* **Initial Water Levels:**  The problem states the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This implies the initial water levels were different. 
* **The Problem:** The problem then states the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This is a contradiction.

**Therefore, the problem is flawed and cannot be solved as presented.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, the average age of the three in three years is (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To determine the probability of a randomly picked card being a water type, we need to consider the current number of water type Pokemon and the total number of Pokemon. 

* James has 32 water type Pokemon remaining after losing 8.
* He started with 40 water type Pokemon.
* The total number of Pokemon is 30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90.

Therefore, the probability of picking a water type card is:

Probability = (Number of water type Pokemon) / (Total number of Pokemon) = 32 / 90 

This simplifies to approximately 0.356.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is **36%**.

"The redwood's weight is determined by the volume of wood it contains.  A 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.  Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, we can calculate the total weight as follows:

* **Total weight = (Height in feet) * (Weight per section) * (Number of sections)**

Therefore, the total weight of the redwood is: 200 feet * 10 feet/section * 400 pounds/section = 80,000 pounds.

Now, to account for termite damage, we need to determine the weight of the wood eaten.  Termites consume approximately 30% of the wood.  

* **Weight of wood eaten = (Weight of the redwood) * (Percentage of wood eaten)**

Therefore, the weight of the wood eaten by termites is: 80,000 pounds * 0.30 = 24,000 pounds.

Finally, the remaining weight of the redwood is: 80,000 pounds - 24,000 pounds = 56,000 pounds.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business suits, suitcases, and a flight ticket.  

Let's analyze the expenses:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight Ticket:**  The flight ticket cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit.  This means the flight ticket cost is $5 * $100 + $700 = $570.

**Total Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $570 = $1320

**Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $1320 = $4680

**Gift Budget:**  Theo has $4680 remaining after covering his travel expenses.  To determine how much he can spend on gifts, we need to consider his savings goal of $2000.

**Final Answer:** $4680 - $2000 = $2680

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total number of players is 105.
* The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, meaning we can represent the number of players on the defense as 'x'.
* The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so we can represent the number of players on special teams as 'x/2'.

Now, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation:

(7/2)x = 105

Multiplying both sides by (2/7) gives us:

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires in a neighborhood is typically expressed as 1:3. This means for every one pole, you need three wires to connect the electricity.  

To determine the number of poles required, we can use the following logic:

* **Total wires:** 45
* **Ratio:** 1:3
* **Calculation:**  We need to find the number of units of wires for which the ratio is 1:3.  
   * 45 wires / 3 = 15 units of wires.
* **Poles:** Since the ratio is 1:3, for each unit of wire, we need 3 poles.
   * 15 units * 3 poles/unit = 45 poles.

**Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 45.**

"To determine the number of boxes needed, we need to consider the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 

Jam has 24 pencils in her boxes, and Meg has 46 pencils.  

To find the total number of pencils, we add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has: 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

Now, we need to determine the number of boxes needed to store 70 pencils.  

Since each box can hold 12 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 70 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 5.83 boxes.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jam and Meg need **6** boxes to store all their pencils.

"The coffee's strength is affected by the cooling process and the addition of cream.  

* **Cooling effect:**  The ice cubes cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
* **Weaker coffee:**  Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
* **Total weakening:** 65 degrees * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters
* **Adding cream:** The cream adds 15 milliliters of weakening.
* **Final weakening:** 780 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 795 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is **795 milliliters** weaker.

The problem states that 5 people trade records.  We know that each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.  We also know that they leave with 7 new records.  

To find the number of old records brought in, we can use the following equation:

* **Total new records = 5 people * (2 old records per new record)**

We know the total new records are 7.  Let's solve for the number of old records brought in:

* **7 = 5 * (2 old records per new record)**
* **7 = 10 old records**

**Therefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records.**

"Job B offers a higher net pay compared to Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:**
    * Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
    * Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
    * Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
* The size of the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.
* The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving for 'x', we get:
* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = **60**.

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms:
* 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):
* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Total legs: 80 + 80 = 160

Therefore, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  We need to know how many friends she's inviting. Let's call this 'x'. The cost of mini-golf for 'x' friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:**  She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the cost for 'x' friends is 10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of mini-golf and go-karts to see if it's within her budget:

5x + 20 = 90

To find the number of friends, we need to solve this equation. 

**Solving for x:**

* 5x = 90 - 20
* 5x = 70
* x = 70 / 5
* x = 14

**Answer:** Morgan can invite **14** friends.

* **Gumball Cost:** Billy spent $0.20 on gumballs.
* **Candy Pounds:**  We can calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing his remaining money by the price per pound. $8.50 / $1.50 per pound = 5.67 pounds. 

**Therefore, Billy bought approximately 5.67 pounds of candy.**

* **Cost:** Millie's initial investment of $18 covers the cost of supplies for 36 cups of lemonade.
* **Revenue:** She sells 144 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup, generating $144 in revenue.
* **Profit:**  Her profit is calculated as revenue minus cost, resulting in $144 - $18 = $126 per hour.

Therefore, Millie can expect to make a profit of $126 per hour. 


**Answer:** $126

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To find the original amount of land he had, we can use the following proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the original amount of land.
*  He sold (3/5)x hectares.
*  The remaining land is represented by (2/5)x.
*  We know (2/5)x = 12.8 hectares.

Solving for x:

* Multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32 hectares.

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 32 hectares of land.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a total of 165 popsicles.  To determine the difference in popsicles between them, we can find the value of one ratio part. 

The total ratio parts are 5 + 6 = 11.  Therefore, one ratio part represents 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

The difference in popsicles between Sam and Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel can save a significant amount of energy by reducing his AC usage.  Here's how to calculate the savings:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:** The AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours daily, resulting in 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours of energy consumption per day.
* **Reduced Usage:**  He reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, meaning he uses it for 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours daily.  This translates to 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours of energy consumption per day.
* **Energy Savings:**  The difference in energy consumption is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours per day.
* **Total Savings in 30 Days:** Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-Hour Conversion:**  1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours. Therefore, the total energy saved in kWh is 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = **135 kWh**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Allan has 40 cannolis.
* He buys 60 more, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
* Since he has twice as much corn as cannolis, he has 100 * 2 = 200 corn.
* The total number of corn and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

Therefore, the combined total is 300.

"Let's break down Elliott's steps:

* **School Commute:**  He walked half his total steps to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
* **Short Walk:** He then took 1,000 steps on his walk with his friend.
* **Remaining Steps:** After his walk with his friend, he had 2,000 steps left.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took to and from school and his short walk from the total steps he had left: 2,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 = -4,000. 

This result doesn't make sense. It means Elliott didn't take 2,000 steps during his jog.

"The question presents a classic probability problem.  We need to determine the number of candles that are both defective and explode. 

Here's how we can approach this:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  The problem states that 5% of the candles are defective and have a wet dog smell. This means that the candles that are defective are a subset of the total number of candles. 
* **Key Information:** We are given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This is crucial as it helps us isolate the defective candles that are also likely to explode.

**To find the number of candles that are both defective and explode, we need to consider the following:**

* **The probability of a candle being defective and exploding:**  We need to know the probability of a candle being defective and exploding. This is a conditional probability. 

**To solve this, we need to consider the following:**

* **The probability of a candle being defective:** 5% of the candles are defective.
* **The probability of a defective candle exploding:** This is a separate probability that needs to be determined. 

**Therefore, we need more information to solve this problem.**

* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples.

"The problem presents a classic case of a system of equations to solve for the number of camels and dromedaries.  

Let's break it down:

* **Heads:**  The total number of heads is 180.
* **Bumps:** The total number of bumps is 304.

We know that camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one.  

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We can set up the following equations:

* **Equation 1:** c + d = 180  (The total number of heads)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps)

To solve for 'd', we can use a method called substitution.  

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"The cost of the soup is calculated as follows:

* The bagel cost $4.
* The soup is 25% more than the bagel, which means it costs 1.25 times the price of the bagel.
* Therefore, the soup costs $4 * 1.25 = $5.

"Kenny needs to sell enough Pokemon cards to cover the $100 amusement park ticket.  We can represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.  

To find the number of cards he needs to sell, we can set up an equation:

1.5x = $100

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = $100 / 1.5 
x = 66.67

Since we need a whole number of cards, we round this value to the nearest whole number.  

Therefore, Kenny started with approximately **67** cards.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slain **30** dragons.

"The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees from the oven's heating.  After the window is opened, the temperature decreases by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes.  To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after the oven has been on for 3 hours. 

The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.  The temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, so the temperature increases by 5 degrees/hour * 180 minutes = 900 degrees.

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 30/10 = 3 degrees.

The final temperature is 40 + 900 - 3 = 937 degrees.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36

$7 = 2 * Price per pack

Price per pack = $7 / 2 = $3.50

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.50.

"Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives.  To find out how much Jeff gets, we need to solve for the value of 'x' which represents the amount Brad receives. 

We know that the total amount is $100, so we can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

Since Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives, we can calculate his share:

Jeff's share = 4 * x = 4 * 20 = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives **$80**.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar has a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  

*  The number of red jelly beans is 99% of the blue jelly beans, which we can represent as 0.99b.
*  The number of green jelly beans is 101% of the blue jelly beans, which we can represent as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

To find the value of 'b', we divide both sides by 2.99:

b = 1500

Now, let's calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 

To calculate the remaining amount George needs to pay, we subtract his deposit from the total cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900.

"Jim has a 20-pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s). To convert this to megabits per second (Mb/s), we need to know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb).

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (The total number of heads is 20)

We can solve for 's' using either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we can use a simple proportion.  

Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion:

*  6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

*  6x = 36 * 96
*  6x = 3456
*  x = 3456 / 6
*  x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

"The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which means the length increased by half of the original length.  

Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.  The extended length is then 1.50x.  We know the final length is 140cm.  

We can set up an equation: 1.50x = 140cm

Solving for x:
x = 140cm / 1.50 
x = 93.33cm

Therefore, the original length of the dress was approximately 93.33cm.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.  This means we can represent the ages of the twin and triplet as:

*  Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
*  Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

The combined ages are 44, so we can set up an equation:

t + 3t = 44

Simplifying the equation:

4t = 44

To find the age of the twin, we divide both sides by 4:

t = 11

Therefore, one of the twins is **11 years old**.

"The price of the crate of fruit can be determined by considering the cost of each fruit type. 

* **Apples:**  Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  Each banana costs twice the price of an apple, so it costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Each orange costs three times the price of a banana, so it costs $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we need to sum the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

* Chocolate ice cream production rate: 50 quarts per hour
* Vanilla ice cream production rate: 12.5 quarts per hour

To calculate the total quarts produced in 48 hours, we need to consider the production rate for both types of ice cream.

* Total chocolate ice cream production: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
* Total vanilla ice cream production: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 500 quarts
* Total production: 2400 quarts + 500 quarts = 2900 quarts

Therefore, the factory would produce a total of **2900** quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  

To find the length of Bobby's shoe, we need to solve for 'x'.  

* Let's represent Bobby's shoe length as 'x'.

"To determine the initial amount of tea, we need to consider the tea remaining after the consumption.  

We know that 10 quarts of tea were left after 4 students drank 6 quarts and 16 students drank 32 quarts.  

Therefore, the total tea consumed was 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

To find the initial amount, we can use the following equation:

Initial Tea = Remaining Tea + Tea Consumed

Initial Tea = 10 quarts + 38 quarts = 48 quarts.

"The number of students on campus doubles each month, so we can calculate the total number of students by multiplying the number at the beginning of the month by 2 for each month. 

* January: 10 students * 2 = 20 students
* February: 20 students * 2 = 40 students
* March: 40 students * 2 = 80 students
* April: 80 students * 2 = 160 students
* May: 160 students * 2 = 320 students

Therefore, the total number of students added is 320 - 10 = **310** students.

"Felix is charging a per-branch fee, which is a standard practice for tree climbing services.  To determine the average number of branches climbed per day, we need to consider the total number of branches climbed and the number of days he worked. 

Felix made $105 in earnings, and each branch costs $0.25.  To find the total number of branches climbed, we can divide his earnings by the cost per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days: 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day.

"The arcade charges $0.25 per game.  To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of games played and then multiply that by the cost per game.

* **Calculate the total time played:**
    * Jack: 240 minutes
    * Friend 1: 120 minutes
    * Friend 2: 60 minutes
    * Friend 3: 360 minutes
    * Total: 240 + 120 + 60 + 360 = 780 minutes

* **Calculate the number of games played:**
    * Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
    * Total games: 12 games

* **Calculate the total cost:**
    * Total cost: 12 games * $0.25/game = $3.00

"Let's break down the problem:

We know Tanya's salt scrub recipe uses a 10-ounce jar.  To figure out the amount of oil she uses, we need to consider the ratios of each ingredient. 

* **Zest and Fragrance:**  The amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
* **Salt and Sugar:** The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.
* **Oil and Salt:** The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.

Let's use variables to represent the amounts:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
*  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
*  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
*  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

We can express the relationships as follows:

*  x = fragrance
*  y = 2x 
*  o = 2y
*  y = z
*  o = 10 ounces

To find the amount of oil (o), we can use the relationship between oil and salt:

*  o = 2y 
*  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y: o = 2z

Since we know the amount of salt (y) is equal to the amount of sugar (z), we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil:

*  o = 2z

We can now use the information about the total amount of the mixture to find the amount of oil (o).

"Let's analyze the card distribution.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    *  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Total cards:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical pattern.  Let's break it down:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars (half of Week 1)
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars (three times Week 1)

To find the production for Week 4, we need to consider the total production over the first three weeks.  

* **Total Production (Weeks 1-3):** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find the production for Week 4, we subtract the total production from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"The installation cost for Angela's project is calculated as follows:

* **Mirrors:**  Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

"Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, who in turn has saved $10.00 more than Eva.  Eva saved $20.00.  To determine Roy's savings, we can break down the relationship:

* **Eva's savings:** Eva saved $20.00.
* **Anthony's savings:** Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, meaning he saved 1.40 times Anthony's amount.  Therefore, Roy saved 1.40 * $30.00 = $42.00.

**Answer:** Roy has $42.00.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We can determine this by understanding the relationship between the individuals' lifting abilities and the mountain's height.

* **Pompei:**  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
* **Saskay:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, meaning she can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert Naruto's lifting capacity to feet, we divide his lifting capacity in inches by 12 inches per foot. 

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain **40 feet**.

"The time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance as three kangaroos is directly related to the speed of the turtles.  

Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can use the following relationship:

* **Time = Distance / Speed**

Let's break it down:

* **Distance:** Remains the same for both scenarios.
* **Speed:**  The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is represented by (x/2).

Therefore, the time taken by four turtles is:

* **Time = Distance / (x/2)**

Simplifying the equation:

* **Time = 2 * Distance / x**

We know that the distance is 18x (from the original scenario). Substituting this:

* **Time = 2 * 18x / x**

"Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.  

Here's how to calculate that:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + rt) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the relationship between the ages of the siblings:
    *  The person's age is 3 years younger than their brother.
    *  The person is 2 years older than their sister.

* We can represent this with variables:
    * Let the person's age be represented by 'x'
    * Their brother's age is 'x + 3'
    * Their sister's age is 'x - 2'

*  The problem states that the sum of their ages is 87.  This can be written as an equation:
    * x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

*  Solving the equation:
    * 3x + 1 = 87
    * 3x = 86
    * x = 28

* Therefore, the person's age is 28.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down using a system of equations. 

Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.  We know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books.  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, meaning she has F - 12 + 25 books.

The total number of books is the sum of these three: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F:
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the cost of the chickens Isaias bought, we need to consider the profit he aims to make and the selling price per chicken. 

* **Profit:** Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** He plans to sell each chicken for $50.
* **Number of Chickens:** He has 300 chickens in total.

To calculate the cost, we can use the following formula:

**Total Cost = (Selling Price per Chicken * Number of Chickens) - Profit**

Let's plug in the values:

**Total Cost = ($50 * 300) - $2000**

**Total Cost = $15000 - $2000**

**Total Cost = $13000**

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $13000.

"The problem states that Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade and the boys sold an equal number.  To find the number of glasses Micah sold, we can subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total number of glasses sold: 32 - 14 = 18.  Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can conclude that Micah sold 18 glasses.  To find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales: 14 - 18 = -4.  Therefore, Julie sold 4 fewer glasses than Micah.

"Let's break down the problem.  

Sarah's selling rope for $2 per meter.  To find out how much money she'll have left after buying a new rope, we need to consider the cost of the new rope. 

The new rope costs $1.50 per meter.  To find out how much money she'll have left, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and then subtract that from the money she made from selling the old rope. 

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Cost of the new rope:**  $1.50/meter * x meters 
* **Money left:** $40 - ($1.50/meter * x meters) 

Where 'x' is the number of meters of the new rope Sarah buys.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know Melanie's age in 10 years will be 18.  This means her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

To find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age, we need to find the value of 'x' in the equation: 8 + x = 3 * 8.

Solving for 'x', we get:
8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"Elaina's final concert was extended to a duration of 65 minutes, which is twice the length of her usual concerts.  To determine the length of her usual concerts, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the length of her usual concert.
*  The final concert is twice the length of her usual concert, so: 2 * x = 65 minutes
*  Solving for 'x', we get: x = 65 minutes / 2 = 32.5 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for **32.5 minutes**.

"The singer has 50 microphones, and we need to determine the number of pairs that can be arranged.  

To do this, we need to consider the number of microphones that won't fit.  Since 20% of the microphones won't find a place, we can calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs. 

* **Total microphones:** 50
* **Micrometers that won't fit:** 50 * 0.20 = 10
* **Micrometers that can be arranged in pairs:** 50 - 10 = 40

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We need to find Peter's age.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
    * Let Paul's age be represented by ""P + 10"" (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by ""J""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information and apply algebraic reasoning. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:

(D + 10) + A + D + B = 45

Simplifying the equation:

2D + A + 10 + B = 45

Substituting B = A + 20:

2D + A + 10 + (A + 20) = 45

Combining like terms:

2D + 2A + 30 = 45

Solving for A:

2A = 15 - 2D

A = (15 - 2D) / 2

We can now substitute this value of A back into the equation B = A + 20:

B = ((15 - 2D) / 2) + 20

We need to find the value of D.  We know that the total points are 45, so:

D + A + B = 45

Substituting the values of B and A:

D + ((15 - 2D) / 2) + ((15 - 2D) / 2) + 20 = 45

Simplifying the equation:

D + (15 - 2D) + (15 - 2D) + 20 = 45

Combining like terms:

D + 40 - 4D = 45

Solving for D:

-3D = 5

D = -5/3

Since we cannot have a negative score, we need to re-evaluate our approach.  The given information is inconsistent. 



 
**Therefore, we cannot determine Azibo's score based on the provided information.**

"Let's break down the problem. We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch all the Pokemon.  We're given that they have a total of 339 Pokemon.  

To find out how many Pokemon Stan caught, we need to use a system of equations. 

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    *  We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    *  Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    *  Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    *  Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    *  Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    *  Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    *  Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    *  Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:**  We need to find the proportion of the watermelon that each adult gets relative to the total watermelon.  Since each adult gets twice the slice size of a child, we can express this as a ratio. 
* **Setting up the Equation:**  Let 'x' represent the size of a child's slice.  The adult's slice is then 2x.  The total slices are 6.  We can express this as a proportion: 
   (2x / 6) = (x / 3) 
* **Solving for x:**  Simplifying the equation, we get: 
   (2/6) * x = (1/3) * x
   (1/3) * x = (1/3) * x
   This equation tells us that the proportion of the watermelon each adult gets is equal to the proportion of the watermelon each child gets. 


**Therefore, each adult gets 1/3 of the watermelon.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the time it takes to recoup the loan and lost income, we need to consider the total amount needed to be earned. 

The total amount needed is the sum of the loan payments and the lost income: $200,000 (loan payments) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

Given that Jim's degree increases his annual income to $75,000, we can calculate the time to reach the target amount:

$300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim **4 years** to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income.

"Let's analyze the problem.  We know Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls across all three sets.  

* **Second set:**  We know he retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

* **First set:**  To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we can use the information about the relationship between the sets.  

* **Third set:**  He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved 6 / 2 = 3 balls in the third set.

* **Total:**  The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: 6 + (6 + 4) + 3 = 19. 

* **First set:**  Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the first set.

"The car's value depreciates by 21% each year.  To find the price in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"James's insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  The normal monthly premium is $120.  To calculate his annual premium, we need to consider the increased cost.

The increased cost is 60% of the normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his new monthly premium is $120 + $72 = $192.

His annual premium is $192 * 12 = $2304.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.
* Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.

To find the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the time Donovan spent on the meal.
*  Betsy's portion took 'x + 18' minutes.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Solving for 'x':

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

This means Donovan took 40 minutes to prepare the meal.

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Harry has.

Since Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, we can represent this as:

* Harry's fencing = Sam's fencing + 60 feet

We can set up an equation to represent this:

* Sam's fencing + (Sam's fencing + 60) = 100

Simplifying the equation:

* 2 * Sam's fencing + 60 = 100

Solving for Sam's fencing:

* 2 * Sam's fencing = 40
* Sam's fencing = 20 feet

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we can subtract Harry's fencing from the total fencing:

* 100 - 20 = 80 feet

**Answer:** 80 feet

"Let's break down Lauren's retirement savings plan. 

Here's how we can figure out how many more years she needs to work:

* **Annual Savings:** Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.
* **Annual Living Expenses:** She plans to live on 40% of her salary, which is $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.
* **Annual Savings After Expenses:**  Her annual savings are $20,000, and she will spend $40,000 on living expenses, leaving her with $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.
* **Total Savings Needed:** To reach her retirement goal, she needs to save $1,200,000 over 20 years.

**To calculate how many years she needs to work, we can use the following formula:**

Total Savings Needed / Annual Savings = Years to Work

$1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years

**Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to reach her retirement goal.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 2x eggs.
* Camden and Sarah painted a total of 2y + 12 eggs.
* We can express this as a system of equations:
    * 2x + 2y = 56 
    * y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12

Solving for y in the second equation:
* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

Now, we can substitute this value of y back into the first equation:
* 2x + 2(22 - x) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x = 56
* 44 = 56

This equation is not true, which means there is an inconsistency in the given information.  

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as stated.**

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound.

* **Sidewalk Walking:**  She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at twice the speed of the beach, so she walks 1 mile / 1.5 miles per hour = 0.67 hours.

**Total Time:**  The total time for the entire walk is 40 minutes = 40/60 = 2/3 hours.

**Therefore, the total time for the entire 3-mile walk is 2/3 hours, which is equal to 40 minutes.**

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this mathematically as:

*  Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  This can be represented as:

* Blue rope length = Yellow rope length - 7

We can now express the total length of the three ropes as:

* Yellow rope length + Blue rope length + Red rope length = 37

Substituting the expressions for the lengths of the ropes, we get:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 35 = 37

Solving for x:

* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Therefore, the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use the expression:

* Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

Substituting the value of the blue rope length:

* Red rope length = 4 * (12 - 7) 
* Red rope length = 4 * 5
* Red rope length = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"The mural is divided into three equal sections, with each section containing red, white, and purple paint.  Since half the mural is yellow, we can calculate the amount of each color by dividing the total amount of paint by 4.  

The total amount of paint is 12 pints, and each color represents 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.  

The yellow paint represents 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.  

To find the amount of red paint, we can use the fact that the red, white, and purple paint are equal.  Therefore, the red paint represents 6 pints * 3 pints/color = 18 pints.

"The teacher needs to recycle the chalk after using 2 inches of chalk.  To figure out how many days he has left, we need to consider the amount of chalk he uses each day. 

* **Calculate the chalk used on Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the chalk, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.
* **Calculate the chalk remaining:** Since he used 2.25 times the amount of chalk, he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk he normally uses left.
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He has 0.44 times the amount of chalk left, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day.

"The jelly bean jar's volume is calculated as 540 cubic inches.  To determine the number of red jelly beans, we need to consider the packing efficiency.  

The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning that 80% of the space within the jar is effectively used for the jelly beans.  

The estimated number of red jelly beans is 2880, which is 30% of the total jelly beans.  

To find the actual number of red jelly beans, we can use the following formula:

Actual number of red jelly beans = (Estimated number of red jelly beans) * (Packing efficiency)

Actual number of red jelly beans = (2880) * (0.80) = 2304

The difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the actual number is 2304 - 900 = 1404.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them.
* Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  This can be represented as: 5x - 4
* The total number of ice cubes is 116.

To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can set up an equation:

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his speaking speed and the word count per page. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **John's speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"Igor's error in item count suggests a potential issue with the way he organized the items.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Test Tubes:** Igor gathered 8 test tubes, which is half the requested 16. This indicates a potential error in counting.
* **Petri Dishes:** He gathered 16 Petri dishes, which is the requested number.
* **Beakers:**  The total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.  We can use this information to determine the number of beakers.

**To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to consider the following:**

* **Total Items:** 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 24
* **Items Lost:** 29 (total items) - 24 (items counted) = 5

**Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"Vanessa completed her part of the race in **4 minutes**. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Relative Speeds:**  We know Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, meaning her speed is directly proportional to the distance she covers.
* **Time and Distance Relationship:**  The time taken to complete a distance is inversely proportional to the speed.  
* **Calculation:**  Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 2 miles, we can deduce that Vanessa's speed is twice that of Aaron's.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total number of animals is 20.
* Each animal has either 2 or 4 legs.
* We need to find the number of chickens.

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.  Since each chicken has 2 legs, we can represent the total number of chicken legs as 2c.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70.  The total number of legs for the cows is 4w.  

Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

2c + 4w = 70

We can solve for 'c' by substituting the value of 'w' from the first equation into the second equation. 

**c = 20 - w**

**Substituting this into the second equation:**

2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

**Simplifying and solving for 'w':**

40 - 2w + 4w = 70
2w = 30
w = 15

**Now, we can find 'c':**

c = 20 - w
c = 20 - 15
c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.
