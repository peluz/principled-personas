"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  

Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  To determine the number of gold coins, we need to consider the relationship between the number of silver and gold coins.  

Let's represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is represented by the equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).

Solving for 'x', we get:

110 = 2x + 30
80 = 2x
x = 40

Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  The number of gold coins is then: 40 + 30 = 70. 


**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Dana's speed profile is quite interesting.  Let's break down her travel time and distance.

* **Running:**  She runs at a speed four times faster than her walking speed.  This means her running speed is 6 miles per hour.
* **Walking:**  She walks at a speed that is half her running speed, so her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 2 = 3 miles per hour.
* **Time Breakdown:**  She spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.

**Calculating Total Distance:**

* **Running Distance:**  Distance = Speed * Time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
* **Walking Distance:** Distance = Speed * Time = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

**Total Distance:**  12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

**Therefore, Dana can travel 24 miles in six hours.**

"To determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin, we need to consider the dragon's reach and the gemstone's effect. 

The dragon's fire has a radius of 1000 feet.  Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet, but with the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it 3 times farther. 

Therefore, with the gemstone, the javelin can be thrown 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.

To find the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it, we need to add the javelin's range to the dragon's reach. 

The maximum distance is 1200 feet + 1000 feet = 2200 feet.

"Marcy's pension is a complex calculation.  Here's how to break it down:

* **Years of service:** Marcy has worked for 40 years.
* **Initial Pension:**  She receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.
* **Tiered Pension:** After 20 years, her pension is subject to a tiered structure.  This means she receives 5% of the total pension earned over the first 20 years.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We know his salary now is 1.4 times his salary four years ago. 

To find his current salary, we can use the following equation:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

We can use a similar approach to find Lylah's salary. 

* We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. 
* We can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30. 
* We can then solve for Lylah's salary. 

Let's calculate Lylah's salary four years ago:

Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary now:

Lylah's salary now = $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300


 
**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The hive's population is a classic example of a dynamic system.  To determine the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationship between the queen, the baby bees, and the worker bees.

* **The Queen:** The queen bee is the primary reproductive female in the hive.  She lays all the eggs, and her number is a fundamental factor in the hive's population.
* **The Baby Bees:** Baby bees, or larvae, are the offspring of the queen.  They are in a stage of development where they are nurtured and grow into worker bees.
* **The Worker Bees:** Worker bees are the industrious members of the hive, responsible for tasks like foraging for food, caring for the brood, and maintaining the hive.

The ratio of worker bees to baby bees is a key factor in hive dynamics.  We can express this relationship as:

* **Worker Bees = 2 * Baby Bees**

To determine the number of worker bees, we need to know the number of baby bees.  We can then use the ratio to calculate the number of worker bees. 

**Let's break down the problem:**

1. **The number of queens (q) is a key factor:** The number of queens directly influences the number of baby bees. 
2. **The number of baby bees (b) is directly proportional to the number of queens (q):**  The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

**Therefore, to find the number of worker bees (w), we need to know the number of queens (q).**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'.
*  Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'.

We know:

*  S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
*  S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the first equation to substitute 'S' in the second equation:

*  (2B) + B + 2 = 28

Simplifying the equation:

*  3B + 2 = 28

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

*  3B = 26

Dividing both sides by 3:

*  B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find Seth's age:

*  S = 2 * 8.67
*  S = 17.34 (approximately)

Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.

To find the total time, we need to convert the peeling time to seconds: 90 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5400 seconds.

Therefore, the total time to prepare the potatoes is 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.

* **Cost:** The cost per gallon is $5, consisting of $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. 
* **Profit:** Their profit is $25, which is the difference between their revenue and cost. 

To calculate the cost of lemons, we can use the following equation:

**Cost of lemons = Total cost - Total revenue**

**Cost of lemons = $5 * 2.5 - $25 = $12.50**


Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $12.50 on lemons.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* 60 seconds (first runner) + 3 seconds (second runner) + 3 seconds (third runner) + 3 seconds (fourth runner) = 69 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* 55 seconds (each runner) * 4 runners = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 220 seconds - 69 seconds = 151 seconds.

"After 10 years, Tom's tree population will be affected by both planting and felling.  

* **Planting:** Tom plants 10 trees per year for 10 years, resulting in a total of 100 trees.
* **Felling:** He chops down 2 trees per year for 10 years, resulting in a total of 20 trees felled.
* **Net Growth:**  Tom's tree population grows by 100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees.
* **Mortality:**  30% of the trees are expected to die, which is 80 trees * 0.30 = 24 trees.
* **Final Count:**  Tom's tree population after 10 years is 80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees.

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we need to consider the relationship between the cost of a pen and the combined cost of a pencil and eraser.  

Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by considering the cost of one pen. 

The cost of one pen is $1.50.  Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is:

$1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"Elaine's Pokemon collection is a fascinating study in growth!  Let's break down her collection over the three months:

* **Month 1:** She begins with 20 cards and adds 3 times that amount, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She then collects 20 fewer cards than in Month 1, so she acquires 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 3:**  In the third month, she doubles the total from the first two months, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  She then adds another 200 cards to her collection.

Therefore, her total collection after three months is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = **320** cards.

"The problem presents a classic scenario of a chicken coop with a discrepancy in egg production.  Let's break it down:

* **Egg Production:**  The key is to understand the relationship between the number of red and white chickens and the total number of eggs collected. 
* **The Discrepancy:** The problem states that Jerry collects 42 eggs, and we know the red and white chickens produce a total of 42 eggs. 
* **The Solution:**  To find the number of red chickens, we need to consider the number of white chickens. 

**Therefore, the number of red chickens is directly related to the number of white chickens.  **

"The problem presents a logical inconsistency.  The scenario describes a situation where the water levels in the pools are changing, but the rate of water loss is constant.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Conditions:**  The problem states that the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This implies that the initial water levels were not equal. 
* **Water Loss:** The problem states that both pools lose 4 gallons per minute. This is a constant rate of water loss.

**The Problem:** The problem states that the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This is a contradiction. 

**Conclusion:**  The problem is not logically sound.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the fact that their ages will change over time. 

* **Harriet's Age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's Age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's Age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

**Calculating the Average Age in Three Years:**

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Harriet's Age in Three Years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Adrian's Age in Three Years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Zack's Age in Three Years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, we calculate the average age: (24 + 66 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To determine the number of cherry tomato vines Steve needs, we need to consider his daily consumption and the yield per vine. 

He consumes 6 tomatoes per day, and each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.  

To calculate the total tomatoes needed, we multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

To determine the number of vines required, we divide the total tomatoes needed by the yield per vine: 42 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs **14** vines.

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving a simple linear relationship between the number of snails and fish.  

Let's break it down:

* **Snails:** The difference in snails between the two aquariums is directly proportional to the number of fish.  
* **Fish:**  We are given that the number of fish in both aquariums is equal.

To find the number of fish in each aquarium, we can use the following equation:

* **Difference in snails = 2 * (Number of fish)**

Let's solve for the number of fish:

* **32 - 4 = 2 * x**
* **28 = 2 * x**
* **x = 14**

Therefore, each aquarium has **14** fish.

* **The total trade:**  We know 5 people traded records, and they left with 7 new records. 

To find the number of old records brought in, we need to consider the trade ratio and the number of new records obtained. 

**The key is to understand that the ratio of old records to new records is fixed at 2:1.  Therefore, we can use this ratio to find the number of old records brought in.**

"The initial passenger count at the terminal is the key to solving this problem.  We know that 20 people are traveling to the third stop.  

Let's break down the passenger changes:

* **First Stop:** 5 more passengers boarded the bus.
* **Second Stop:** 7 passengers disembarked, and 8 more boarded.

To find the initial passenger count, we need to consider the passengers at the second stop. 

* **Second Stop:** 20 people (at the third stop) - 7 people (got off) + 8 people (got on) = 11 people

* **First Stop:** 11 people (at the second stop) - 5 people (got on) = 6 people

**Answer:** 6 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"To fully charge the phone, it will take approximately **2 hours**. 

Here's why:

* The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.
* To reach 100% charge, the phone needs to gain 40% of charge (100% - 60% = 40%).
*  This 40% charge gain requires 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.
*  Converting 120 minutes to hours, we get 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.
* The smallest group has x - 10 students.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in the equal groups and the smallest group: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

Solving for x:
2x + x - 10 = 200
3x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = **60** students.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  We need to know how many friends she's inviting. Let's call this number ""x"". The cost of mini-golf for all her friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:**  She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is 10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of mini-golf and go-karts to see if it's within her budget:

5x + 20 = 90

To find the number of friends, we need to solve this equation. 

**Answer:** 
* **Option A:** 16 
* **Option B:** 12 
* **Option C:** 8 
* **Option D:** 14

* **Change:** Billy had $10.00 and spent a portion of this on candy. 
* **Gumballs:** Billy spent $0.20 on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.

**Let's break down the calculation:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the candy:**
   *  We need to find the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased.

2. **Calculate the amount of change Billy has left:**
   *  We know Billy has $9.80 left after buying gumballs.

"The train's service interval is based on the total distance traveled.  To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a day and then divide that by the service interval.

The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it makes 3 trips per day.  Therefore, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles.

The train requires service every 18,000 miles.  To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the service interval: 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.3875 services per day.

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of the two previous types.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

To calculate the total stuffing for the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Outbound Trip:**

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To determine his initial land holdings, we can use the following proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.

*  He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.

*  The remaining land is represented by (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8 hectares.

*  Simplifying the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

*  Solving for x: 
    * Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
    * Calculate: x = 32 hectares.

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 32 hectares of land.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a total of 165 popsicles.  To determine the difference in popsicles between them, we can calculate the value of one ratio part. 

The total popsicles are divided into 11 parts, with 5 representing Betty's share and 6 representing Sam's share.  Therefore, one ratio part represents 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, so she possesses 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.  Sam, on the other hand, has 6 parts, resulting in 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

The difference in popsicles between Sam and Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel's energy consumption is a prime example of how to optimize energy usage.  

To calculate the energy savings, we need to consider the power consumption of the air conditioner and the reduction in usage time. 

* **Power Consumption:** The AC uses 900 watts of power per hour.
* **Reduced Usage:** Mel reduces his AC usage by 5 hours per day.

**Calculating Daily Savings:**

* **Original Daily Consumption:** 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours
* **Reduced Daily Consumption:** 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours
* **Daily Savings:** 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

**Converting to Kilowatt-hours:**

* 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours
* **Total Savings in kWh:** 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

**Therefore, Mel will save 4.5 kilowatt-hours of energy in 30 days.**

* **Meat:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
* **Cheese:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00 on meat.

The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00 on cheese.

The total cost for the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

* **Understanding the Problem:**  The key here is to recognize that the problem is a combination of two separate events.  We know that 5% of the candles are defective, and we are interested in the candles that are both defective and explode. 

* **Applying the Logic:**  The question states that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that the remaining 1% are the ones that are defective and explode. 

* **Calculating the Number:**  To find the number of candles that are both defective and explode, we need to consider the percentage of defective candles that are also defective and explode.

"Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathered twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne.  This means her sister gathered 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.  

The total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 30 + 60 + x = 500, where x is the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.  

To find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we can solve for x: 30 + 60 + x = 500.  

Combining like terms, we get 90 + x = 500.  Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get x = 410.

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can utilize the relationship between the number of camels and dromedaries and the total number of heads and bumps. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know the following:

* **Heads:** c + d = 180
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' in the first equation:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost-equivalent, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other. 

Let's analyze the cost breakdown for each venue:

**Venue 1:**

* Fixed cost: $200 (flat fee)
* Variable cost: $5 per guest (food)
* Total cost: $200 + $5 * number of guests

**Venue 2:**

* Fixed cost: $0 (no fixed fee)
* Variable cost: $25 per guest (food included)
* Total cost: $25 * number of guests

Setting the two cost equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

Now, we can solve for the number of guests that make the costs equal. 

**Solving for the number of guests:**

* $200 + $5 * x = $25 * x
* $200 = $20 * x
* x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are required for the two venues to have the same cost.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

Let's use the following variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36

Multiplying both sides by 2: 5x = 72

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects: (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found **14.2** insects.

"The problem states that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's break down the relationship between the different colors of jelly beans.

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  The number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:** The number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 1.01b.

To find the number of jelly beans in the jar, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:

Difference = 1515 - 1495 = 20

**Answer:** The jar contains 20 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago.  We can express this relationship as:

*  Current age = 2 * (Age five years ago)

To find Jerry's age in three years, we need to consider his current age and add three years. 

*  Age in three years = Current age + 3

Let's solve for the current age:

*  Age in three years = 2 * (Age five years ago) + 3

To find the age five years ago, we can use the current age:

*  Age five years ago = Current age / 2

Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation for age in three years:

*  Age in three years = 2 * (Current age / 2) + 3

Simplifying the equation:

*  Age in three years = Current age + 3

We know that the current age is 10.  Therefore:

*  Age in three years = 10 + 3 = 13

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 

To calculate the remaining amount George needs to pay, we subtract his deposit from the total cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900.

To figure out how many hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours. 


**Answer:**  George needs to work 126.67 hours.

"The angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the total chocolate pounds produced by Ruiz and Marissa, we need to consider their individual production rates and the total work hours. 

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz produces 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, which translates to a production rate of 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's production:** Marissa produces 3/4 times Ruiz's production, meaning she produces (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

**Total production:**  Over 12 hours, Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa produces 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.  

Therefore, the total production for both is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"The tire's lifespan is determined by the number of rotations it undergoes.  To determine the replacement time, we need to calculate the number of rotations required for the given mileage.

* **Total rotations per year:** 125,280,000 
* **Rotations per mile:** 725
* **Miles driven:** 400

**Calculation:**

* Total rotations = (Rotations per mile) * (Miles driven)
* Total rotations = 725 * 400 = 290,000 rotations

**To determine the replacement time, we need to divide the total rotations by the rotations per year:**

* Years to replace tires = Total rotations / Rotations per year
* Years to replace tires = 290,000 / 125,280,000 = 0.023 years

**Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after approximately 0.023 years, or about 8.1 days.**

"To determine the number of days it takes Prince to sell the bull's meat, we need to consider his daily meat production and the bull's weight. 

Prince sells 15 kilograms of meat per hour, and he works 10 hours a day. This means he can sell 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750 kg.  To find out how many days it will take to sell the entire bull's meat, we divide the bull's weight by Prince's daily meat sales: 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

Therefore, it will take Prince **5 days** to sell the entire bull's meat.

"Jim has a 20-piece pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  He chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  
   * Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  
   * This translates to: 4s + 2g = 70 
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.
   * This translates to: s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using these equations. 

**Solving for 's':**

1. **Isolate 'g' in Equation 2:**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to understand the relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns produced.  

The key is to recognize that the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is consistent.  

* **Understanding the Ratio:**  If 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

* **Calculation:**  To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

   * 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

   * Cross-multiplying, we get: 6 * x = 36 * 96

   * Simplifying: 6x = 3456

   * Dividing both sides by 6: x = 576

**Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.**

"The dress was extended by 50% of its original length, which means the length increased by half of the original length.  

To find the original length, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.
*  The extended length is 1.50x.
*  The final length is 140cm.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1.50x + 20cm = 140cm

Solving for x:

1.50x = 140cm - 20cm
1.50x = 120cm
x = 120cm / 1.50
x = 80cm

**Answer:** The dress was 80cm long in its original design.

"The price of the crate of fruit is determined by the cost of each individual fruit.  

* **Apples:**  Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  Each banana costs twice the price of an apple, so it costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Each orange costs three times the price of a banana, so it costs $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we sum the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

The total cost of the crate is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to calculate the total number of TVs sold and then subtract the number of smart and analog TVs. 

The total number of TVs sold is 40. 

* Smart TVs: 40 TVs * (1/4) = 10 TVs
* Analog TVs: 40 TVs * (1/8) = 5 TVs
* Total Smart and Analog TVs: 10 TVs + 5 TVs = 15 TVs

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 40 TVs - 15 TVs = 25 TVs.

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the ratios of the ingredients.  

Let's use the following variables:

* **x:** Amount of zest
* **y:** Amount of salt
* **z:** Amount of sugar
* **o:** Amount of oil

We know the following:

* **x = fragrance** 
* **y = 2x**
* **o = 2y**
* **y = z**
* **10 ounces total**

Since we know the amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, we can substitute x for fragrance.  

We also know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar.  

Therefore, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil:

**o = 2z**

We can then substitute z for y in the equation for oil:

**o = 2z**

We know that Tanya uses 10 ounces of the mixture.  

To find the amount of oil (o), we need to determine the relationship between the amounts of each ingredient.

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to analyze the relationships between the card quantities of the three individuals. 

* **Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.** 
* **Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.**
* **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.**

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341.  We can express this mathematically as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Therefore, PJ has 47 cards.

To find Becca's cards, we substitute the value of x back into the equation for Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who in turn can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can use the following logic:

* **Saskay's lifting capacity:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.
* **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting capacity:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches.  

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Mason travels 32 miles in the first leg of his journey at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours.  He then rests for a short period, and then travels for another 6 hours at the same speed.  

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to consider the time spent on each leg of the journey. 

* **Leg 1:** 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
* **Leg 2:** 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

"The time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance as three kangaroos is directly related to the speed of the turtles.  

Since the turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can determine the time by considering the relationship between the speed and the time. 

* **The turtles' speed is half that of a kangaroo, so their speed is x/2.**
* **The distance traveled is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles.**
* **We can use the formula Time = Distance / Speed to find the time for the turtles.**

Therefore, the time for four turtles to travel the same distance as three kangaroos is 36 hours.

"To determine the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we need to consider their badge earning rates. 

* **Claire:** Earning one badge per month.
* **Amber:** Earning half a badge per month (twice as long as Claire).
* **Wendy:** Earning three times the amount of badges as Claire.

Therefore, Wendy earns three times the number of badges Claire earns in a month. 

To find the difference in badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year, we can calculate the difference in their monthly badge earnings. 

Wendy earns 3 badges per month, and Amber earns 0.5 badges per month. The difference in their monthly badge earnings is 3 - 0.5 = 2.5. 

Over a year, Wendy earns 2.5 badges/month * 12 months = 30 more badges than Amber.

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"To determine Peter's age, we can use a system of equations.  Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, P+10, and J respectively.  

We know that the combined age of all three is 100:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now we can solve for P.  Let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100
2P + 10 + J = 100
2P + J = 90

We can solve for J:

J = 90 - 2P

Now, substitute this value of J into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (90 - 2P)
P = P + 10 + 90 - 2P
P = 100 - P
2P = 100
P = 50

Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Cameron would save 460 pesos. 

Here's why:

* The hotel charges a flat rate for 12 hours, which is 1000 pesos.
* After 12 hours, an additional charge of 70 pesos per hour applies. 
* He stays for 12 hours, so the cost of the additional hours is 70 pesos/hour * 2 hours = 140 pesos.
* The total cost of his stay is 1000 pesos + 140 pesos = 1140 pesos. 
* Therefore, Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1140 pesos = 460 pesos.

"To determine the total hay needed, we must first calculate the hay consumption per sheep.  Each sheep requires 7 pounds of hay, as it needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat requires.  

The total hay needed for the goats is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.  

The total hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

Therefore, the total hay needed is 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to work backward from the total points and the relationship between the scores of Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar. 

Let's break it down:

* **Total Points:** The team scored a total of 45 points.
* **Bahati's Score:** Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.  This means we can express Bahati's score as (A + 20) and (D + 10).
* **Azibo's Score:**  We can express Azibo's score as (D - 10).

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for Azibo's score:

(A + D + B) = 45

Substituting the expressions for A, B, and D:

(D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplifying the equation:

3D + 10 = 45

Solving for D:

3D = 35

D = 11.67 (approximately)

Now, we can find Azibo's score:

A = D - 10

A = 11.67 - 10

A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"James reads 18 pages at a rate of 3 pages per 10 minutes.  To find the total time spent reading, we can use the following calculation:

* **Total time = (Total pages read) / (Pages per 10 minutes)**
* **Total time = 18 pages / 3 pages per 10 minutes = 6 times 10 minutes = 60 minutes**

Therefore, James spends **60 minutes** reading.

"The hotel began with 100 guests.  24 guests checked out early and 15 guests checked out late.  In the afternoon, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, resulting in 30 guests.  Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner.  

To calculate the current number of guests, we need to consider the initial number of guests, the number of early checkouts, the number of late checkouts, and the number of guests who checked in after dinner.

* **Initial guests:** 100
* **Early checkouts:** 24
* **Late checkouts:** 15
* **Afternoon check-ins:** 30
* **Dinner check-ins:** 7

Adding these together, we get 100 + 24 + 15 + 30 + 7 = 176 guests.

"The quiz is structured as follows: 40% of the questions are easy, with the remaining 60% divided equally between average and difficult questions.  

To determine the points Aries is sure to receive, we need to consider the following:

* **Easy questions:** Aries is certain to answer 75% of the easy questions correctly.
* **Average and difficult questions:**  She is guaranteed to answer half of the average and difficult questions correctly.

Let's calculate the points she is sure to earn:

* **Easy questions:** 24 questions * 0.75 points/question = 18 points
* **Average and difficult questions:** 18 questions * 0.5 points/question = 9 points

**Total points:** 18 points + 9 points = 27 points

"Teresa's pricing strategy is a classic example of a markup.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Large Stuffed Animals:**  She sells each large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small stuffed animal.
* **Small Stuffed Animals:**  She sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
* **Earnings:**  Her total earnings are $120.

To find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we need to use the following equation:

* **Total Earnings = (Price per Large Animal) * (Number of Large Animals) + (Price per Small Animal) * (Number of Small Animals)**

Let's plug in the known values:

* $120 = (3 * $4) * x + (4 * 2x)

Simplifying the equation:

* $120 = $12x + 8x
* $120 = 20x
* x = $120 / 20
* x = 6

Therefore, Teresa sold **6** small stuffed animals.

"Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  After a gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst, she had 15 red balloons remaining.  She then released half of her yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.  Finally, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 6 blue balloons to her collection.  

Therefore, Sally carried 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons into school.

"The probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework is 8%. 

Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%

"To determine the time it takes for Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the total amount he needs to earn. 

Jim's degree increases his annual income by a factor of three, meaning he earns $75,000 per year after college.  

His total earnings during his four years of college are $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.

He incurred $200,000 in loan payments over four years.

To calculate the time to recoup his losses, we need to determine how long it takes to earn $300,000. 

The answer is 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years. 


**Answer:** 4 years

"The car's value depreciates by 21% each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

* **Beds per week:** Greg washes 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds.
* **Loads per week:** He can wash 2 sets of twin sheets + 1 king set of sheets = 3 loads per week.
* **Total loads per year:** Greg washes 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads per year.

To calculate his total collection, we need to consider the stickers he had two years ago, the stickers he collected last year, and the stickers he collected this year. 

* Two years ago: 100 stickers

"Let's analyze the time allocation for this culinary collaboration.  

We know that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.  

To determine the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

* **Betsy's portion time = Donovan's portion time + 18 minutes**

Let Donovan's portion time be represented by 'x'.  Therefore, Betsy's portion time is 'x + 18'.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both portions:

* **x + (x + 18) = 98**

Simplifying the equation:

* **2x + 18 = 98**

Solving for 'x':

* **2x = 80**
* **x = 40**

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.  

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The total number of pizzas consumed is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.  The total number of pizzas remaining is 20 - 46 = -26.  This result is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of pizzas.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

"In a standard 24-hour period, a single spring can produce a significant number of jellyfish.  To calculate the total jellyfish produced by five springs in four hours, we need to consider the rate of jellyfish production per hour. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Jellyfish production per hour:**  A single spring produces 216,000 jellyfish in a 24-hour period. 
* **Jellyfish production in four hours:**  To find the jellyfish produced in four hours, we need to multiply the jellyfish production per hour by the number of hours. 

**Therefore, five springs would produce 216,000 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 1,080,000 jellyfish in four hours.**

"The problem presents a classic linear equation.  Let's break it down:

*  We know the total fence length is 100 feet.
*  Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam. 
*  This translates to a linear equation:  x + (x + 60) = 100

Solving for x, we get:

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find the amount left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total: 100 - 20 = 80 feet. 


**Answer:** 80 feet

"The scenario presents a classic example of predator-prey dynamics.  Let's break it down:

* **The T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, indicating the T-Rex had already consumed half of the original meal. 
* **The Velociraptor's Role:** The velociraptors scavenged half of the remaining portion after the T-Rex's consumption. 

To determine the initial weight of the triceratops, we can use the following logic:

* **The T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms, meaning the T-Rex ate half of what was left after the velociraptors. 
* **The Velociraptor's Role:** The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex. 

Therefore, the triceratops had 135 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"The problem states that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color under UV light.  We know that 6 jellyfish changed color.  

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the number of large jellyfish:**  Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we can find the number of large jellyfish by dividing the number of jellyfish that changed color by 1/3. 
2. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish:**  We can then multiply the number of large jellyfish by 5 to find the total number of jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 6 / (1/3) * 5 = 90.

"Let's break down this egg-cellent problem!

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  Since they painted the same number, we can represent that as 'x' eggs.  

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  To find out how many eggs Camden painted, we need to consider that he painted 12 more than Sarah.  

Let's represent Sarah's eggs as 'y'.  We can set up an equation:

*  Camden's eggs (y + 12) = 30 
*  Sarah's eggs (y) = 30 - 12

Now, we can solve for 'y' and 'x'. 

*  y = 30 - 12 = 18
*  x = 56 - (Camden's eggs + Sarah's eggs) = 56 - (18 + 12) = 20

Therefore, Camden painted 23 eggs.  

**Answer:**  Camden painted 23 more eggs than Arnold.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  Therefore:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  To find the length of the red rope, we substitute the value of x back into the equation for the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"The mural's proportions are crucial to understanding the paint usage.  We know that the yellow paint represents half the mural, and the red, white, and purple paints are equal.  Therefore, we can calculate the amount of each color by dividing the total paint by the number of colors. 

The total paint is 12 pints, and there are four colors.  Therefore, each color represents 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.

The yellow paint represents half the mural, so it uses 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.

To find the amount of red paint, we need to consider the fact that the red, white, and purple paints are equal.  The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and the yellow paint represents 6 pints.  Therefore, the red paint represents 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs, we need to consider the number of slices consumed and the number of slices per pizza. 

* **Cheese Pizza:** Kate consumes 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese pizza slices.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** Kate consumes 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni pizza slices.
* **Total Slices:** Kate consumes 36 cheese slices + 24 pepperoni slices = 60 slices.
* **Cheese Pizza Required:** 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 cheese pizzas.
* **Pepperoni Pizza Required:** 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas. 

Since you cannot purchase half a pizza, Kate needs to purchase 5 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, meaning it removes 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removed, we need to consider the duration of each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters** 


Therefore, the total water removed from the basement is 30 liters.

"The problem requires us to determine the error in Tim's estimation of the number of red jelly beans.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the jar.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.  In this case, the dimensions are 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches.  Therefore, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we need to calculate the volume of the jelly beans.  The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning that 80% of the space within the jar is occupied by the jelly beans.  We can calculate the volume of the jelly beans by multiplying the volume of the jar by the packing efficiency.  

The number of jelly beans can be calculated by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.  The volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.  

Finally, we can calculate the difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans.

"The board is 40 feet long, and we need to determine the length of the longer piece.  

Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4x.  The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we have the equation: x + 4x = 40.  Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Carly needs to make enough treats for her class of five students, and each student gets two treats.  Let's represent the number of cupcakes she makes with the variable 'c'.  We know that the number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2.  

We can express this mathematically as:

*  b = 3c - 2

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To determine the number of novels she has written this year, we can use the concept of proportions.  If 3/4 of her novels this year represent the 9 novels she wrote last year, then we can set up a proportion:

(3/4) * x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = (9 * 4) / 3

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 kilometers.  Michael travels at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.  To determine the percentage of the distance he has covered in three days, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in kilometers over three days. 

* **Daily distance:** 50 kilometers per hour * 24 hours per day = 1200 kilometers per day
* **Total distance in three days:** 1200 kilometers per day * 3 days = 3600 kilometers
* **Percentage of distance covered:** 3600 kilometers / 6000 kilometers * 100% = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"Bud's macaroni and cheese expenses can be calculated as follows:

* **Pasta cost:** $1.00 per box, and he makes a weekly batch.
* **Cheddar cheese cost:** $3.00 per week.
* **Gruyere cheese cost:**  Twice the cheddar cost, so $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 per week.
* **Total weekly cheese cost:** $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 per week.
* **Yearly cheese cost:** $9.00 per week * 52 weeks = $468.00 per year.

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 on cheese for his macaroni and cheese each year.

"The custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms in 5 days, which equates to 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes of cleaning time.  

The custodian works an 8-hour day, which is 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.  

To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we divide the cleaning time by the total work time and multiply by 100%:

(1200 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 250%

Therefore, the custodian spends an average of 250% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"The problem states that Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  

To find the number of blueberry cubes, we can use the following equation:

Blueberry cubes = 5 * Strawberry cubes - 4

We can solve for the number of strawberry cubes by using the total number of ice cubes:

Total ice cubes = Strawberry cubes + Blueberry cubes
116 = Strawberry cubes + (5 * Strawberry cubes - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

116 = 6 * Strawberry cubes - 4
120 = 6 * Strawberry cubes
Strawberry cubes = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Blueberry cubes = 5 * 20 - 4
Blueberry cubes = 100 - 4
Blueberry cubes = 96

Therefore, Mary makes **96** blueberry cubes.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his speaking speed and the word count per page. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **John's speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)
* **John's new speed:** 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM
* **Words per page:** 450 words
* **Total words:** 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

**To calculate the time, we use the following formula:**

Time = Total words / Speed

**Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes**

**Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.**

The final 30 seconds of popping represent a decrease in the rate of popping, which is a natural consequence of the kernels reaching their peak temperature and the heat source being reduced.  

The residual heat will continue to pop kernels for a short period of time, but the rate of popping will be significantly reduced. 

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to calculate the total number of kernels popped in each stage of the process. 

* **Stage 1:** 20 kernels
* **Stage 2:** 3 * 20 = 60 kernels
* **Stage 3:** 4 * 60 = 240 kernels
* **Stage 4:** 240 kernels / 2 = 120 kernels
* **Total:** 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels

The residual heat will pop an additional 30 kernels. 

Therefore, Garrett has a total of 440 + 30 = **470** kernels to eat.

"To determine the number of lemons needed for Tim's extra gallon of lemonade, we need to consider the juice yield per lemon.  

* **Lemon juice yield:**  Each lemon yields 1 cup of juice.
* **Total juice needed:** Tim requires 4 gallons of lemonade, which translates to 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of juice.
* **Extra gallon tartness:**  The extra gallon needs to be twice as tart, meaning it requires 4 cups * 2 = 8 cups of juice.
* **Lemons for the extra gallon:**  To achieve 8 cups of juice, we need 8 cups / 1 cup/lemon = 8 lemons.

Therefore, Tim needs 8 lemons for the extra gallon.

"To determine the total dog food consumption for the week, we need to consider the daily food intake of each breed and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

* **German Shepherds:** 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg
* **Bulldogs:** 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg
* **Total weekly consumption:** 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Therefore, the Kennel needs 21 kilograms of dog food for the week.

"The problem presents a classic scenario of a two-leg journey with a known speed and time for each leg.  

To determine the final distance from the house, we need to consider the total distance traveled.  

* **Distance traveled west:** 90 miles
* **Distance traveled east:** 144 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two legs: 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles. 

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles** from his house.

"The boat depreciates at a rate of 30% per year.  

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"The bag contains 232 candies, with 54 red candies.  The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.  The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.  The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  Therefore, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight.  

To calculate this, we need to determine the total weight of the car and its occupants.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and has luggage weighing 250 pounds, totaling 1450 pounds.  The two children weigh a combined 150 pounds.  Therefore, the total weight of everything in the car is 1450 pounds + 150 pounds = 1600 pounds.

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight, which is 0.01 * 1600 pounds = 16 pounds.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

Emma's age = x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"The problem presents a classic animal population scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations.  

**Solving for 'w' in the first equation:**
* w = 20 - c

**Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

**Simplifying and solving for 'c':**
* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
