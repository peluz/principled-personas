"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen.  

Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the following equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:

18x = 162

Solving for x, we find:

x = 162 / 18 = 9

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:

99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can use a simple algebraic equation.  Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is represented as 110.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can calculate the number of gold coins:

Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

"To determine the number of wins, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let 'x' represent the number of games lost.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of wins as 'x + 8'.  The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses, so we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Solving for 'x', we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we find 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, we arrive at x = 7.  Therefore, the team won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.  Since Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald sold, we can express this as 10x.  The total number of copies sold by both individuals is 88,000.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 88,000

Solving for x, we divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold **8,000** copies.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's.  This means Gerald's original time is represented by 'x' seconds.  Lee's time is then 'x + 2' seconds.

We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

Now, we need to calculate Gerald's new time.  We know that Gerald's time improved by 10%.  This means his new time is 1.1 times his original time.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

To find Lylah's salary, we need to consider the relationship between their salaries.  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

* Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30

We can solve for Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30:

* Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later:

* Lylah's salary now = $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

* Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The hive's population dynamics can be analyzed through a bee-centric perspective.  

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is the foundation of the hive's reproductive system.  
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are responsible for the hive's operational efficiency.  
* **Baby Bees:** Baby bees (b) are the future generation of worker bees.

We can express the relationship between these bee types as follows:

* **w = 2b**  (The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees)
* **b = 2q** (The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens)

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2 * (2q) = 4q**

Since we know the number of queens (q) is 100, we can calculate the number of worker bees:

**w = 4 * 100 = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is represented by 'S' and Brooke's age is represented by 'B'.
* We are given that S = 2B, meaning Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* The sum of their ages in two years will be 28.

To find Seth's current age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = 2B, we can substitute this into the equation: 2B + B + 2 = 28
2. **Combine:** Combine the 'B' terms: 3B + 2 = 28
3. **Isolate B:** Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
4. **Solve for B:** Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**


**Final answer: 17.34**

"Zaid's monthly expenses are quite substantial.  He spends 1/4 of his income on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and then donates half of the remaining amount to charity.  This means his spending on these categories is a significant portion of his income.  

Let's break down his expenses:

* **Rent:** 6000$ * (1/4) = 1500$
* **Car Fuel:** 6000$ * (1/3) = 2000$
* **Total Expenses:** 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used with the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:**  The 10 hamster cages each have 5 pieces of straw, totaling 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** The 160 pieces of straw used are distributed among the rodents, with 110 pieces used for the rats. 
* **Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used for rats by the number of pieces of straw each rat receives: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats. 
* **Rat Per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The provided problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to model a real-world situation.  Let's break down the problem and apply a systematic approach to find the solution.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We are given that Jerry has a flock of chickens, and we need to determine the number of red chickens.  The problem provides us with the following information:

* **Egg Production:** Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
* **Total Eggs Collected:** Jerry collects 42 eggs each day.
* **Chicken Ratio:** There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

**Solving the Problem:**

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'.

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of chickens is represented by r + w = total chickens.
* **Equation 2:** The number of red chickens is two more than the number of white chickens, so r = w + 2.

**Solving for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

1. **Substitute:**  We can substitute the second equation (r = w + 2) into the first equation:
   (w + 2) + w = total chickens

2. **Simplify:** Combine like terms:
   2w + 2 = total chickens

3. **Solve for 'w':**  We know the total number of chickens is 42 eggs.  We can use this information to solve for 'w'.

**Final Answer:**

The problem as presented is not solvable.  The number of chickens cannot be a fraction.

"Let's break down this problem using a fluid approach. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're dealing with a classic scenario of water draining from two pools.  The key is to understand the rate of water loss and how it changes the water levels over time.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Rate of Loss:**  The pools are losing 4 gallons per minute.
* **Time:** We're given a time frame of 4 minutes.

**Solving the Problem:**

1. **Initial State:**  We need to determine the initial water levels in each pool. 

2. **Water Loss:**  The pools lose a total of 16 gallons over the 4 minutes.

3. **Current State:**  We need to determine the current water levels in each pool.

**Let's use a visual representation:**

* **Small Pool:**  Let's represent the initial amount of water in the small pool as 'x'.
* **Big Pool:**  The big pool has twice the amount of water as the small pool, so it has 2x gallons.

**Important Note:**  The problem states that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool now. This is a key piece of information.

**Final Answer:**

The problem is flawed.  The information provided is contradictory.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the fact that their ages will increase by the same amount in the future. 

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Zack is half of Harriet's age, so Zack is 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

**Calculating the average age in three years:**

* **Future ages:**
    * Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years old
    * Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old
    * Zack: 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach. 

We know the difference in snail populations is directly related to the number of fish.  This means we can express the difference in snails as a function of the number of fish. 

*  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish: 32 - 4 = 2 * x

We can simplify this equation to: 28 = 2 * x

To find the number of fish, we need to isolate 'x'.  

* Divide both sides by 2: 28 / 2 = x
* This gives us: 14 = x

Therefore, each aquarium has 14 fish.

"To determine the total time, we need to consider the time required for each type of hole and then sum the times. 

* **Small holes:**  Each small hole takes 3 minutes.  We need to dig 30 of them, so the total time is 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
* **Large holes:** Each large hole takes 10 minutes. We need to dig 15 of them, so the total time is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we add the times for both types of holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes. 

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours. 


Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40. 

**Answer:** 40 
"
"Let's analyze the given information:

* **Let Ruby's current age be represented by ""R""**
* **Let Sam's current age be represented by ""S""**

We are given two equations based on the future age of Ruby and Sam:

* **R = 6S**  (This represents the current age relationship between Ruby and Sam)
* **R + 9 = 3(S + 9)** (This represents the future age relationship between Ruby and Sam in 9 years)

To solve for Sam's current age (S), we can use a substitution method:

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since R = 6S, we can substitute this into the second equation:
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

2. **Simplify and solve for S:**
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   3S = 18
   S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use a strategic approach.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Total Players:** The team has 105 members in total.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.  

Since the offense has twice the number of players as the defense, we can express the number of players on the offense as 2x.  

Similarly, the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of players:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Combining like terms:

(5/2)x + x = 105

Simplifying:

(7/2)x = 105

Solving for x:

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x':** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = 60.**

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304

Solving for 'x', we get:

* **x = $100 / 1.5**
* **x = 66.67**

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, Kenny started with approximately **67** cards.

"The perimeter of Billie's room can be determined by applying the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  We can use the area formula to find the width: Area = length * width, so 360 = 9 * width.  Solving for width, we get width = 40 feet.

Now, we can calculate the perimeter: Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet. 

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.

* **Jon's Time:**  Jon completes the swim in 40 minutes, the bike in 70 minutes, and the run in 50 minutes. His total time is 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 minutes.
* **James's Swim:**  James is 10% faster than Jon, so his swim time is 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* **James's Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.
* **James's Run:**  To determine James's run time, we need to consider the fact that Jon won by 10 minutes. This means James's total time is 10 minutes less than Jon's.

3. Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

"To determine the optimal number of guests for a cost-effective surprise party, we need to analyze the cost structure of each venue. 

Let's break down the cost for each option:

**Venue 1:**

* Fixed cost: $200 (flat fee)
* Variable cost: $5 per guest (food)

**Venue 2:**

* Fixed cost: $0 (no additional charge)
* Variable cost: $25 per guest (food included)

To find the point where the costs are equal, we need to set the total cost for each venue equal to each other. 

**Setting up the equation:**

* Venue 1: $200 + $5 * x = $25 * x 
* Venue 2: $0 + $25 * x = $25 * x

**Solving for x:**

* Venue 1: $200 + $5x = $25x
* $200 = $20x
* x = 10

Therefore, for the two venues to be equal in cost, **10 guests** are required.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

Let's use the following variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects:

* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the quantities they purchased.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4x onions.

We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can write the proportion: 
 
 4x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, let's find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.  Since Rose bought 4 potatoes, Sophia bought 1 potato.

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 3 + 1 = 4 onions and potatoes.

"To determine the nephew's age, we can use a simple linear equation.  

Let 'x' represent the nephew's current age.  In seven years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This is because Shiloh's age in seven years will be three times the nephew's age in seven years.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3(x + 7) = 51

Solving for x:

1. 3x + 21 = 51
2. 3x = 30
3. x = 10

Therefore, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar contains a specific ratio of red, blue, and green jelly beans.  

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent this as 'b'. 
* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can represent this as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent this as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500. This means there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

To find the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* **Green jelly beans:** 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* **Red jelly beans:** 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

* Day 1: 4 feet
* Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
* Day 5: 32 * 2 = 64 feet

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago, and we can model this relationship using a linear equation.  

Let's denote Jerry's current age as 'x'.  Five years ago, he was 'x-5' years old.  We know that Jerry's current age is twice his age five years ago.  This translates to the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2x - 10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 per implant * 2 implants = $4000. The additional cost of the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the total cost of the dental work. His hourly wage is $15 per hour.  Therefore, the number of hours he needs to work is $4500 / $15 per hour = 300 hours.

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"Jim has a 20-piece pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  We know Jim chews gum at a rate of 1 piece every 2 hours.  He is at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:**  He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:**  Jim gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This can be expressed as s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplifying and solving for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Finally, substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g to find 's': s = 20 - 5 => s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Based on the established relationship between potatoes and hash browns, we can determine the number of hash browns produced from 96 potatoes.  

The key is understanding the proportionality.  If 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

Therefore, to find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6x = 36 * 96
* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

The percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is 60% of the total water usage. 

Therefore, the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes is 60% of 40% = 24%.

Since we can't have a fraction of a goat, Bubbles should purchase **5** goats to achieve the desired 30% representation.

"The overall pass rate can be calculated by considering the pass rates of each grade level.  

* Third grade: 340 out of 500 students passed, giving a pass rate of 0.68 or 68%.
* Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 students passed, giving a pass rate of 0.40 or 40%.
* Fifth grade: 400 out of 500 students passed, giving a pass rate of 0.80 or 80%.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to sum the pass rates of each grade level and divide by the total number of students. 

The overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

(0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80) / 3 = 1.88

The overall pass rate is 1.88 or 188%.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the optimal oil quantity for Tanya's salt scrub.

* **Understanding the Ratios:**  The key is to recognize the relationships between the ingredients.  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. This means we can express the quantities in terms of a common variable, 'x'.

* **Setting up the Equations:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Since zest = fragrance, we can express fragrance as 'x'.
    *  Salt = Sugar = 'x'
    *  Oil = 2 * Salt = 2 * 'x'
    *  Total ounces = 10

* **Solving for the Amount of Oil:**
    *  We know the total ounces of the mixture is 10.
    *  We can express the total ounces in terms of 'x' to find the amount of oil. 

Let me know if you'd like to continue solving for the amount of oil!

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to analyze the relationship between the number of cards each individual possesses.  

Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.  Smendrick has 3 times this amount, so he has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical trend.  We can analyze this by breaking down his production over the first three weeks:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars

To determine the production for week 4, we need to consider the total production over the first three weeks.  

* **Total Production (Weeks 1-3):** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Subtracting the total production from his monthly output, we can determine the production for week 4:

* **Week 4 Production:** 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

**Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars in week 4.**

"The installation cost for Angela's project is calculated as follows:

* **Mirrors:**  Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation is $529.00.

"Roy's savings are calculated based on a percentage increase relative to Anthony's savings.  We know Anthony saved $30.00, and Roy saved 40% more than Anthony.  To calculate Roy's savings, we can use the following formula:

Roy's Savings = Anthony's Savings * (1 + Percentage Increase)

Let's plug in the values:

Roy's Savings = $30.00 * (1 + 0.40)

Roy's Savings = $30.00 * 1.40

Roy's Savings = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has $42.00 saved.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We can determine this by analyzing the relationships between the individuals' abilities.

* **Saskay's lifting capacity:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. This means Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches. This means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting capacity:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches. This means Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert Naruto's lifting capacity to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet. 

**Answer:** 40 feet

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F: 
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the initial cost of the chickens, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens sold. 

* **Profit:** Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** Each chicken is sold for $50.
* **Number of Chickens Sold:** Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

To calculate the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the selling price: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Subtracting the profit from the total revenue, we can determine the initial cost: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias must have purchased the chickens for $7000.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago.  This means we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. 

* Duncan's age eight years ago:  Let Duncan's age eight years ago be represented by the variable 'x'.
* Adam's age four years ago:  Let Adam's age four years ago be represented by the variable 'y'.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago, so we can write the equation: x = 2y

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60.  Therefore, we can find Duncan's age eight years ago: x = 60.

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the equation: 60 = 2y.  Solving for y, we find that y = 30.

Finally, we can find Adam's current age: Adam's age four years ago was 30.  Therefore, Adam is currently 30 + 4 = 34 years old.

In 8 years, Adam will be 34 + 8 = **42 years old**.

    * John's age is 'J'

* **Formulate the equations:**
    * The combined age is 100:  P + (P + 10) + J = 100

    * Solve for J: J = 100 - 2P
    * Substitute J into the second equation: P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations based on the given information.  

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A + 20 = D + 10
* A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in cooperative game theory.  We can solve this by considering the distribution of chips.  

* **Let's denote the number of chips each of the three individuals receives as:**
    *  *x* = the number of chips received by the first two individuals
    *  *y* = the number of chips received by the third individual.

* **We know that:**
    * *x* + *y* = 140 (the total number of chips received by Amora and Lainey)
    * *x* = *y* + 15 (the third individual receives 15 more chips than the first two)

* **Solving for *x* and *y*:**
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: *y* + 15 + *y* = 140
    * Combine like terms: 2*y* + 15 = 140
    * Subtract 15 from both sides: 2*y* = 125
    * Divide both sides by 2: *y* = 62.5
    * Substitute the value of *y* back into the equation *x* = *y* + 15: *x* = 62.5 + 15 = 77.5

* **Therefore, the total number of chips is:**
    * *x* + *y* + *z* = 77.5 + 62.5 + 125 = 265

"Let's analyze the Pokemon situation.  We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a combined total of 339 Pokemon.  

To determine Stan's catch, we can use a strategic approach.  

* **Let's represent the Pokemon caught by each individual:**
    * Alex: A
    * Stan: S
    * Adelwolfe: W

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  
    * S = 4W - 13
    * A + S + W = 339

* **Solve for Stan's catch (S):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the net increase in his earnings. 

* **Income increase:** Jim's degree increases his annual income by $75,000, a 3-fold increase from his previous $25,000 annual salary.
* **Total income during college:** Over four years, he earns $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.
* **Total loan payments:** He pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000 in loans.
* **Total lost income:**  He loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Net income increase:**  Jim's net income increase is $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year.

To calculate the time to recoup his losses, we need to determine how many years it takes to earn $300,000.

"To determine the first person's share, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let's represent the first person's share as 'x'.  

The second person received $80 more than the first, so their share is 'x + $80'.  The third person received twice the amount the second person received, which is 2*(x + $80).

The total amount divided by the number of people is equal to the share of each person.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

(4x + $160) / 3 = $1920

Multiplying both sides by 3:

4x + $160 = $5760

Subtracting $160 from both sides:

4x = $5600

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = $1400

Therefore, the first person received $1400.

"The car's value depreciates by a constant 21% each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"Let's break down this fence problem using a strategic approach. 

We know the total fence length is 100 feet.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to determine the length of fence Harry has.  

* **Let 'x' represent the length of fence Sam has.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.**

We can set up an equation to represent this:

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Solving for 'x', we get:

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence length from the total fence length:

* 100 - 80 = 20

* **Initial Meat:**  Therefore, the initial amount of meat was 270 kilograms * 2 = 540 kilograms.

**Answer:** The triceratops had 540 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"The room requires a total of 120 square feet of paint.  To determine the cost, we need to know the paint coverage per gallon.  A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.  Therefore, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total area by the coverage per gallon.  

The total gallons needed is 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons.  

The cost of 6 gallons of paint is $12/gallon * 6 gallons = $72.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in jellyfish biology.  We know that a third of the large jellyfish, which represent a fifth of the total jellyfish population, undergo a color change under UV light.  This implies a direct relationship between the number of large jellyfish and the number of jellyfish undergoing color change.  

To determine the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following logic:

* **Large jellyfish:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of jellyfish.
* **Large jellyfish that change color:**  (1/3) * x 
* **Total jellyfish that change color:** 6 
* **Solving for x:**  (1/3) * x = 6
* **Therefore:** x = 18

"Lauren's retirement plan is a classic example of a long-term savings strategy.  To determine how many more years she needs to work, we need to consider her annual savings and living expenses. 

First, let's calculate her annual savings: 

* She saves 20% of her $100,000 annual salary, which is $20,000.

Next, we need to determine her annual living expenses:

* She plans to live on 40% of her salary, which is $40,000.

To calculate her annual savings after living expenses, we subtract her living expenses from her annual income:

* Her annual savings are $20,000, and she will spend $40,000 on living expenses, leaving her with $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 per year.

Now, let's determine how much she needs to save:

* She wants to save for 20 years, and her annual savings are $60,000. 

To calculate the total amount she needs to save, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years she's saving:

* She needs to save $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

Finally, we can determine how many years she needs to work:

* She needs to save $1,200,000 and her current savings are $0. 
* She needs to work for $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.


**Answer:** 20 years

Alfie's daily flight distance is 400 kilometers.  To find the number of days to cover half the circumference, we can use the following calculation:

* **Half the circumference:** 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers
* **Days to cover half the circumference:** 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie **50 days** to fly half the circumference of Earth.

"The fastest car ever made is a subject of ongoing debate, but based on historical records and performance benchmarks, the top contenders consistently exceed 200 mph.  

To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to consider the relative performance of different models.  

* **The 2nd fastest car:**  The 2nd fastest car is typically considered to be a high-performance model, often exceeding 200 mph.  
* **Average car:** The average car's speed is a benchmark for the general automotive market, typically around 120 mph. 

To calculate the speed of the fastest car, we can use the following formula:

**Fastest car speed = 2nd fastest car speed * 1.25**

**Fastest car speed = 600 mph * 1.25 = 750 mph**


**Answer:** 750 mph

"Let's break down the problem using a strategic approach. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  This can be represented as:

*  x + x = 2x 

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent this as:

* y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12

To find the number of eggs each person painted, we can use the following steps:

1.  Solve for y:
    *  2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
    *  2y = 44 - 2x
    *  y = 22 - x

2.  Solve for x:
    *  We know that x + x = 2x
    *  We also know that y = 22 - x
    *  Substitute the value of y into the equation: 22 - x + x = 2x
    *  Simplify: 22 = 2x
    *  Solve for x: x = 11

3.  Solve for Camden's eggs:
    *  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
    *  Camden painted 22 - 11 + 12 = 23 eggs

4.  Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:
    *  Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.
    *  The difference is 23 - 11 = 12

**Answer:**  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this relationship with the following equation:

*  Red Rope Length = 4 * (Blue Rope Length)

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  This can be represented as:

* Blue Rope Length = Yellow Rope Length - 7

We are given that the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can now set up an equation to solve for the length of the yellow rope:

* Yellow Rope Length + Blue Rope Length + Red Rope Length = 37

Substituting the expressions for the blue and red rope lengths, we get:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

* x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (x = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red Rope Length = 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"Colin's current age can be determined by analyzing the relationship between his age and Wendy's age in the future.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Wendy's age in the future:**  We know Wendy's age in 7 years will be 5 times Colin's age in 7 years. This can be represented as: W = 5(C + 7)
* **Colin's age in 25 years:**  We know in 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age. This can be represented as: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, we can solve for Colin's current age (C). 

**Solving for C:**

1. **Substitute:** Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20

3. **Isolate C:**
   (2/3)C = 5
   C = 25/2

**Therefore, Colin is currently 12.5 years old.**

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = (9 * 4) / 3

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between strawberry and blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5 times 'x' minus 4.  

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Solving for 'x', we get: 6x - 4 = 116.  
Adding 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 6: x = 20.

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn popping pattern.  The initial burst of popping is due to the rapid heating of the kernels, followed by a period of exponential growth.  The rate of popping then slows down as the kernels reach a peak of efficiency.  

The final 30 seconds of popping represent a critical phase, as the kernels are at their most efficient.  The residual heat from the pan will continue to pop kernels for a short period.  

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to consider the initial burst, the exponential growth, and the final burst.

* **Initial burst:** 20 kernels
* **Exponential growth:** 3 times the initial burst, or 60 kernels
* **Final burst:** 4 times the initial burst, or 240 kernels
* **Residual heat burst:** 1/4 of the final burst, or 60 kernels

**Total kernels:** 20 + 60 + 240 + 60 = **440 kernels**

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

2x + 16 = 96

2x = 80

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

"To determine the number of chickens, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
