"Josh's flip is a bit of a loss.  He spent $130,000 on the property, including the $50,000 in repairs.  The 150% increase in value means the house is now worth $120,000.  

To calculate his profit, we subtract the total cost from the increased value:

* **Profit = Increased Value - Total Cost**
* **Profit = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000**

Josh actually incurred a loss of $10,000.

"Melanie sold a total of 5 vacuum cleaners.  To find the initial number of vacuum cleaners she had, we need to work backwards.  

Let's break it down:

* **Total sold:** 5
* **Remaining:** 5
* **Sales at the green house:** 1/3 of her total vacuum cleaners sold.
* **Sales at the red house:** 2 more than the green house, so 5/3.
* **Sales at the orange house:** Half of the remaining vacuum cleaners.

Let's use a system of equations to solve for the initial number of vacuum cleaners. 

Let:
*  *x* represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

We can set up the following equations:

* 1/3 * *x* = 5 
* 5/3 + 2 = 5/2 
* 1/2 * (5/2 - 5) = 5

Solving for *x* in the first equation:
* *x* = 5 * 3 = 15

Therefore, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means their ages are proportional to each other.  

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age difference between them and how it will change over time. 

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:11 represents a constant relationship between their ages.  

* **Calculating the Change:**  We can use the concept of proportional change to find Allen's age in 10 years. 

Let's denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x.  

* **Age Difference:** The difference between their ages is 11x - 7x = 4x.

* **Age Difference in 10 Years:**  The age difference will also change by 4x in 10 years.

* **Allen's Age in 10 Years:**  To find Allen's age in 10 years, we need to add the change in age to his current age. 

**Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 11x + 10 = 11(9) + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109**

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for 'x', we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins, and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"To determine the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin, we need to consider the dragon's reach and the gemstone's effect. 

The dragon's fire has a radius of 1000 feet.  Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet, and with the gemstone, she can throw it 3 times farther. 

Therefore, with the gemstone, the javelin can be thrown 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.

To find the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it, we need to add the javelin's range to the dragon's reach. 

The maximum distance is 1200 feet + 1000 feet = 2200 feet.

"The truck's maximum capacity is 5000 pounds.  To determine the maximum number of boxes, we need to find the maximum weight the truck can carry after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck. 

The weight of the truck is 3755 pounds.  We can calculate the weight of the boxes by subtracting the weight of the truck from the total weight. 

The weight of the boxes is 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Katy's coffee recipe uses a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water.  We need to find the number of teaspoons of sugar she used when she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar.

To solve this, we can use the ratio to find the value of one part of the ratio.  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can represent the value of one part as 'x'. 

We know that 7x represents the amount of sugar used.  We can set up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons.

Solving for x, we get x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately).

This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 17.14 cups of water.

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We know his salary now is 1.4 times his salary four years ago. 

To find his current salary, we can use the following equation:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

We can use a similar approach to find Lylah's salary.  We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago.  

* We can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30

* We know Adrien's salary is $56,000. 

* We can solve for Lylah's salary: $56,000 / 1.30 = Lylah's salary 

* Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

* We can now calculate Lylah's salary now: $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later: $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300

*  Let 'x' represent the number of pink gumballs.
*  We know that 'x' is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.  This translates to the equation: x = 4 * blue gumballs + 22

Since we know there are 12 blue gumballs, we can substitute that into the equation:

x = 4 * 12 + 22

Solving for x:

x = 48 + 22

x = 70

Therefore, there are **70** pink gumballs in the machine.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is represented by 'S' and Brooke's age is represented by 'B'.
* We are given that S = 2B, meaning Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* The sum of their ages in two years will be 28.

To find Seth's current age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = 2B, we can substitute this into the equation: 2B + B + 2 = 28
2. **Simplify:** Combine the 'B' terms: 3B + 2 = 28
3. **Isolate B:** Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
4. **Solve for B:** Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* 60 seconds (first runner) + 3 seconds (second runner) + 3 seconds (third runner) + 3 seconds (fourth runner) = 69 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* 55 seconds (each runner) * 4 runners = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 220 seconds - 69 seconds = 151 seconds.

"The problem presents a classic chicken-egg scenario with a potential inconsistency.  Let's break it down:

* **Egg Production:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total Eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Chicken Ratio:**  The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve this, we need to find a way to express the number of red chickens in terms of the number of white chickens. 

**Let's use a system of equations:**

*  Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We can express the total number of chickens as:

*  r + w = total chickens

We can also express the number of eggs produced by the red and white chickens:

* 3r + 5w = total eggs

**Solving for 'r'**

We can use the information about the ratio of white to red chickens to express 'r' in terms of 'w'.  Since we know there are two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write:

* r = w + 2

Now, substitute this expression for 'r' into the equation for the total number of eggs:

* 3(w + 2) + 5w = total eggs

Simplify and solve for 'w':

* 3w + 6 + 5w = total eggs
* 8w + 6 = total eggs
* 8w = total eggs - 6

**The Problem:**

The problem statement is inconsistent.  We cannot have a fractional number of chickens.  


**Final Answer:**  The problem as stated is not solvable.

* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know the difference in snails between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both.  

*  The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
*  We need to find the number of fish in each aquarium.

Since the difference in snails is twice the number of fish, we can set up an equation: 28 = 2 * x.

Solving for x, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, each aquarium has 14 fish.

"The oil requires a specific heating profile for optimal cooking.  

* **Heating to 400 degrees:**  The oil takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees, so it takes 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes.

* **Stars in the third row:** 76 total stars - 24 stars = 52 stars
* **Stars in the 5-star rows:** 52 stars - 24 stars = 28 stars
* **Number of 5-star rows:** 28 stars / 5 stars/row = 5.6 rows

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, or 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

* Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  

* 480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

* t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business attire, luggage, and a flight.  

Let's analyze his spending:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Luggage:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight:** The flight cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so we can calculate that as follows: 
    * 5 * $100 = $500
    * $700 more than $500 is $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total Spending:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350
* **Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650
* **Gift Budget:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

"The team has a total of 105 players.  Let's break down the distribution:

* **Defense:**  Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.
* **Special Teams:**  The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning there are x/2 players on special teams.

The total number of players is the sum of these three groups: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can combine like terms: (7/2)x = 105

Multiplying both sides by 2/7, we get: x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

* Jam's pencils: 24

* **7 = 5 * (2 old records per new record)**
* **7 = 10 old records**

**Therefore, the 5 people brought in 10 old records.**

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.**

* **The size of the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 3 times the number of students in the equal groups.**

* **Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 200**

* **Solving for 'x', we get: x = 200 / 3 = 66.67**

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to adjust our thinking.**

* **The problem states that the groups are equal, so we can assume that the number of students in each group is a whole number.**

* **Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.**

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms:
* 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):
* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

"Morgan has a great budget for her birthday party!  To figure out how many friends she can invite, let's break down the costs:

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person.  
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

To figure out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the total cost of the activities.  

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Mini-golf:**  Let's say she invites 'x' number of friends. The cost of mini-golf for all her friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:** She wants to go twice, so the cost of go-karts is 10 * 2 = $20.

**Total cost:**  The total cost of the party is $5x + $20.

**To stay within her $90 budget, we need to find the value of 'x' that makes the total cost equal to or less than $90.**

**Let's set up an equation:**

5x + 20 = 90

**Solve for 'x':**

* 5x = 70
* x = 14

**Answer:** Morgan can invite 14 friends.

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles. 

The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, we need 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, the total stuffing needed is 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, meaning for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  The total number of popsicles they have is 165.  To find the number of popsicles Sam has, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of popsicles Sam has.
*  The ratio of popsicles Betty has to Sam's popsicles is 5/6.
*  The total number of popsicles is 165.

We can set up the proportion: 5/6 = 75/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 5 * x = 6 * 75

Simplifying the equation: 5x = 450

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 90

Therefore, Sam has 90 popsicles.  To find the difference between Sam's popsicles and Betty's, we subtract: 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel can save a significant amount of energy by reducing his AC usage.  Here's how to calculate the savings:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:**  The AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours a day, so his daily energy consumption is 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours.
* **Reduced Usage:**  He reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, so his daily energy consumption is now 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours.
* **Energy Savings:**  The energy saved per day is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.
* **Total Savings in 30 Days:**  Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-Hour Conversion:**  1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours. Therefore, the total energy saved in kWh is 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = **135 kWh**.

* **Calculate the number of corn:** He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 100 * 2 = 200 corn.
* **Calculate the combined total:** The total number of corn and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corn and cannolis Allan has in the house is 300.

* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

"The problem presents a classic case of simultaneous equations.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries using a simple substitution method. 

Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

* **Total Earnings = Price per Card * Number of Cards**

We know the total earnings need to be $100.  Let's represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.

* **1.5x = $100**

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it.  Divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

* **x = $100 / 1.5**
* **x = 66.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.  Kenny needs to sell approximately **67** cards.

Let's break it down:

* **Venue 1:**  The fixed cost is $200, and the cost per guest is $5.  
* **Venue 2:** The cost per guest is $25.

Setting the cost equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * x = $25 * x

Solving for 'x':

$200 = $20 * x

x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are needed for the two venues to have the same cost.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Suzie purchased four packs of gum in total.  She bought two packs of strawberry gum, which cost $2.00 per pack.  She also purchased a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the strawberry gum, which cost $1.00.  The total cost of the gum was $7.00.  

To find the cost of the strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = (Cost of strawberry gum) + (Cost of green apple gum)

We know the total cost is $7.00 and the cost of the green apple gum is $1.00.  We can solve for the cost of the strawberry gum by substituting the values into the equation:

$7.00 = (Cost of strawberry gum) + $1.00

Subtracting $1.00 from both sides of the equation, we get:

$6.00 = (Cost of strawberry gum)

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up an equation:

* Rose's onions: 12
* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.  

To find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the same logic:

* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 3
* Sophia's potatoes: 4 - 3 = 1

Sophia bought a total of 3 onions and 1 potato.

"To determine the nephew's age, we can use a simple linear equation.  

Let 'x' represent the nephew's current age.  In seven years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This means that the nephew's age in seven years will be three times Shiloh's age in seven years.  

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
x + 7 = 3 * (51)

Solving for x, we get:
x + 7 = 153
x = 153 - 7
x = 146

Therefore, the nephew is currently 146 years old.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar has a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  

*  The number of red jelly beans is 99% of the blue jelly beans, which we can represent as 0.99b.
*  The number of green jelly beans is 101% of the blue jelly beans, which we can represent as 1.01b.

To find the number of jelly beans in each category, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to find the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar has 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500.

To calculate the remaining amount George needs to pay, we subtract his deposit from the total cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900.

To figure out how many hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours. 


**Answer:**  George needs to work approximately 126.67 hours.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the total chocolate pounds produced by Ruiz and Marissa, we need to consider their individual production rates and the total work hours. 

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz produces 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, which translates to a production rate of 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's production:** Marissa produces 3/4 times Ruiz's production, meaning she produces (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

**Total production:** Over 12 hours, Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa produces 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.  

Therefore, the total production for both is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"Jim has a 20-pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s). To convert this to megabits per second (Mb/s), we need to know that 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits. 

Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20 kb/s * 1000 = 20000 bits per second. 

To convert bits per second to megabits per hour, we need to consider that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.  

Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20000 bits/s * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72000000 bits/hour. 

Finally, we need to convert bits per hour to megabits per hour. 

Her internet connection speed is 72000000 bits/hour / 1000 = **72 Mb/hour**.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the total number of legs and heads. 

* **Let 's' represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let 'g' represent the number of geese.**

We know the following:

* **Total legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 
* **Total heads:** s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in the second equation, we get: g = 20 - s.

Substituting this value of 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to understand the relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns.  

The key is to recognize that the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is consistent.  

* **Direct Proportion:**  If 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns, we can use this ratio to calculate the hash browns from 96 potatoes. 

* **Calculation:**  
   *  We can set up a proportion: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns
   *  Cross-multiply: 6 * x = 36 * 96
   *  Simplify: 6x = 3456

"The regulation passed with a majority of 2x votes in favor, where x represents the number of votes against.  Since there were 33 people on the council, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Solving for x:

x = 33 / 3 = 11

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Ratios:**  The key here is recognizing the relationships between the ingredients. Tanya uses a consistent ratio of ingredients, which means we can use this to find the exact amounts.

* **Setting up the Variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Using the Given Information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know she uses 10 ounces of the mixture.

* **Solving for the Amount of Oil (o):**
    *  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    *  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x
    *  We know x = zest, so o = 4z

* **Finding the Amount of Oil (o):**

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20.  Therefore, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.  

If Joe sells 20% of his cars, he will have 40 * 0.20 = 8 cars remaining.  

He then gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

Joe then has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars remaining.

"Let's analyze the card distribution.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    *  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Total cards:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47

* **Calculate Becca's cards:**
    * Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Milly's return will result in a loss of $21.00.  Here's why:

* **Shipping Cost:** The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds and is 20 miles away, resulting in a total shipping cost of $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.
* **Refund:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.00 * 0.75 = $24.00. 
* **Final Loss:**  The total cost Milly will incur is $3.00, and she will receive a refund of $24.00, resulting in a loss of $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical pattern.  Let's break it down:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars (half of Week 1)
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars (three times Week 1)

To find Week 4 production, we need to consider the total production over the first three weeks.  

* **Total Production (Weeks 1-3):** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

To find Week 4 production, we subtract the total production from his monthly output: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can use the following logic:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:** Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

To find the time for four turtles, we need to consider the distance and the speed of the turtles. 

**Therefore, the time for four turtles to travel the same distance as three kangaroos is 36 hours.**

"Brenda's investment will grow to $975 after 3 years.  

Here's how to calculate the total amount:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + rt) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"To solve this problem, let's break it down using a system of equations. 

Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.  We know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books.  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, meaning she has F - 12 + 25 books.

The total number of books is the sum of these three: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F:
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we need to consider the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.


**Answer:** 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We need to find Peter's age.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Peter's age is represented by ""P""
    * Paul's age is ""P + 10"" (10 years older than John)
    * John's age is ""J""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information and apply a bit of algebraic reasoning. 

Let's represent the points scored by each individual:

* **Dinar:**  Let's call Dinar's score ""D""
* **Azibo:**  Let's call Azibo's score ""A""
* **Bahati:**  Let's call Bahati's score ""B""

We know the following:

* **B = A + 20:** Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo.
* **B = D + 10:** Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.

We also know the total points scored by the team is 45.  Therefore:

* **A + D + B = 45**

Now, let's substitute the values of B from the first two equations into the third equation:

* **A + D + (A + 20) = 45**

Simplify the equation:

* **2A + D + 20 = 45**

We can solve for D:

* **D = 45 - 2A - 20**
* **D = 25 - 2A**

We can substitute this value of D back into the equation for B:

* **B = (25 - 2A) + 10**
* **B = 35 - 2A**

Now, we can use the first equation to find A:

* **B = A + 20**
* **35 - 2A = A + 20**
* **-3A = -15**
* **A = 5**

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are on a Pokemon-catching quest! 

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    *  We can use the first two equations to express 'S' in terms of 'A' and 'W'. 
    *  Substitute the first equation into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    *  Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    *  Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    *  Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    *  Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the time it takes to recoup the loan and lost income, we need to consider the total earnings from the degree and the time spent in college. 

* **Earnings from the degree:**  A degree can significantly increase earning potential.  In this case, Jim's income is tripled, meaning he earns $75,000 per year.
* **Total earnings from the degree:** Over four years, he earns $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.
* **Total loan payments:** Jim has $50,000 in annual loan payments. Over four years, he pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.
* **Total lost income:**  Jim loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.

To calculate the time to recoup the total cost of the loans and lost income, we need to find the time it takes to earn $300,000. 

**Time to recoup:**  To earn $300,000, it would take Jim 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years. 


**Answer:** 4 years

"Jim needs fabric for a king-sized bed, which is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To ensure a proper fit, he'll need two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  

The fabric pieces will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The area of the bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

To calculate the area of each fabric piece, we multiply the length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"The car's value depreciates by 21% each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"James's insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  His normal monthly premium is $120.  To calculate his annual premium, we need to consider the increased cost.

The increased cost is 60% of his normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his new monthly premium is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find his annual premium, we multiply his monthly premium by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

Greg washes 5 beds per week, and his machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.  Therefore, he can wash 5 beds / 2 sets/load = 2.5 loads per week. 

Greg washes 2.5 loads per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so he washes 2.5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 130 loads per year.

"Let's break down the problem:

*  We know the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.
*  Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.

To find the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent Donovan's portion time.
*  Betsy's portion time is 'x + 18'.

Therefore:

*  x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

*  2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

*  2x = 80
*  x = 40

Now, we can find Betsy's portion time:

*  Betsy's portion time = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the total fence length is 100 feet, and Harry is given 60 feet more than Sam.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to find the value of 'x' representing the length Sam has.

*  We can set up an equation: x + (x + 60) = 100
*  Combining like terms: 2x + 60 = 100
*  Subtracting 60 from both sides: 2x = 40
*  Dividing both sides by 2: x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence length: 100 - 20 = 80 feet. 


**Answer:** 80 feet

"Marcel's sales figures are quite interesting!  Let's break down the revenue by bike type:

* **Trekking bikes:**  We know 150 of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking, representing a significant portion of his sales.
* **BMX bikes:**  The 45 BMX bikes sold represent a smaller portion, but still contribute to his overall revenue.
* **MTB bikes:**  The remaining 105 MTB bikes are the most profitable, as they are priced at a higher value.

To calculate Marcel's total revenue, we need to consider the price of each bike type and the number sold. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Trekking bikes:** 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* **BMX bikes:** 45 bikes * ($500/bike / 2) = $11,250
* **MTB bikes:** 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

**Total revenue:** $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = **$131,250**

"The biggest slide at Five Flags is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet per minute.  To determine the difference in ride time, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each slide.

For the biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in ride time is: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"The problem states that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and 6 jellyfish changed color in total.  To find the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following logic:

* **Large jellyfish:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of jellyfish. Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we know x/5 = the number of large jellyfish.
* **Change in color:**  We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and this represents 1/3 of the large jellyfish. 
* **Solving for x:**  We can set up an equation to solve for x: (1/3) * x = 6.  Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us x = 18. 

Therefore, there are **18** jellyfish in the tank.

"Let's break down this retirement planning scenario.  

To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to consider her savings rate and her desired retirement savings goal. 

* **Savings Rate:** Lauren saves 20% of her annual income.
* **Retirement Goal:** She aims to save for 20 years.
* **Current Income:** Her annual salary is $100,000.

**Calculating the Savings Needed:**

To determine how much she needs to save, we need to consider her annual savings and the total time she'll be saving.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 2x eggs.
* Camden and Sarah painted a total of 2y + 12 eggs.
* We can express this as a system of equations:
    * 2x + 2y = 56 
    * y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12

Solving for y in the second equation:
* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

Now, we can substitute this value of y back into the first equation:
* 2x + 2(22 - x) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x = 56
* 44 = 56

This equation is not true, which means there is an error in the given information.  

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently stated.**

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons and boxes:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this with the following equations:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can set up an equation to solve for 'x':

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (x = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.


**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"The mural is divided into three equal sections, with each section containing red, white, and purple paint.  Since half the mural is yellow, we know that the yellow section represents 1/2 of the total paint.  

To find the amount of red paint, we can use the following equation:

* **Total paint = (Red + White + Purple) * 3**
* **Yellow paint = 1/2 * Total paint**

We know the total paint is 12 pints.  Let's substitute this into the equation:

* **12 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 3**
* **6 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 1/2**

We can solve for the amount of red paint by dividing both sides of the equation by 1/2:

* **12 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 3**
* **12 pints / 3 = (Red + White + Purple) * 1/2**
* **4 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 1/2**

Now, we can solve for the amount of red paint by dividing both sides of the equation by 1/2:

* **4 pints / 1/2 = (Red + White + Purple) * 1/2**
* **8 pints = (Red + White + Purple) * 1/2**
* **16 pints = (Red + White + Purple)**

Therefore, the amount of red paint is 16 pints.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs, we need to consider the number of slices consumed and the number of slices per pizza. 

* **Cheese Pizza:** Kate consumes 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese pizza slices.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** Kate consumes 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni pizza slices.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removed, we need to consider the time spent on each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters** 


The total amount of water removed is **30 liters**.

"The jelly bean jar's volume is calculated as 540 cubic inches.  To determine the number of red jelly beans, we need to consider the packing efficiency.  

The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning that 80% of the space within the jar is effectively used for the jelly beans.  

The volume of the jelly beans is calculated as 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.  

To determine the number of red jelly beans, we divide the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean, which is 0.15 cubic inches.  

The number of red jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

The difference between the estimated number of red jelly beans and the actual number is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

"Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is then 5x - 4.  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is x + (5x - 4) = 116.  Solving for x, we get 6x - 4 = 116, so 6x = 120, and x = 20.

Therefore, we can represent the number of blue and yellow blocks as 4x and 2x respectively.  The total number of blocks is 32.  We can set up an equation to solve for the number of red blocks: 4x + 2x + x = 32.  Simplifying the equation, we get 7x = 32.  Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 4.  Therefore, there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  The total number of blocks is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks, so the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"James is currently 18 years old, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  To find James's age, we can use the following formula:

Age = (Years since birth) * (Age of the child)

Since James was born when John was 19, we can calculate his age by:

Age = (19 - 1) * 2

Therefore, James is currently 18 years old. 

To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we can use the following formula:

Age = (Years since birth) + 3

Since John's youngest son was born when John was 32, we can calculate his age by:

Age = 32 + 3 = 35

Therefore, John's youngest son will be 35 years old in 3 years.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total number of animals is 20.
* Each animal has either 2 or 4 legs.
* We need to find the number of chickens.

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.  Since each chicken has 2 legs, we can represent the total number of chicken legs as 2c.

We also know that the total number of legs is 70.  The total number of legs for the cows is 4w.  

We can set up an equation: 2c + 4w = 70

We can solve for 'c' by using the fact that the total number of animals is 20.  This means c + w = 20.  Solving for 'w', we get w = 20 - c.

Now we can substitute this value of 'w' into the equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying the equation: 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
