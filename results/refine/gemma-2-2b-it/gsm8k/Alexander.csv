"Josh's investment in the house is a classic example of a ""flip"" scenario.  While the initial purchase price and repairs are important, the key to profitability lies in the market value appreciation.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Investment:** Josh's initial investment is $130,000 ($80,000 purchase + $50,000 repairs).
* **Appreciation:** The house's value increased by 150% of its original purchase price, meaning it's now worth $120,000 more than it was before the repairs.
* **Profit:**  The profit is the difference between the sale price and the initial investment.  However, in this case, the house is not selling for a profit.  The house is worth $120,000 more than the initial investment, but the total cost of the house is $130,000.  

**Therefore, Josh incurred a loss of $10,000.**

"Melanie sold a total of 5 vacuum cleaners, and she has 5 left.  To determine the initial number of vacuum cleaners, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners.**

* **Green House:**  She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving 2/3 of the original amount.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house than the green house, meaning she sold 5/3 + 2 = 11/3 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, meaning she sold 1/2 * (2/3 + 11/3) = 1/2 * 13/3 = 13/6 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

* **Total Sold:**  The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 1/3 + 11/3 + 13/6 = 10/2 = 5.

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the following equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:

18x = 162

Solving for x:

x = 162 / 18 = 9

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:

99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for 'x', we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins, and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Dana's speed profile is interesting.  Let's break down her travel time and distance.

* **Running:**  Her running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, meaning her running speed is 4 * her walking speed.
* **Walking:**  We know her walking speed is 3 miles per hour.  
* **Running Time:**  She spends 2 hours running.
* **Walking Time:** She spends 4 hours walking.

To calculate her total distance, we can use the following formula:

**Walking Distance:**
* Walking Distance = Speed * Time
* Walking Distance = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

**Total Distance:**
* Total Distance = 24 miles + 12 miles = 36 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 36 miles in six hours.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's.  This means Gerald's time is the base, and we need to find his new time after his diet change.

* **Let's represent Gerald's original time:**  Let Gerald's original time be represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Lee's original time:** Lee's original time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time was 'x + 2' seconds.
* **Gerald's improved time:**  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:
   x + 2 = 38 
* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 36
* **Calculate Gerald's new time:** Gerald's new time is x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

* To find Lylah's salary, we need to consider that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than hers.  

* We can calculate Lylah's salary four years ago by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30: $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).

* We can then calculate Lylah's salary now by adding 40% to her previous salary: $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

* Finally, to find their total salary four years later, we add their current salaries: $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of pink gumballs.
*  We know that 'x' is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.  This translates to the equation: x = 4 * blue gumballs + 22

Since we know there are 12 blue gumballs, we can substitute that into the equation:

x = 4 * 12 + 22

Simplifying the equation:

x = 48 + 22

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"The hive's population is structured in a specific ratio.  We know there are 700 bees in total.  Let's break down the relationship between the bee types:

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is the foundation of the hive's structure.
* **Baby Bees:**  The number of baby bees (b) is directly proportional to the number of queens.  
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are the most numerous, and their number is directly related to the number of baby bees.

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

* **w = 2b** 

We can also express this relationship in terms of the number of queens:

* **b = 2q**

Now, let's use the total bee population to solve for the number of worker bees.

**Total Bees = Queens + Baby Bees + Worker Bees**

700 = q + 2q + 2(2q)

700 = q + 2q + 4q

700 = 7q

q = 100

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:

* **w = 2b**
* **w = 2 * (2q)**
* **w = 2 * (2 * 100)**
* **w = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'.
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'.

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

From the first equation, we can express S in terms of B: S = 2B.

Substituting this into the second equation: 
2B + B + 2 = 28

Combining like terms: 
3B + 2 = 28

Subtracting 2 from both sides:
3B = 26

Dividing both sides by 3:
B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now, we can find Seth's age by substituting the value of B back into the equation S = 2B:
S = 2 * 8.67
S = 17.34 (approximately)

Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.

"Zaid's monthly expenses are quite substantial.  He spends 1/4 of his income on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and then donates half of the remaining amount to charity.  This means his total expenses are 1/4 + 1/3 = 7/12 of his income.  

After these expenses, he has $6000 - (7/12 * $6000) = $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.  He then donates half of this remaining amount to charity, leaving him with $2500 / 2 = $1250.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* Runner 1: 60 seconds
* Runner 2: 63 seconds
* Runner 3: 66 seconds
* Runner 4: 69 seconds

Total time: 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* Runner 1: 55 seconds
* Runner 2: 55 seconds
* Runner 3: 55 seconds
* Runner 4: 55 seconds

Total time: 55 * 4 = 220 seconds

The difference in time is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used and the number of rats. 

* **Straw Distribution:** We know 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents.
* **Hamster Straw Usage:** 10 cages of hamsters used 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rat Straw Usage:**  The remaining straw, 110 pieces, is for the rats.

**Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used by the straw per rat: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.

**Rat Per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a price of $30 each.  This implies that the total revenue from selling the bags was $30 * x, where x is the number of bags sold.  

The total cost of the bags is $20 * x, as each bag costs $20.  The total expenses are the sum of the cost of the bags and the transportation cost, which is $2 * x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total expenses.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

$400 = $30x - ($20x + $2x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$400 = $10x

Solving for x, we find:

x = $400 / $10

x = 40

Therefore, the trader sold **40** bags.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for an unknown quantity.  Let's break down the information provided and formulate a system of equations to represent the given scenario.

* **Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.**

We are given the following:

* **Total chickens:** r + w = Total Chickens
* **Egg production:** 3r + 5w = Total Eggs Collected

We are also given that there are two more white chickens than red chickens. This translates to:

* **Red chickens:** r = w + 2

**Solving for 'r'**

We can use the second equation to substitute the value of 'r' in the first equation:

* (w + 2) + w = Total Chickens
* 2w + 2 = Total Chickens

Now, we can use the information about the total number of eggs collected to solve for 'w'. 

* 3(w + 2) + 5w = Total Eggs Collected
* 3w + 6 + 5w = Total Eggs Collected
* 8w + 6 = Total Eggs Collected

**The Problem**

The problem statement is flawed.  The number of eggs collected cannot be determined with the given information.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, or 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following equation:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Ali and Izzy have a combined total of 39 medals.  We also know that they represent a fraction of the total medals awarded.  To find the total number of medals given out, we need to figure out how many medals represent Ali and Izzy's total. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as 'x'.  We can set up an equation:

* Ali and Izzy's medals: 39
* Total medals given out: x

We know that Ali and Izzy's medals represent 1/10th of the total medals given out.  Therefore:

* 39 = (1/10) * x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

* 390 = x

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business attire, luggage, and a flight.  

Let's analyze his expenses:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Luggage:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight:** The flight cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so we can calculate it as follows: 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

**Total Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

**Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650

"The team's composition is a classic example of a ratio problem.  Let's break it down:

* **Defense:**  We know the defense is represented by 'x' players.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2x players.
* **Special Teams:**  The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning there are x/2 players.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for 'x', we need to simplify the equation:

(7/2)x = 105

Multiply both sides by (2/7) to isolate 'x':

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.  To fully charge the phone, we need to determine the time required to accumulate 100% charge.  

The phone needs to gain 40% of charge (100% - 60% = 40%).  

To calculate the time, we can use the following formula:

Time = (Charge Required / Charging Rate) * 60

Charge Required = 40% = 0.40
Charging Rate = 1% per 3 minutes

Time = (0.40 / 0.01) * 60 = 2400 minutes

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size.  The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
* The size of the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

Solving for 'x', we get: 3x - 10 = 200
                                       3x = 210
                                       x = 70

Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = **60** students.

"Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party.  To figure out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the costs of mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Arcade Tokens:** She has $5 for arcade tokens.
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

To find the maximum number of friends she can invite, let's consider the total cost:

* **Mini-golf:** $5 * number of friends
* **Go-karts:** $10 * number of rides
* **Total Cost:** $5 (mini-golf) + $10 (go-karts) * number of friends

We need to find the number of friends that will allow her to stay within her $90 budget. 

**Let's set up an equation:**

5 * number of friends + 10 * number of rides = 90

**To solve for the number of friends, we need to find the maximum number of friends that can be invited while staying within the budget.**

"The problem presents a classic case of simultaneous equations.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries using a simple substitution method. 

Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"The problem presents a classic ratio-based scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**  This is our starting point.
* **The statement ""1% fewer red jelly beans than blue"" translates to (0.99)b red jelly beans.**  This means the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans.
* **The statement ""1% more green jelly beans than blue"" translates to (1.01)b green jelly beans.** This means the number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans.

**To find the number of jelly beans, we can set up an equation:**

b + (0.99)b + (1.01)b = 4500

**Solving for 'b':**

1. Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
2. Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: (1.01) * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: (0.99) * 1500 = 1495

**Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.**

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 

To calculate the remaining amount George needs to pay, we subtract his deposit from the total cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900.

To figure out how many hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours. 


**Answer:**  George needs to work 126.67 hours.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

We know that the sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s). To convert this to megabits per second (Mb/s), we need to know that 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits. 

Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20 kb/s * 1000 = 20000 bits per second.  

To convert bits per second to megabits per hour, we need to consider that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (The total number of heads is 20)

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: 
* s = 20 - g

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1:
* 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

Simplify and solve for 'g':
* 80 - 4g + 2g = 70
* -2g = -10
* g = 5

Now that we know 'g' (the number of geese), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find 's':
* s + 5 = 20
* s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Let's break down the problem:

We need to determine the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub.  

* **Key Relationships:**
    *  The ratio of salt to sugar is equal to the ratio of zest to fragrance.
    *  The ratio of oil to salt is twice the ratio of salt to zest.

* **Solving for the Amount of Oil:**
    *  Let's represent the amount of zest as 'x'.  
    *  Since the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, we can represent the amount of salt as 'x'.
    *  The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is 2x.

* **Final Answer:**  Tanya uses **2x** ounces of oil.

"Let's analyze the card distribution.  

* **Let's represent the number of cards PJ has:**  We'll use the variable 'x' to represent the number of cards PJ has.

* **Smendrick's cards:** Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.

* **Becca's cards:** Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Total cards:** The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solving for x:**  Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we have 7x = 329.  Dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 47.

* **Becca's cards:**  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical pattern.  Let's break it down:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:**  He produces half of week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the output of week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the output for week 4, we need to subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We are given a system of equations representing the relationships between the ages of the three individuals. 
*  The key is to use these equations to isolate the variable representing the age of the individual in question. 

Let's analyze the given information:

*  ""I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister."" This translates to the following relationships:
    *  x = brother's age
    *  x + 3 = your age
    *  x - 2 = sister's age

*  ""My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age."" This translates to:
    *  Mom's age = 3(brother's age) - 1

*  ""When you add all our ages, you get 87."" This translates to:
    *  x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(brother's age) - 1) = 87

**Solving for x:**

*  Simplifying the equation:
    *  3x + 1 + 3(x + 3) - 2 = 87
    *  3x + 1 + 3x + 9 - 2 = 87
    *  6x + 8 = 87
    *  6x = 79
    *  x = 79/6

**Finding the age of the individual in question:**

*  Since x represents the age of the individual in question, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation to find the age of the individual in question. 

**Answer:** 79/6

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We are given that Paul is 10 years older than John.  We are also told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's represent the ages:

* Peter's age: P
* Paul's age: P + 10
* John's age: J

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We can simplify this equation:

2P + J = 100

We can also express Peter's age in terms of Paul and John's ages:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now, we can substitute the value of J from the first equation into the second equation:

P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)

Simplifying this equation:

P = P + 10 + 100 - 2P
3P = 110
P = 36.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.

* He then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour, totaling 70 pesos * 2 hours = 140 pesos. 
* Therefore, Cameron would have saved 600 pesos + 140 pesos = 740 pesos.

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information and apply algebraic reasoning. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A + 20 = D + 10
* A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45
* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that the total number of chips is represented by a variable, 'x'.  We also know that the number of chips each person gets is determined by the number of people involved.  

* **Let's represent the number of people as 'n'.** 
* **The number of chips each person gets is then 'x/n'.**

We are given that two people get an equal amount of chips, and the remaining person gets 15 more than the others.  This can be represented as:

* **x/n = 70** 
* **x/n = 70 + 15**

We can solve for 'x' by substituting the second equation into the first equation:

* **x/n = 85**

We can then solve for 'n' by substituting the value of 'x' into the equation:

* **n = x/85**

We know that the total number of chips is represented by 'x'.  We can solve for 'x' by substituting the value of 'n' into the equation:

* **x = 85 * n**

We can then substitute the value of 'n' into the equation:

* **x = 85 * (x/85)**

This simplifies to:

* **x = x**

This means that the total number of chips is equal to the number of chips each person gets.  

**Therefore, the total number of chips is 85.**

"Stan caught 151 Pokemon.  

Let's break it down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * A = number of Pokemon Alex caught
    * S = number of Pokemon Stan caught
    * W = number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5  
    * S = 4W - 13
    * A + S + W = 339

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

"To determine Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to consider the orbital period of Halley's Comet.  

The comet's orbital period is 75 years.  Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, we can calculate the age difference between the two sightings. 

The time elapsed between the two sightings is 90 - 30 = 60 years.  

Therefore, Bill saw the comet for the first time 75 years before he saw it a second time.

"The first plane operates with a fixed schedule, and we can determine the number of flights to France by analyzing the proportion of flights it undertakes. 

The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, leaving a quarter for flights to France and Germany.  Since the other plane flies exclusively to Poland, we can deduce that the first plane's flights are the primary factor in determining the total number of flights to France. 

Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes as 'x'.  

* **Greece:** (3/4)x
* **France/Germany:** (1/4)x

The other plane makes 22 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**

"Marcus's homework situation presents a classic probability problem with multiple potential outcomes.  Let's analyze the probabilities:

* **Substitute Teacher:** There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework.
* **Normal Teacher:** There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension.
* **Extension:** Even if the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possible scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension.
* **Scenario 2:** Normal teacher, no extension.
* **Scenario 3:** Normal teacher, extension.
* **Scenario 4:** Substitute teacher, extension.

The probability of each scenario is:

* **Scenario 1:** 0.50 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 2:** 0.50 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 3:** 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20
* **Scenario 4:** 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20

The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.20 = **0.80**

**Therefore, the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 80%.**

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

* 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan spent 40 minutes on the meal preparation.

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"The glee club consumed 14 pizzas, and the football team consumed 32 pizzas.  To find the number of pizzas remaining, we must first determine the total number of pizzas consumed.  The total number of pizzas consumed is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.  The total number of pizzas remaining is 20 - 46 = -26.  This result is not possible, as we cannot have a negative number of pizzas.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down this fence problem.  

We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to determine the amount of fencing Harry has.

* **Let 'x' represent the length of fencing Sam has.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fencing.**

The total length of fencing is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Solving for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fencing from the total:

* 100 - 80 = 20

**Answer:** Sam has 20 feet of fencing left.

"Marcel's bicycle sales are quite straightforward.  We can break down the revenue by bike type:

* **Trekking bikes:**  The Trekking bikes are the most popular, accounting for half of his sales.  
* **BMX bikes:**  BMX bikes are priced at half the price of MTBs, making them a good volume seller.
* **MTB bikes:**  MTB bikes are the most expensive, but they also represent a significant portion of his sales.

To calculate Marcel's total revenue, we need to consider the number of bikes sold for each type and their respective prices. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Trekking bikes:** 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* **BMX bikes:** 45 bikes * ($500/bike / 2) = $11,250
* **MTB bikes:** 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

**Total revenue:** $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = **$131,250**

"The scenario presents a classic example of predator-prey dynamics.  Let's break it down:

* **T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, indicating the T-Rex consumed half of the initial amount. 
* **Velociraptor's Contribution:** The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex's consumption. 

To determine the original weight of the triceratops, we need to consider the following:

* **The T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining 270 kilograms, meaning the T-Rex ate half of that. 
* **The Velociraptors' Contribution:** The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex's consumption. 

Therefore, the triceratops had 135 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

"The problem states that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color under UV light.  This means that the number of large jellyfish is 5/10 of the total number of jellyfish.  We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(5/10) * total jellyfish = 6

To solve for the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10/5:

total jellyfish = (6 * 10) / 5

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish is 12.

"Let's break down this retirement planning scenario.  

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to consider her savings rate and her projected expenses. 

* **Savings Rate:** Lauren saves 20% of her annual income, which is a common approach to retirement planning.
* **Living Expenses:**  She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is a standard approach for retirement planning.

**Calculating the Savings Gap:**

To determine how much more she needs to save, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to accumulate over 20 years. 

* **Total Savings Needed:**  Lauren needs to save $1,200,000 over 20 years.

**Determining the Timeframe:**

To figure out how many years she needs to work, we can use the following formula:

* **Years to Work:** Total Savings Needed / Annual Savings Rate = Years to Work

**Calculation:**

* Years to Work = $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years

"Let's break down the problem:

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  Since they painted the same number, we can represent this as:

*  Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent this as:

*  Camden's eggs + Sarah's eggs = 30

We can further break down the information about Camden and Sarah's eggs:

*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. 

To solve for the number of eggs each person painted, we can use the following steps:

1.  **Find the number of eggs Sarah painted:**
    *  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 
    *  We can represent this as:  Camden's eggs = Sarah's eggs + 12
    *  We can substitute this into the equation for the total eggs painted by Camden and Sarah:  (Sarah's eggs + 12) + Sarah's eggs = 30
    *  Simplifying the equation: 2 * Sarah's eggs + 12 = 30
    *  Solving for Sarah's eggs: 2 * Sarah's eggs = 18
    *  Therefore, Sarah's eggs = 9

2.  **Find the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted:**
    *  We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. 
    *  We can represent this as: Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56
    *  We can substitute the value of Sarah's eggs into the equation: Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56
    *  We know that Sarah's eggs = 9, so we can substitute this into the equation: Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56
    *  We can solve for the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline: 2 * (Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs) = 56
    *  Simplifying the equation: 2 * (Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs) = 56
    *  Solving for Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs: Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 28

3.  **Find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:**
    *  We know that Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.
    *  The difference is 23 - 11 = 12

"To determine the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to consider the earnings from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets. 

* **Earnings from sunflowers:** Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers, and each sunflower sells for $2.  Therefore, he sold $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.
* **Earnings from bouquets:** He earned $56 from bouquets, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.  This means he sold 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets.
* **Total sunflowers sold:**  He sold 13 sunflowers from individual sales and 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers. 

Therefore, Faraday sold a total of 13 + 84 = **97** sunflowers after 3 days.

"Adam's business model has a few key weaknesses.  He's assuming a 60% sell-through rate, which is a very optimistic assumption.  In reality, the market for rocks is highly competitive, and he'll likely sell a much lower percentage of his inventory.  

To maximize his profit, Adam should consider a few things:

* **Pricing:**  He should consider adjusting his pricing to reflect the market value of the rocks.  
* **Inventory Management:**  He should carefully manage his inventory to avoid overstocking and potential losses. 
* **Marketing:**  He should invest in effective marketing strategies to attract customers and increase his sales. 


Let's break down the potential losses:

* **Initial Investment:** Adam has $100 to start.
* **Cost of Inventory:**  He can purchase 20 rocks at $5 each, totaling $100.
* **Potential Revenue:**  If he sells 60% of his inventory, he could potentially make $84. 
* **Loss:**  The potential loss is $16.

"The avocado tree's fruit production follows a clear pattern:

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree produces a consistent 50 fruits per year.
* **Year 6-8:**  The production increases by a factor of 3, then 7, and then 200 less than the previous year. 
* **Year 9:** The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:** The tree produces 20 times the initial production.

To calculate the total fruit production, we need to consider the production for each year and sum them up. 

**Total fruit production:** 

* Year 1-5: 50 fruits/year * 5 years = 250 fruits
* Year 6: 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits
* Year 7: 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits
* Year 8: 350 fruits - 200 fruits = 150 fruits
* Year 9: 0 fruits
* Year 10: 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits

**Total: 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits**

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this with the following equations:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  Therefore:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the red rope is 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial amounts:** Ronnie had $5, and Rissa had 3 * $5 = $15.
* **Giving to sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount, which we'll call 'x'.  
* **Rissa's remaining balance:**  After giving 'x' to her sister, Rissa has 1/5 of her initial amount left, meaning she has (1/5) * $15 = $3 left.
* **Solving for x:**  We know Rissa gave away $3, so x = $3.
* **Ronnie's remaining balance:**  Ronnie also gave away $3, leaving her with $5 - $3 = $2.

"The mural's color distribution is a classic geometric problem.  We know the total paint is 12 pints, and half is yellow, which is 6 pints.  Since the red, white, and purple paints are equal, we can calculate the amount of each color by dividing the total paint by 4.  This gives us 12 pints / 4 = 3 pints per color.  Therefore, the red paint used is 3 pints * 1 = 3 pints.

"The teacher has approximately 0.44 times the chalk remaining after using 45% of the chalk on Monday.  To determine how many days he can use the chalk, we need to consider the daily usage rate.  

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can calculate the number of days the chalk will last by dividing the remaining chalk by the daily usage rate. 

The teacher can use the chalk for approximately 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"The problem presents a classic physics scenario involving Newton's apple-throwing antics.  Let's break it down:

* **Initial Apples:**  We start with two apples falling from the tree.
* **First Throw:**  The initial throw of one apple back into the tree causes a cascade effect, resulting in 5 more apples falling.
* **Second Throw:**  The subsequent throw of the remaining apple causes another 6 apples to fall.

The key here is to consider the apples that are picked up and the apples that are thrown.  The number of apples that are picked up is not directly related to the number of apples that are thrown. 

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brings home is the number of apples that were picked up after the initial throws.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs, we need to consider the number of slices consumed and the number of slices per pizza. 

* **Cheese Pizza:** Kate consumes 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 cheese slices.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** Kate consumes 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 pepperoni slices.
* **Total Slices:** Kate consumes 36 cheese slices + 24 pepperoni slices = 60 slices.
* **Cheese Pizza Required:** 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 cheese pizzas.
* **Pepperoni Pizza Required:** 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas. 

Since you can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas. 


**Answer:** 6 cheese pizzas, 8 pepperoni pizzas.

"The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day, and then ordered one bulk pack, which is 50 bandages.  On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.  They used half a pack, which is 100 / 2 = 50 bandages.  The total bandages used is 38 + 28 + 50 = 116 bandages.  They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they started with 194 bandages.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removed, we need to consider the duration of each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters** 


Therefore, the total water removed by the dehumidifier is **30 liters**.

"The problem involves calculating the volume of the jelly beans and then comparing it to the actual volume.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the jelly beans.  The volume of a cube is calculated by side * side * height.  The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall, so the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.  

Next, we need to calculate the volume of the jelly beans.  The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning that 80% of the space in the jar is actually filled with jelly beans.  The volume of the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Finally, we can calculate the number of jelly beans.  The volume of the jelly beans is 432 cubic inches, and each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.  Therefore, the number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880.

The question asks how far off Tim's estimate was.  Tim's estimate was 2880 jelly beans, and the actual number is 900.  The difference between the two is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

"The board is 40 feet long, and we need to determine the length of the longer piece.  

Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4x.  The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we have the equation: x + 4x = 40.  Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.  Therefore, the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Carly's problem can be represented as a system of equations:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies.

We know:

*  b = 3c - 2 
*  The total number of treats is 10, and each person gets 2.

To solve for 'c', we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equation:**  The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies: c + b = 10
2. **Substitute the expression for 'b':**  c + (3c - 2) = 10
3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':** 4c - 2 = 10
                                          4c = 12
                                          c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To determine the number of novels she has written this year, we can use the concept of proportions.  Since 3/4 of her novels this year represent the 9 novels she wrote last year, we can set up a proportion:

where 'x' represents the number of novels Regina wrote this year.

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 9 * (4/3) = 12 novels

Therefore, Regina has written **12** novels this year.

**Total Questions Needed = (70% * 40 questions) / 100 = 28 questions**

"The problem states that Mary makes a certain number of strawberry cubes and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We can represent this mathematically as:

* Strawberry cubes: x
* Blueberry cubes: 5x - 4

The total number of ice cubes is 116.  Therefore:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

6x = 120
x = 20

This means Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  To find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the formula:

Blueberry cubes: 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

**Answer: 96**

"The cost to acquire the necessary popsicle sticks for Bob's project is determined by the number of boxes required and the cost per box.  

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of boxes needed to acquire 56 popsicle sticks.  Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can divide the total popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box: 56 popsicle sticks / 8 sticks per box = 7 boxes.

The cost of the popsicle sticks is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box: 7 boxes * $2.00 per box = $14.00.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider the following:

* **Words per minute (WPM):** John's initial WPM is 150. After training, his WPM is 2.5 times faster, meaning his new WPM is 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM.
* **Words per page:** Each page contains 450 words.
* **Total words:**  We need to speak 10 pages, so the total words are 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words.

Now, we can calculate the time using the formula:

Time = Total words / WPM

Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

**Therefore, it will take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.**

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn kernel popping pattern.  The initial burst of popping is due to the rapid heating of the kernels, which causes the moisture inside to expand rapidly.  The rate of popping is directly proportional to the temperature of the kernels.  

Here's a breakdown of the popping process:

* **Initial Popping:** 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
* **Second Burst:** The next 30 seconds see a three-fold increase in popping rate, with 60 kernels popping.
* **Third Burst:** The rate increases again, with 240 kernels popping in the next 30 seconds.
* **Final Burst:** The final 30 seconds see a reduction in the popping rate, with 120 kernels popping.
* **Residual Heat:**  The kernels that have not popped yet will continue to pop for a short period of time due to residual heat.

The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels. 

**Therefore, Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.**

"To determine the number of lemons needed for Tim's extra gallon of lemonade, we need to consider the juice yield per lemon.  

A standard lemon yields approximately 1/6 of a cup of juice.  

Since Tim needs 8 cups of juice for the extra gallon, we can calculate the number of lemons required:

8 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 48 lemons. 

Therefore, Tim will need 48 lemons.

"The boat's value depreciates linearly, so we can calculate the depreciation for each year.  

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"Helen's trip to Germany involved a hotel stay and bus transportation.  The hotel cost $80 per night, and each bus trip was 10% of the cost of a single night at the hotel.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips. 

* **Hotel Cost:**  The hotel cost $80 per night for three nights, totaling $80 * 3 = $240.
* **Bus Cost:**  Each bus trip cost 10% of the hotel cost, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.  The total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is $240 + $56 = $296.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"The profit margin on each jar is calculated by subtracting the cost of ingredients from the selling price.  

* **Cost per jar:** $44 (calculated above)
* **Selling price per jar:** $50

Therefore, the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

To determine the total profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars: $6 * 10 = $60.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

*  The total number of animals is 20:  c + w = 20
*  The total number of legs is 70: 2c + 4w = 70

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
*  c = 20 - w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
*  2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
*  40 - 2w + 4w = 70
*  2w = 30
*  w = 15

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
*  c = 20 - 15
*  c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
