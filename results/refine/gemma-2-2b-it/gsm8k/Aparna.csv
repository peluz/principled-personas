Let's break down the sales:

* **Green House:**  She sold 1/3 of her total vacuum cleaners.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more than the green house, so she sold 5/3 + 2 = 5/3 + 6/3 = 11/3 vacuum cleaners.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, meaning she sold 1/2 * (5 - 5/3 - 11/3) = 1/2 * (5 - 16/3) = 1/2 * (5/3) = 5/6 vacuum cleaners.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is 1/3 + 5/3 + 5/6 = 1 + 5/3 + 5/6 = 1 + 10/6 + 5/6 = 1 + 15/6 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5.

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162.  

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Let's break down the problem. We know Katy's coffee recipe uses a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water.  We're given that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar.

To find out how many cups of water she used, we can use the ratio to find the value of one part of the ratio. 

*  Since the ratio is 7:13, we need to find the value of one part of the ratio. 
*  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
*  Let's represent the value of one part of the ratio as 'x'. 
*  We can set up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons

"The hive's population is structured in a specific ratio.  We know there are 700 bees in total.  Let's break down the relationship between the bee types:

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is a fundamental factor in the hive's structure.
* **Baby Bees:**  The number of baby bees (b) is directly related to the number of queens.
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are the most numerous group, and their number is directly proportional to the number of baby bees.

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2b**

We can also express this relationship in terms of the number of queens:

**b = 2q**

**Therefore, to find the number of worker bees, we need to find the number of baby bees and then use the equation w = 2b.**

**To find the number of baby bees, we can use the relationship b = 2q and substitute the value of q:**

**b = 2 * 100 = 200**

**Now, we can find the number of worker bees using the equation w = 2b:**

**w = 2 * 200 = 400**

**Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.  
* In two years, their ages will sum to 28.

Let's use variables to represent their current ages:

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

* S = 2B  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

**Solving for Seth's age:**

1. Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. Combine like terms:
   3B + 2 = 28

3. Subtract 2 from both sides:
   3B = 26

4. Divide both sides by 3:
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. Now that we know Brooke's age (B), we can find Seth's age:
   S = 2 * B
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"Zaid has a monthly income of $6000.  Let's break down his expenses:

* **Rent:** $6000 * (1/4) = $1500
* **Car Fuel:** $6000 * (1/3) = $2000
* **Total Expenses:** $1500 + $2000 = $3500

After covering these expenses, he has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He then donates half of this remaining amount to charity, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.

After the donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

Finally, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife for groceries and household goods. This leaves him with $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for the unknown number of chickens.  Let's break it down:

* **Eggs per day:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Chicken ratio:** The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve for the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.
   * We know: r + w = total chickens
   * We know: 3r + 5w = total eggs

2. **Express 'r' in terms of 'w':**
   * The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write: r = w + 2

3. **Substitute 'r' into the first equation:**
   * 3(w + 2) + 5w = total eggs

4. **Solve for 'w':**
   * 3w + 6 + 5w = total eggs
   * 8w + 6 = total eggs
   * 8w = total eggs - 6
   * w = (total eggs - 6) / 8

5. **Substitute 'w' back into the equation r = w + 2:**
   * r = (total eggs - 6) / 8 + 2

**However, there is a problem with the problem statement.  The number of eggs produced by the chickens cannot be a fraction.  Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.**

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the park.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.  To find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

The distance is the perimeter, which is 15 miles.  The speed is 3 miles per hour.  Therefore:

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, the average age of the three in three years is (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

* **Billy's Fries:** Billy took twice the number of fries Kyle took, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
* **Colby's Fries:** Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
* **Griffin's Remaining Fries:** Griffin started with 24 fries and lost 5 (Kyle) + 10 (Billy) + 2 (Colby) = 17 fries.
* **Ginger's Contribution:** Griffin had 27 fries after Colby's removal, meaning Ginger gave him 27 - 2 = 25 fries.

**Answer:** Ginger gave Griffin 25 fries.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to calculate the total number of spots for each snake species. 

* Cobras have 70 spots each, and there are 40 cobras in the park. Therefore, the total number of spots for cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
* Mambas have 35 spots each, and there are 60 mambas in the park. The total number of spots for mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Finally, to find the total number of spots for all snakes, we add the number of spots for cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

"Job B offers a higher net pay compared to Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:**
    * Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
    * Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
    * Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.**

* **The size of the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 3 times the number of students in the equal groups.**

* **Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 200**

* **Solving for 'x', we get: x = 200/3 = 66.67**

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to adjust our assumption.  The problem is likely designed to be solved with a slight error in the wording.  Let's assume the problem meant to say that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, and that the total number of students in the class is 200.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 200.  The number of students in the two equal groups is 200/2 = 100.**

* **The size of the smallest group is 100 - 10 = 90.**

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms:
* 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):
* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  We need to figure out how many friends she can invite to stay within her budget. 
* **Go-karts:**  We need to figure out how many rides she can afford.

**Let's solve for the number of friends:**

* $5 * number of friends + $10 * number of rides = $90

**To find the number of friends, we need to find the value of 'number of friends' that makes the equation true.**

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles. 

To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval:

Number of days = Total distance traveled / Service interval

Number of days = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.375 service intervals. 

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog bed type and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

Similarly, for the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing in total.

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"To determine the initial number of Pokemon cards Kenny had, we need to consider his earnings and the cost of the amusement park ticket. 

We know he wants to sell his cards for $1.5 each and needs to earn $100 to cover the ticket.  Let's represent the number of cards he has as 'x'.  

The total earnings from selling the cards would be 1.5x.  We know that 1.5x must equal the cost of the ticket, which is $100.  

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1.5x = $100

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = $100 / 1.5 
x = 66.67

Since we need to work with whole numbers, we round this value to the nearest whole number.  Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost the same, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other. 

Let's break down the costs for each venue:

* **Venue 1:**  The flat fee is $200, and the cost per guest is $5.  The total cost is calculated as $200 + $5 * number of guests.
* **Venue 2:** The cost per guest is $25. The total cost is calculated as $25 * number of guests.

Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get:

$200 + $5 * number of guests = $25 * number of guests

To solve for the number of guests, we can simplify the equation:

$200 = $20 * number of guests

Dividing both sides by $20, we find:

number of guests = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are needed for the two venues to have the same cost.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = (Number of strawberry gum packs) * (Price per pack)

We know the total cost is $7 and the number of strawberry gum packs is 2.  We can solve for the price per pack:

$7 = 2 * Price per pack

Price per pack = $7 / 2 = $3.50

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.50.

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  To find the total number of animals at the farm and zoo, we add the number of animals on each farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals at the farm and zoo is 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Ratio:**  We know Rose bought 4 times the amount of onions and potatoes Sophia did. This means the ratio of Rose's purchases to Sophia's purchases is 4:1.
* **Finding Sophia's Purchases:**  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find Sophia's purchases, we can use the ratio.  Since Rose's purchases are 4 times Sophia's, we can set up a proportion: 
   *  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
   *  Rose's onions: 12 = 4 * x 
   *  Solving for x, we get x = 12 / 4 = 3 onions.
* **Calculating Sophia's Potatoes:**  We can use the same ratio to find Sophia's potatoes.
   *  Rose's potatoes: 4
   *  Sophia's potatoes: 1
   *  Therefore, Sophia bought 1 potato.

**Answer:** Sophia bought a total of 3 onions and 1 potato.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.  The key is understanding the relationship between the different colors.  

* **Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**  
* **The number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans:**  This means we can represent the number of red jelly beans as 0.99b.
* **The number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans:** This means we can represent the number of green jelly beans as 1.01b.

To find the number of jelly beans in each color, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:

Difference = 1515 - 1495 = 20

**Answer: The jar contains 20 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.**

"To find the average typing speed, we need to consider all three measurements.  

Here's how to calculate the average:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total speed.**
   * Jared's initial speed: 47 WPM
   * Speed after the first increase: 52 WPM
   * Speed after the second increase: 57 WPM
   * Total speed: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM

* **Step 2: Calculate the average speed.**
   * Average speed = Total speed / Number of measurements
   * Average speed = 156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM

**Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.**

"George needs to pay for dental work, and he's looking at two implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000, and he's considering a porcelain crown for one of them, which adds an extra $500.  

To determine how many hours he needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the implants and then figure out how much he needs to earn.

* **Total cost of implants:** 2 implants * $2000/implant = $4000
* **Cost of the crown:** $500
* **Total cost of the implants with crown:** $4000 + $500 = $4500
* **Money George needs to earn:** $4500 - $600 (deposit) = $3900

To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we can use his hourly wage:

* **Hours needed to work:** $3900 / $15/hour = 260 hours

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

* Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
* The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"To determine the total chocolate pounds produced by Ruiz and Marissa, we need to consider their individual production rates and the total working hours. 

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz produces 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. This translates to a production rate of 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's production:** Marissa produces 3/4 times Ruiz's production, meaning she produces (3/4) * 120 pounds = 90 pounds per hour.

**Combined production:**  Over 12 hours, Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa produces 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds.  

Therefore, their combined production is 720 pounds + 1080 pounds = 1800 pounds.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  So, we can write the equation: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This means s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' using either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to consider the relationships between the three individuals' card collections. 

Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.**
* **Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.**
* **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.**

We know the total number of cards is 341.  Therefore:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:

"Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can work our way up the chain:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. Therefore, Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.  Therefore, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  Therefore, Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We need to find Peter's age.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
    * Let Paul's age be represented by ""P + 10"" (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be represented by ""J""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine the average total distance spat, we need to consider the total distance of all seeds spit by both contestants. 

Zoey's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds she spits (40) by the distance per seed (10 feet), resulting in 400 feet.  Similarly, Sydney's total distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds she spits (35) by the distance per seed (12 feet), resulting in 420 feet.

The total distance spat is the sum of these two distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

The average distance is then calculated by dividing the total distance by the number of contestants, which is 2. Therefore, the average distance spat is 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"Cameron would save 460 pesos. 

Here's why:

* The hotel offers two pricing options: a standard 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos and a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos.
* Since Cameron stays for 12 hours, he would have already paid the 1000 pesos for the standard stay.
* He chooses to add 70 pesos per hour for the remaining hours. 
* The cost of the additional hours is 70 pesos/hour * 2 hours = 140 pesos.
* The total cost of his stay is 1000 pesos + 140 pesos = 1140 pesos. 
* Therefore, Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1140 pesos = 460 pesos.

* **Sheep:** Each sheep requires 7 pounds of hay (twice the goat's need minus 3 pounds). We have 12 sheep, so the total hay needed from sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.
* **Total Hay:** The total hay needed is the sum of the hay needed from goats and sheep: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to use the given information and the relationships between the team members' points. 

Let's break it down:

* **Let D represent Dinar's score.**
* **Let A represent Azibo's score.**
* **Let B represent Bahati's score.**

We know:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

We can use these equations to solve for A. 

**Solving for A:**

1. Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
   * D + 10 = A + 20
   * A = D - 10

2. Substitute this value of A into the total points equation:
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

3. Simplify and solve for D:
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

4. Now, substitute the value of D back into the equation A = D - 10:
   * A = 11.67 - 10
   * A = 1.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"Let's break down the problem to find out how many Pokemon Stan caught.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

To solve for Stan's catch, we need to find the value of W (Adelwolfe's catch).  We can do this by substituting the first two equations into the third equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339
2S + W = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:
2(4W - 13) + W = 339
8W - 26 + W = 339
9W - 26 = 339
9W = 365
W = 40.56

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we'll round this to 41.

Now, we can find Stan's catch by substituting the value of W back into the second equation:
S = 4(41) - 13
S = 164 - 13
S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the cost of filling Pat's flower bed, we need to consider the following:

* **Plant Spacing:**  Pat wants to plant her flowers 1.5 feet apart, meaning she needs to account for this spacing when calculating the total number of plants.
* **Total Area:**  The flower bed is 111 feet long, which is equal to 1332 inches. 
* **Cost per Plant:** Each plant costs $6.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the total number of plants:** 
   *  Divide the total length of the flower bed (1332 inches) by the spacing between plants (1.5 feet): 1332 inches / 1.5 feet/plant = 888 plants.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   * Multiply the number of plants (888) by the cost per plant ($6): 888 plants * $6/plant = $5328.

**Therefore, Pat will need to spend $5328 to fill her flower bed.**

"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to express the size of an adult's slice in terms of the size of a kid's slice. 

Let's assume each kid's slice is represented by 'x'.  An adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, so it's 2x.

The total slices are 6, representing the 2 adults and 4 kids.  

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can calculate:

(2x / 6) * 100%

This simplifies to:

(x/3) * 100%

**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/3) * 100%.**

"The population of porcupines in the park will increase by 120 babies per year.  To calculate the total population after a year, we need to consider the initial population and the number of births. 

The initial population is 50 porcupines.  The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines.

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies per month.  Therefore, the total number of babies born in a year is 30 female porcupines * 4 babies/month = 120 babies.

The total population after a year will be 50 + 120 = 170 porcupines.

"Let's break down the power bank's charge over time:

* **Initial Charge:**  We need to determine the initial charge of the power bank.  
* **First 5 Hours:** The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, resulting in a 45% charge remaining.
* **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank then lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, leading to a 34% charge remaining.

**To find the initial charge, we can use the following logic:**

* The power bank lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours.
* The power bank lost 21% of its charge in the next 3 hours.
* The power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.

**Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 75%.**

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the required down payment savings. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

* Hourly wage: $10
* Hourly tips: $15
* Total weekly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we need to determine her weekly savings:

* Total weekly earnings: $25
* Savings per week: $25 * 0.20 = $5

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks to reach her savings goal:

* Total savings needed: $10000
* Weekly savings: $5
* Number of weeks: $10000 / $5 = 2000 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for **2000** weeks to save the down payment.

"The price of carrots increases by 5% each year, so to calculate the price after three years, we need to consider the price increase for each year. 

* **Year 1:** The price of carrots is $120.  A 5% increase on $120 is $6.  The price after the first year is $120 + $6 = $126.
* **Year 2:** The price of carrots is now $126. A 5% increase on $126 is $6.30. The price after the second year is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.
* **Year 3:** The price of carrots is now $132.30. A 5% increase on $132.30 is $6.62. The price after the third year is $132.30 + $6.62 = $138.92.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is approximately $139.

"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them into 8 albums.  To determine the number of selfies and portraits, we need to consider the following:

* **Albums without selfies or portraits:** 8 albums - 3 albums (selfies) - 2 albums (portraits) = 3 albums
* **Pictures per album:** 72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album
* **Selfies:** 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies
* **Portraits:** 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits

Therefore, Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 


**Answer:**

"James reads 18 pages at a rate of 3 pages per 10 minutes.  To find the total time spent reading, we can calculate:

* **Time per page:** 10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page (approximately)

"The hotel had 100 guests initially.  24 guests checked out early and 15 guests checked out late.  In the afternoon, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 30 guests.  7 more guests checked in after dinner.  

To calculate the total number of guests, we need to consider the initial number of guests, the number of guests who checked out early and late, and the number of guests who checked in after dinner.

* **Total guests after early checkouts:** 100 - 24 - 15 = 61
* **Total guests after late checkouts:** 61 + 30 + 7 = 98
* **Total guests now:** 98

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.
* Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.

To find the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent Donovan's portion time.
*  Betsy's portion time is 'x + 18'.

Therefore:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

* 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Now, we can find Betsy's portion time:

* Betsy's portion time = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  
* We can represent this as 2x, where x is the number of eggs each of them painted.
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  
*  We can represent this as 2y, where y is the number of eggs Sarah painted.
*  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so we can represent this as y + 12.

**Let's solve for the number of eggs each person painted:**

*  We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.  
*  We can set up an equation: 2x + 2y = 56
*  We also know that y = 22 - x. 
*  Substitute this value of y into the equation: 2x + 2(22 - x) = 56
*  Simplify and solve for x: 2x + 44 - 2x = 56
*  This simplifies to 44 = 56, which is not possible. 

**Therefore, there is an error in the given information.  The total number of eggs painted cannot be 56.**

"To determine the number of seashells each person receives, we need to first determine the number of seashells each person collected. 

* **Carlos:**  We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than Carlos's collection. Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
* **Carrey:**  Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.
* **Total Seashells:**  The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.
* **Equally Divided:**  To find out how many seashells each person receives, we divide the total number of seashells by the number of people: 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can set up an equation to solve for the length of the yellow rope:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  To find the length of the red rope, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

* **Rissa's remaining amount:** After giving to her sister, Rissa had $15 - $3 = $12.
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** Ronnie had $5.
* **Amount given to sister:**  Ronnie gave away the same amount as Rissa, so she gave away $3.

"Colin is currently 12.5 years old. 

**Explanation:**

We can solve this problem using a system of equations. Let's represent Colin's current age as 'C' and Wendy's current age as 'W'.  

* **Equation 1:** W = 5(C + 7) represents Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age.
* **Equation 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) represents Colin's age in 25 years.

We can solve for 'C' by substituting the value of 'W' from Equation 1 into Equation 2. 

Let's substitute W = 5(C + 7) into Equation 2:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Simplifying the equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
(2/3)C = -5
C = -5 * (3/2)
C = -15/2

Since age cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach.  Let's revisit the initial equations and see if we can find a different solution.

"Pauline's annual museum visits have experienced a price increase.  The cost per visit has increased by 150%, which means the new cost is $5.  

Over a 5-year period, Pauline visits the museum 15 times.  Over the next 3 years, she continues to visit 9 times.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the initial cost and the cost increase. 

* **Initial cost:** 15 visits * $2/visit = $30
* **Cost increase:** 15 visits * $2/visit * 0.15 = $4.50
* **Total cost:** $30 + $4.50 = $34.50

Over the next 3 years, Pauline visits the museum 9 times at a cost of $5/visit, totaling $45.

"The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  To find the length of the longer piece, we need to determine the value of the shorter piece. 

Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40 feet.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40 feet.  

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x = 8 feet.

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Let's analyze the problem:

We know that Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class.  We can represent the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'.  The problem states that the number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2.  

We also know that each person in the class gets 2 treats.  The total number of treats is 10.

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

We can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying the equation:

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To find the number of novels she wrote this year, we can use the concept of proportions.  Since 3/4 of her novels this year represent the 9 novels she wrote last year, we can set up a proportion:

(3/4) * x = 9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

x = (9 * 4) / 3

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 

**Answer:** 12

"Bud's macaroni and cheese expenses can be calculated as follows:

* **Cost per week:**  The cost of pasta is $1.00, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount for gruyere cheese, totaling $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.
* **Total weekly cost:** The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
* **Yearly cost:**  Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in a year he makes 52 weeks * $9.00/week = $468.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"The custodian needs to clean 80 classrooms over 5 days, which equates to 1600 minutes of cleaning time (80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom).  

To determine the percentage of their workday dedicated to cleaning, we need to consider the total work hours.  The custodian works 8 hours per day, which is 480 minutes.

The percentage of time spent cleaning is calculated as follows:

(Cleaning time / Total work time) * 100%

(1600 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 33.33%

Therefore, the custodian spends approximately 33.33% of their workday cleaning classrooms.

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between strawberry and blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  Therefore:

* x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

* 6x = 120
* x = 20

This means Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.  

The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as:

* 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

Therefore, Mary made **96** blueberry cubes.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his word-per-minute (WPM) speed and the number of words per page. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **John's WPM:** 150 WPM
* **John's new WPM:** 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new WPM is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM
* **Words per page:** 450 words
* **Total words:** 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time in minutes:

* **Time = Total words / Speed**
* **Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes**


Therefore, it would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages.

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn popping pattern.  Here's a breakdown of the popping process:

* **Initial Popping:** The first 30 seconds see a consistent rate of 20 kernels popping per 30 seconds.
* **Increased Popping:** The next 30 seconds see a three-fold increase in popping rate, with 60 kernels popping.
* **Further Increase:** The following 30 seconds see a four-fold increase, resulting in 240 kernels popping.
* **Final Popping:** The final 30 seconds see a reduction in popping rate, with 120 kernels popping.
* **Residual Heat:**  The kernels that remain in the pan after the heat is turned off will continue to pop for a short period due to residual heat. 

**Therefore, the total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels.** 

**The number of kernels that pop from residual heat is 120 kernels / 4 = 30 kernels.**

* **Lemons for the extra gallon:**  The extra gallon needs twice the tartness, so he needs 4 cups * 2 = 8 cups of juice.
* **Lemons for the extra gallon:**  To get 8 cups of juice, he needs 8 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 48 lemons.

* Red candies: 54
* Orange candies: 54 * 2 = 108
* Yellow candies: 54 / 2 = 27

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

"Helen's trip to Germany involved a hotel stay and bus transportation.  The hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for three nights.  Each bus trip cost 10% of the cost of a single night at the hotel.  

To calculate the total cost of the bus trips, we need to determine the cost of one bus trip.  The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of a single night at the hotel, which is $80.  

The total cost of the bus trips is the number of trips multiplied by the cost of each trip.  She rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost of the bus trips is $8 * 7 = $56.

The total cost of the hotel is $80 * 3 = $240.

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is $240 + $56 = $296.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to consider his total funds after completing his chores and buying ice cream. 

* **Chore Earnings:** Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores, and he completed chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.

"Igor's error in item count suggests a potential issue with the way he organized the items.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Test Tubes:** Igor gathered 8 test tubes, which is half the requested 16. This indicates a potential error in counting.
* **Petri Dishes:** He gathered 16 Petri dishes, which is the requested number.
* **Beakers:**  The total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.  We can use this information to determine the number of beakers.

**To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to consider the following:**

* **Total Items:** 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) = 24
* **Beakers:** 29 (total items) - 24 (items counted) = 5

**Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"Vanessa completed her part of the race in **4 minutes**. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Relative Speeds:**  We know Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, meaning her speed is directly proportional to the distance she covers.
* **Time and Distance Relationship:**  The time taken to complete a distance is inversely proportional to the speed.  
* **Calculation:**  Since Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 2 miles, we can use the relationship between time and distance to find Vanessa's time.

"The vendor made a 25% profit on each watermelon, meaning the selling price was 125% of the cost price.  

To find the selling price per watermelon, we can use the following formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price * (1 + Profit Percentage)

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is:

$80 (Cost Price) * (1 + 0.25) = $100

"Let's break down the problem:

* **James's age:** James is twice Dora's age, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  Therefore, James is currently 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
* **John's age:**  We know James was born when John was 19.  Therefore, John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **The youngest son's age:** The youngest son was born when John was 32.  In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

"To determine the difference in oranges peeled, we need to consider the rate at which each person peels oranges. 

* Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes.
* Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes.

Since they are peeling oranges simultaneously, the number of oranges peeled is directly proportional to the time spent peeling. 

Therefore, after an hour (60 minutes), both Ana and Jane will have peeled the same number of oranges.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
