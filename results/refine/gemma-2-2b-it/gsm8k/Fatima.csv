"A robe requires a specific ratio of blue and white fibers.  To determine the total number of bolts needed, we can calculate the amount of each fiber and then add them together. 

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, and since the ratio of white fiber is half that of blue fiber, it requires 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  

Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  To determine the number of gold coins, we need to consider the relationship between silver and gold coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent this relationship with the following equation:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**

To find the number of silver coins, we can use the total number of coins:

* **Total coins = Silver coins + Gold coins**
* **110 = Silver coins + (Silver coins + 30)**

Simplifying the equation:

* **110 = 2 * Silver coins + 30**
* **80 = 2 * Silver coins**
* **Silver coins = 40**

Now, we can calculate the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**
* **Gold coins = 40 + 30**
* **Gold coins = 70**

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins. 


"
"Raymond has 40 jewels.  To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to consider the relationship between Siobhan, Aaron, and Raymond's jewels.  

* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, which is 20 jewels. 
* Therefore, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
* Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes of his ping pong match.  In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes.  To calculate the total points, we need to determine the increase in points and then add it to his initial score. 

The increase in points is 20 minutes * 0.25 = 5 points.  

Therefore, Mike scored 4 points + 5 points = 9 points in the second 20 minutes.

His total score is 4 points + 9 points = 13 points.

* **Walking:**  We know her walking speed is 3 miles per hour. 
* **Running Time:**  She runs for 2 hours.
* **Walking Time:** She walks for 4 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to consider both her running and walking times. 

**Total Distance = Distance Running + Distance Walking**

**Distance Running:** 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
**Distance Walking:** 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

**Total Distance = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles**

"Marcy's pension is a complex calculation.  Here's how to break it down:

* **Years of service:** Marcy has worked for 40 years.
* **Initial Pension:**  She receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.
* **Tiered Pension:** After 20 years, her pension is calculated as 5% of the total pension earned over the first 20 years. 

To calculate the total pension earned over the first 20 years, we use the formula:

* Total Pension = Annual Pension * Number of Years
* Total Pension = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, to calculate the total pension earned after 30 years, we need to consider the tiered pension. 

* **Tiered Pension:**  The tiered pension is calculated as 5% of the total pension earned over the first 20 years.

The service then applies a 10% discount on the second half of the year, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14.  

Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is $140 - $14 = $126.

The total cost for the year is $840 + $126 = $966.

"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can use the given information:

* Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
* Their combined sales are 88,000 copies.

Let 'x' represent the number of copies Harald sold.  Since Marilyn sold 10x copies, we can set up the equation:

* We know Henry baked a total of 110 cookies after dropping 5. 
* We also know he baked 2 times the amount he baked last year.
* This means we need to find the number of cookies he baked last year.

Let's use the following equation:

"Katy's coffee recipe uses a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water.  To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we can use the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:13 represents the proportion of sugar to water in the recipe.

2. **Finding the Unit Value:**  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find the value of one part of the ratio, we can set up a proportion:

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.  
* In two years, their ages will sum to 28.

Let's use variables to represent their ages:

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

* S = 2B  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* (2B) + B + 2 = 28

Simplify the equation:

* 3B + 2 = 28

Solve for B:

* 3B = 26
* B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

* **Less well-rounded team:** The time for each runner is 60 seconds, 63 seconds, 66 seconds, and 69 seconds.  
* **Faster team:** The faster team's time is calculated by multiplying the time of each runner by 4. 

The difference in time is 258 seconds - 220 seconds = 38 seconds.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used with the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:** 10 cages of hamsters are given 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rats:** We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total, and 50 pieces were used with hamsters.  Therefore, 160 - 50 = 110 pieces were used for the rats.
* **Rats per cage:**  We divide the total straw used for rats (110) by the number of rats (18.33) to find the number of rats per cage. 

**Answer:**  Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, there are **6** rats in each cage.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for the unknown number of chickens.  Let's break it down:

* **Eggs per day:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **The key:**  The problem states that there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve for the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.
   * We know: r + w = total chickens
   * We know: 3r + 5w = total eggs

2. **Use the given information to create a system of equations:**
   * We know that r = w + 2 (two more white chickens than red)

3. **Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**
   * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 
      * 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
   * Simplify and solve for 'w':
      * 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
      * 8w + 6 = 42
      * 8w = 36
      * w = 4.5 

4. **The problem:**  We cannot have half a chicken. This means there is an error in the problem statement. 


**Answer:** The problem as stated is not solvable.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, the average age of the three in three years is (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to calculate the total number of spots for each snake species. 

* Cobras have 70 spots each, and there are 40 cobras in the park. Therefore, the total number of spots for cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
* Mambas have 35 spots each, and there are 60 mambas in the park. The total number of spots for mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Finally, to find the total number of spots for all snakes, we add the number of spots for cobras and mambas: 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"To determine the number of 5-star rows, we need to consider the total number of stars and the number of stars in each row. 

* The flag has 76 stars in total.
* The first two rows have 8 stars each, totaling 3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars.
* The remaining stars are in the third row. 
* The third row has 76 total stars - 24 stars = 52 stars.
* The number of 5-star rows is 52 stars - 24 stars = 28 stars.
* We need to divide the total number of 5-star stars by the number of stars per row to find the number of rows. 
* 28 stars / 5 stars/row = 5.6 rows. 
* Since you can't have a fraction of a row, there are **5** rows of 5 stars.

"To transport 80 flagstones, we need to determine the number of trucks required.  Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and the total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  

To calculate the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:

5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks

Since we can't have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we will need **3 trucks** to transport all the flagstones.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  

Therefore, we can solve for 't':

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Divide both sides by 30 miles/hour:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business suits, suitcases, and a flight ticket.  

To determine how much he can spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items first. 

* **Business suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150

"Job B offers a higher net pay compared to Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.**

* **The size of the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 3 times the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 200**

* **Solving for 'x', we get: x = 200 / 3 = 66.67**

* **Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to adjust our thinking.**

* **The problem states that the groups are equal, so we can assume that the number of students in each group is a whole number.**

* **Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.**

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms:
* 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):
* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To determine Tyson's total distance for June, we need to consider his daily mileage and the number of training days in June. 

* **Daily Distance:** Tyson runs 5000 meters per day.
* **Increased Distance:** His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, so his new daily distance is 5000 meters + (1/5) * 5000 meters = 6000 meters.
* **Total Distance:**  He trains for 30 days in June.  Therefore, his total distance for June is 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"John spent a total of 15 hours engaging in various activities during his vacation.  He spent 6 hours on boating and 3 hours swimming, totaling 9 hours.  He also watched 6 hours of television shows.  

To determine the time spent on sightseeing, we can calculate the percentage of his time spent on activities other than boating, swimming, and watching television.  

* **Total time spent on activities:** 9 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours
* **Percentage of time spent on activities other than boating, swimming, and watching television:** 15 hours / 15 hours * 100% = 100%
* **Time spent on sightseeing:** 100% - 40% = 60%

Therefore, John spent 60% of his time sightseeing.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  We need to know how many friends she's inviting. Let's call this number ""x"". The cost of mini-golf for all her friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:**  She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is 10 * 2 = $20.

Now, let's add the cost of mini-golf and go-karts to see if it's within her $90 budget:

5x + 20 = 90

To find the number of friends, we need to solve this equation. 

**Answer:** 
* **Option A:** 16

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles. 

To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval:

Number of days = Total distance traveled / Service interval

Number of days = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.375 service intervals.

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

Similarly, for the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"The trip to John's friend's house took approximately 6.00 hours. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Outbound trip:** 
    * Distance: 200 miles
    * Speed: 70 mph
    * Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours
* **Detour:** 
    * Distance: 10 miles
    * Speed: 70 mph
    * Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours
* **Return trip:**
    * Distance: 240 miles
    * Speed: 80 mph
    * Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Total time:** 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

"To determine the total pesos, we need to calculate the total pesos Axel has and the total pesos Anna has. 

* Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
* Anna has twice the amount of silver pesos Axel has, which is 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.
* Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* The total pesos Axel has is 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.
* The total pesos Anna has is 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.
* Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To find the original amount of land he had, we can use the following equation:

*  (1 - 3/5) * x = 12.8 

Where 'x' represents the original amount of land.

Simplifying the equation:

* (2/5) * x = 12.8

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (5/2):

* x = 12.8 * (5/2)

Calculating the result:

* x = 32 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally owned 32 hectares of land.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6.  To find the difference in popsicles between them, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the value of one ratio part:**  The total number of popsicles is 165, and the ratio parts are 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, one ratio part represents 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

2. **Determine Betty's popsicles:** Betty has 5 parts in the ratio, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

3. **Determine Sam's popsicles:** Sam has 6 parts in the ratio, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

4. **Calculate the difference:** Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Mel can save a significant amount of energy by reducing his AC usage.  Here's how to calculate the savings:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:** The AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours daily, resulting in 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours of energy used per day.
* **Reduced Usage:**  He reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, so his daily energy consumption is now 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.
* **Energy Savings:**  The difference in energy consumption is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-Hour Conversion:**  To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, divide by 1000.  Therefore, the total energy saved in kilowatt-hours is 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, Tyson will need 5 sandwiches.  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.  

* **Meat:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
* **Cheese:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00 on meat.

The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00 on cheese.

The total cost for the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Allan has a total of 40 cannolis and twice as many corn as cannolis.  To find the total number of corn and cannolis, we can use the following steps:

* **Calculate the number of corn:** Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he has 60 + 40 = 100 cannolis.
* **Calculate the number of corn:** He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has 100 * 2 = 200 corn.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Elliott walked 5,000 steps to and from school.
* He then took 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend.
* He had 2,000 steps remaining after his jog.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took to and from school and his walk with his friend from the total steps he had left:

Here's the calculation:

* **Cookies per day:** Shannon consumes 2 cookies per night.
* **Total cookies needed:** She needs enough for 30 days, so she needs 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We know Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use the given information about the total number of heads and bumps. 

* **Heads:** The total number of heads is 180.
* **Bumps:** The total number of bumps is 304.

We know that camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.  

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We can set up the following equations:

* **Equation 1:** c + d = 180 (The total number of heads)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"The cost of the streaming service over two years is calculated as follows:

* **Introductory Period:** 6 months at $8/month = $48
* **Standard Rate:** 2 months at $12/month = $24
* **Standard Rate:** 6 months at $14/month = $84

Total cost for the first 8 months: $48 + $24 + $84 = $156

Since the service has a standard rate for the remaining months, we can calculate the cost for the full two years. 

**Therefore, the total cost for two years of the service is $156 * 2 = $312.**

* **Buses:** 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each.
* **Minibuses:** 6 minibuses with a capacity of 30 employees each.
* **Minivans:** 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each.

To calculate the total number of employees, we can add the capacity of each type of vehicle:

"Kenny needs to sell enough Pokemon cards to cover the $100 amusement park ticket.  We know he's selling each card for $1.50.  To figure out how many cards he needs to sell, we can use the following equation:

* **Total Earnings = Price per Card * Number of Cards**

We know the total earnings need to be $100.  Let's represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.

* **1.5x = $100**

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.5:

* **x = $100 / 1.5**
* **x = 66.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Kenny started with approximately **67** cards.

    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

$7 = 2 * Price per pack

Price per pack = $7 / 2 = $3.50

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.50.

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  To find the total number of animals at the farm and zoo, we add the number of animals on each farm: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals at the farm and zoo is 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up an equation:

* Rose's onions: 12
* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.  

To find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the same logic:

* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 3
* Sophia's potatoes: 4 - 3 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 3 onions and 1 potato.

"The problem states that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's break down the relationship between the different colors of jelly beans:

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can represent the number of red jelly beans as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:** There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent the number of green jelly beans as 1.01b.

To find the number of jelly beans in each category, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:

Difference = 1515 - 1495 = 20

**Answer:** The jar contains 20 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000 with an additional $500 for a porcelain crown.  His initial deposit is $600.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.  The cost of the crown is $500.  Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To determine how many hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the remaining amount he needs to pay.  He earns $15 per hour.  The amount he needs to earn is $4500 - $600 = $3900.  

To calculate the number of hours needed, we divide the total amount he needs to earn by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.


**Answer:** 260 hours.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

* Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
* The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  
   * Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  
   * This translates to: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.
   * This means the number of sheep plus the number of geese equals 20.
   * We can express this as: s + g = 20

Now, we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  

**Solving for 's'**

1. **Isolate 'g' in Equation 2:**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

"Let's break down the problem:

*  We know Janey has 3 more books than twice the number Sally has. 
*  We are given that Janey has 21 books.

To find out how many books Sally has, let's use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of books Sally has.
*  Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.
*  Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2x + 3.

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can set up an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

To determine the number of toys needed, we need to consider the total number of dogs in the shelter.  There are 12 dogs in the shelter.  Since each dog requires one toy, James needs 12 * 1 = 12 toys. 

After purchasing the initial 12 toys, James needs to account for any dogs that may have left the shelter.  We are told that 3 dogs left, so he no longer needs the 12 toys.

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to understand the relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns.  

The ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36.  This means that for every 6 potatoes, you can make 36 hash browns.

To find out how many hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Cross-multiplying, we get:

* 6 * x = 36 * 96

Solving for x:

* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"The price of the crate of fruit is determined by the cost of each individual fruit.  

* **Apples:**  One apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  One banana costs twice the price of an apple, so it costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:**  Oranges cost three times the price of a banana, so they cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

The total cost of the crate is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

"Mike's movie collection is a great opportunity to explore the benefits of digital media!  

Here's how we can calculate the cost of replacing his collection:

* **Series movies:**  Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series, meaning he has 600 / 3 = 200 series movies.
* **Movies not in series:**  He has 600 - 200 = 400 movies that are not in series.
* **Cost of older movies:**  40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which cost $5 each.  This means he'll spend 40/100 * 400 = $160 on these.
* **Cost of normal movies:**  The remaining movies are the ones not in series and the ones that are older movies.  He has 400 - 160 = 240 movies that are normal movies.  The cost of these is 240 * $10 = $2400.

**Therefore, the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $2400 + $160 = $2560.**

"The overall pass rate is calculated by adding the pass rates of each grade level and then dividing by the total number of students. 

* Third grade: 340 students passed out of 500 students, giving a pass rate of 0.68 or 68%.
* Fourth grade: 40 students passed out of 100 students, giving a pass rate of 0.40 or 40%.
* Fifth grade: 400 students passed out of 500 students, giving a pass rate of 0.80 or 80%.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    * Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    * Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We can determine this by understanding the relationship between the individuals' lifting abilities and the mountain's height.

* **Pompei:**  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
* **Saskay:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, meaning she can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert Naruto's lifting capacity to feet, we divide his lifting capacity in inches by 12 inches per foot. 

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain **40 feet**.

"To determine the time it takes four turtles to traverse the highway, we need to consider the relationship between the number of turtles, their individual speeds, and the total distance.

The key is to recognize that the distance traveled remains constant regardless of the number of turtles.  

Here's how to solve this:

* **Individual turtle speed:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is x/2.
* **Total time:**  The time taken by the turtles is directly proportional to the total distance and inversely proportional to the combined speed of the turtles. 

Therefore, the time taken by four turtles will be:

"Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.  

Here's how to calculate that:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + rt) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"To determine your age, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's break it down:

* **Your age (x):**  This is the variable we're trying to find.
* **Your brother's age (x + 3):**  He is three years older than you.
* **Your sister's age (x - 2):** She is two years younger than you.

The problem states that the sum of your ages is 87.  This can be represented as:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 1 = 87

Solving for x:

3x = 86
x = 28

Therefore, you are 28 years old.

"To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to consider the total number of cars and the number of each color. 

* We know there are 12 red cars.
* There are 10 green cars, which is 2 fewer than the red cars.
* We also know there are 30 blue cars, which is 3 times the number of green cars.

The total number of cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

"To determine the number of books Fawn has, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as ""F"".  

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  This translates to the following equations:

* Sofie's books: F - 12 + 25
* Anne's books: F - 12

The total number of books is 85.  Therefore:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation:

3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F:

3F = 72
F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the cost of the chickens Isaias purchased, we need to consider the profit he aims to make and the number of chickens he plans to sell. 

* **Profit:** Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** He plans to sell each chicken for $50.
* **Number of Chickens:** He has 300 chickens.

To calculate the cost of the chickens, we can use the following formula:

**Total Revenue = Number of Chickens * Selling Price**

**Total Revenue = 300 chickens * $50/chicken = $15,000**

**Cost of Chickens = Total Revenue - Profit**

**Cost of Chickens = $15,000 - $2,000 = $13,000**

**Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $13,000.**

"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left, we need to know how many meters of the new rope she buys.  

Let's break it down:

* **Selling the rope:** Sarah sells the 20-meter rope for $40.
* **Cost of the new rope:** The new rope costs $1.50 per meter. 
* **Profit:**  The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost of the new rope.

**To find the profit, we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah buys.** 

**Here's how to calculate the profit:**

* **Profit = Selling Price - Cost of New Rope**
* **Profit = $40 - ($1.50/meter * x meters)** 

**Please note:**  The final amount of money Sarah has left depends on the number of meters of the new rope she buys.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age, we can use the following equation:

*  Age in 'x' years = 8 + x
*  We know that in 'x' years, her age will be three times her current age, so: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for 'x':
* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

"Kelly's budget is insufficient to cover the cost of all the items in her cart.  Let's break down the expenses:

* **Bacon:** 5 packs at $10 each = $50
* **Chicken:** 6 packs at $20 each = $120
* **Strawberries:** 3 packs at $4 each = $12

"Elaina's final concert was extended to a duration of 65 minutes, which is double the length of her usual concerts.  To determine the length of her typical concerts, we need to consider the encore performance. 

The encore is 15 minutes long.  Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, which includes the encore.  

To find the length of her usual concerts, we can subtract the encore's runtime from the final concert's runtime: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.


**Answer:** 55 meters per second

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  

* **Let's represent their ages:**
    * Peter's age: P
    * Paul's age: P + 10
    * John's age: J

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * P + (P + 10) + J = 100  (The sum of their ages is 100)
    * P = (P + 10) + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = (P + 10) + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information:

* **Bahati's score:**  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.  
* **Dinar's score:**  We need to find Dinar's score to determine Azibo's.

Let's use the total points equation: A + D + B = 45.

We know:
* B = A + 20
* B = D + 10

Substituting these into the total points equation:
(A + D + (A + 20)) = 45

Simplifying:
2A + D + 20 = 45

We can solve for D:
D = 45 - 2A - 20
D = 25 - 2A

Now, we can substitute this value of D back into the equation for B:
B = A + 20
B = (25 - 2A) + 20
B = 45 - 2A

We know that B = D + 10, so:
45 - 2A = D + 10

Substituting D = 25 - 2A:
45 - 2A = (25 - 2A) + 10

Simplifying:
45 - 2A = 35 - 2A

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 200 occupied beds.  Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted daily.  To determine the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to consider the total number of patients admitted and the current occupancy rate. 

After 2 weeks, the hospital will have a total of 700 patients admitted.  

To calculate the number of unoccupied beds, we can use the following formula:

Unoccupied beds = Total beds - Occupied beds

Unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800

Therefore, the hospital will have 800 unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are trying to catch all the Pokemon.  We can represent the number of Pokemon each has caught with the following variables:

* A = Alex's Pokemon
* S = Stan's Pokemon
* W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon

We can set up equations based on the given information:

* A = S + 5  
* S = 4W - 13
* A + S + W = 339

To find Stan's catch, we need to solve for S.  Let's start by substituting the first two equations into the third equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339
2S + W = 339

Now, we can substitute the second equation into this equation:

2(4W - 13) + W = 339
8W - 26 + W = 339
9W - 26 = 339
9W = 365
W = 40.56

We can now substitute the value of W back into the second equation to find Stan's catch:

S = 4(40.56) - 13
S = 162.24 - 13
S = 149.24

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we round this to 151.

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars per box, we need to know the number of chocolate bars sold per box.  

Let's consider the information given:

* Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
* Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
* Together they sold 64 chocolate bars.

To find the number of chocolate bars per box, we can use the following equation:

Total chocolate bars = Number of boxes * Number of chocolate bars per box

We know the total number of chocolate bars sold (64) and the total number of boxes sold (8).  

Therefore, we can solve for the number of chocolate bars per box:

Number of chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Total number of boxes

Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8 = 8

"The dance studio's monthly earnings are calculated by multiplying the cost per session by the number of sessions per month. 

* **Cost per session:** $25 (studio rental) + ($1.50/student * 10 students) = $25 + $15 = $40
* **Sessions per month:** 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month
* **Total earnings per month:** 12 sessions/month * $40/session = $480

Therefore, the dance studio is expected to earn $480 per month.

"Peter and Martha have a total of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively.  To determine the difference in chocolate bars per box, we can calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for each person. Peter has 64 total chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box contains 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars. Martha has 56 total chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box contains 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.  The difference in chocolate bars per box is 16 - 8 = 8.

"The population of porcupines in the park will increase by 120 babies per year.  To calculate the total number of porcupines after a year, we need to consider the initial population and the number of babies born. 

The initial population is 50 porcupines.  The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30 female porcupines. 

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies per month.  Therefore, the total number of babies born in a year is 30 female porcupines * 4 babies/month = 120 babies per year.

The total number of porcupines after a year will be 50 + 120 = 170 porcupines.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the required down payment savings. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

* Hourly wage: $10
* Hourly tips: $15
* Total weekly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we need to determine her weekly savings:

* Total weekly earnings: $25
* Savings per week: $25 * 0.20 = $5

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks to save the car:

* Total savings needed: $10000
* Weekly savings: $5
* Number of weeks: $10000 / $5 = 2000 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for **2000** weeks to save the down payment.

"To determine the time it takes to recoup the loan and lost income, we need to consider the total amount of money needed to be earned. 

The total amount needed is the sum of the loan payments and the lost income: $200,000 (loan payments) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

To calculate the time to earn this amount, we divide the total amount needed by the annual income after the degree: $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"James's insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  The normal monthly premium is $120.  To calculate his annual premium, we need to consider the increased cost.

The increased cost is 60% of the normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his new monthly premium is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find his annual premium, we multiply his monthly premium by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's represent this as 'x'.
* Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent this as 'y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12'.
*  We also know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.  This can be represented as '2x + (2y + 12) = 56'.

Now, let's solve for 'y' (the number of eggs Sarah painted):

*  We know that 'y = 22 - x'. 
*  Substitute this value of 'y' into the equation '2y + 12 = 56 - 2x'.
*  This gives us: 2(22 - x) + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  Simplify and solve for 'x': 44 - 2x + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  This simplifies to 56 = 56, which is always true.

Now, we can find the number of eggs each person painted. 

*  We know that 'x' represents the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted. 
*  We also know that 'y' represents the number of eggs Sarah painted. 
*  We can use the equation 'y = 22 - x' to find the value of 'y'. 

Let me know if you'd like to continue solving for the number of eggs each person painted.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this mathematically as:

*  Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  This can be represented as:

* Blue rope length = Yellow rope length - 7

We can now express the total length of the three ropes as:

* Yellow rope length + Blue rope length + Red rope length = 37

Substituting the expressions for the lengths of the ropes, we get:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 35 = 37

Solving for x:

* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Therefore, the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use the expression:

* Red rope length = 4 * (Blue rope length)

Substituting the value of the blue rope length:

* Red rope length = 4 * (12 - 7) 
* Red rope length = 4 * 5
* Red rope length = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

"The teacher needs to recycle the chalk after using 2 inches of chalk.  To figure out how many days he has left, we need to consider the amount of chalk he uses each day. 

* **Calculate the chalk used on Monday:** The teacher used 45% of the chalk, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.
* **Calculate the chalk remaining:** Since he used 2.25 times the amount of chalk, he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk he normally uses left.
* **Calculate the number of days:**  He has 0.44 times the amount of chalk left, and he uses 20% each day.  So, he can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  To find the length of the longer piece, we need to know the length of the shorter piece.  

Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Carly is making brownies and cupcakes for her art class.
* We need to find the number of cupcakes she made.

Let's use variables to represent the number of cupcakes and brownies:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies.

We know:

*  b = 3c - 2  (Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes)

We also know:

* Each person gets 2 treats.
* The class has 5 people.

Therefore, the total number of treats is: 5 * 2 = 10

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

Now, substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between the number of strawberry cubes and the number of blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5x - 4.  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Solving for x:
* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. 

The number of blueberry cubes is calculated as 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his speaking speed and the word count per page. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **John's speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)
* **John's new speed:** 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM
* **Words per page:** 450 words
* **Total words:** 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it takes him to speak the total words:

* **Time = Total words / Speed**
* **Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes**

"The popcorn kernels are exhibiting a classic popcorn popping pattern.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Popping:** 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds.
* **Increased Popping:**  The kernels pop three times faster in the next 30 seconds, indicating a rate increase.
* **Further Increase:** The popping rate increases again, four times the initial rate in the next 30 seconds.
* **Final Popping:** The rate slows down to half the previous rate in the final 30 seconds.
* **Residual Heat:**  A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds will continue to pop from residual heat.

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to calculate the total kernels popped in each stage and then add them up. 

**Answer:** 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels. 

The kernels that pop from residual heat will be 30 kernels.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to consider his total funds after completing his chores and buying ice cream. 

* **Chore Earnings:** Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores, and he completed chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.
* **Ice Cream Cost:**  He spent $1.25 per ice cream cone and bought 3 cones for himself and 3 friends, so the total cost is $1.25 * 3 = $3.75.
* **Total Funds:**  After his chores and ice cream, Ryan has $18 + $3.75 = $21.75.
* **Movie Tickets:**  Tickets cost $6.50 each, so Ryan can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.33 tickets. 

Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy **3** movie tickets.

"To determine the number of weeks to fill the holes, we need to consider the rate at which Nate fills the holes and the rate at which the dog digs. 

* **Filling rate:** Nate fills 9 holes per day.
* **Digging rate:** The dog digs 6 holes per night.

To find the total number of holes filled, we need to consider the number of days Nate is filling the holes. 

* **Total holes filled:** 126 holes.

To find the number of weeks to fill the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day. 

* **Weeks to fill:** 126 holes / 9 holes/day = 14 days. 

Therefore, it takes Nate **14 days** to fill all the holes.

"Igor gathered 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and a total of 29 items on the lab bench.  To determine the number of beakers Igor lost, we can use the following equation:

Total items = Test tubes + Petri dishes + Beakers

We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + Beakers = 29

Solving for the number of beakers:

Beakers = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5

Therefore, Igor lost **5** beakers.

"To determine the difference in oranges peeled, we need to consider the rate at which each person peels oranges. 

* Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes.
* Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes.

Since we are comparing the number of oranges peeled after an hour, we need to calculate the total number of oranges peeled by each person in an hour.

* Ana peels 1 orange/minute * 60 minutes = 60 oranges.
* Jane peels 1 orange/minute * 60 minutes = 60 oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, both Ana and Jane will have peeled the same number of oranges. 


**Answer:**  Both Ana and Jane will have peeled the same number of oranges.

"Mark's car needs a new radiator, and he found a great deal at a junk shop!  The radiator itself costs $400, but he got it for 80% off, so the price was $400 - (0.80 * $400) = $80.  He then hired a mechanic to install it, and it took 3 hours at $50 per hour.  The total cost for the radiator and installation is $80 + ($50/hour * 3 hours) = $80 + $150 = $230.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. 

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
