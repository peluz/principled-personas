"Josh's investment in the house is a classic example of a potential loss in a real estate investment.  While the 150% increase in value is a significant jump, it's important to consider the overall cost and potential risks involved.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial Investment:** Josh's initial investment of $80,000 represents the purchase price of the property.
* **Repairs:** The $50,000 spent on repairs is a significant expense that can be crucial for increasing the property's value. 
* **Appreciation:** The 150% increase in value suggests that the property's market value has increased significantly. 
* **Profit:**  The profit is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial investment. 

However, the calculation of profit is not straightforward.  The $120,000 increase in value is not the only factor to consider.  

**The calculation of profit is dependent on the sale price of the property.**  

**Therefore, the profit is negative, indicating a loss.**

"Let Darrell's current age be represented by the variable 'd' and Allen's current age be represented by the variable 'a'.  We are given that the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be expressed as:

d/a = 7/11

We also know that their total age is 162.  This can be expressed as:

d + a = 162

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'd' and 'a'.

From the ratio equation, we can express 'a' in terms of 'd':

a = (11/7)d

Substituting this value of 'a' into the total age equation:

d + (11/7)d = 162

Combining like terms:

(18/7)d = 162

Solving for 'd':

d = 162 * (7/18) = 63

Now, we can find 'a' using the value of 'd':

a = (11/7) * 63 = 99

Therefore, Darrell's current age is 63 and Allen's current age is 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:

99 + 10 = 109

**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

The key to solving this problem is understanding the concept of cumulative time.  The second runner on the less well-rounded team runs 3 seconds faster than the first, the third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second, and so on.  This means the time for each runner on the less well-rounded team is a geometric progression.

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we can calculate the sum of the times for each runner. 

The faster team's time is simply the sum of the times for each runner. 

The difference in time is the faster team's time minus the less well-rounded team's time.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw distributed to the rodents and the number of rats. 

* **Straw Distribution:** We know 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents.
* **Hamster Straw Usage:**  The hamsters use 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rat Straw Usage:** The remaining straw, 110 pieces, is used by the rats.

**Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used by the straw per rat:

* **Rat Distribution:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats

**Cage Size:**  To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:

* **Rat per Cage:** 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage

**Rounding:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 's' represent the number of snails in the first aquarium and 'f' represent the number of fish in the first aquarium.
*  We are given that the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.  
*  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. This translates to the equation: s - f = 2(s - f)

**Solving for 's' and 'f':**

1.  Simplify the equation: s - f = 2s - 2f
2.  Combine like terms: -s + f = -2f
3.  Solve for 's': s = 3f

**Since we know that the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, we can substitute this into the equation s = 3f:**

4 = 3f
f = 4/3

**Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 4/3.**

*  *y* represent the number of boxes Meg has.

We know the following:

*  *x* + *y* = total boxes needed 
*  *12x* + *2* = total pencils

We can solve for *x* and *y* using the following steps:

1. **Solve for *x*:**

* **Solving for Individual Weights:**
    * Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

* **Calculating Total Weight:**
    *  We need to add the weight of the container and the individual animals to find the total weight.

**Therefore, the total weight of the container and the animals is 20 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds = 190 pounds.**

"To determine Tyson's total distance for June, we need to consider the daily distance and the number of days in the month. 

* **Daily Distance:** Tyson runs 5000 meters per day.
* **Increase in Distance:** His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more, which translates to an increase of 5000 meters * (1/5) = 1000 meters.
* **Total Distance:**  His new daily distance is 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters.
* **Total Distance for June:**  June has 30 days. Therefore, Tyson covers 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters in June.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 's' represent the height of the shortest tree.
    * Let 't' represent the height of the second tree.
    * Let 'h' represent the height of the tallest tree.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  s = 6 feet (shortest tree)
    *  t = s + 5 feet (second tree is 5 feet taller)
    *  h = 2 * (s + t) (tallest tree is twice the combined height)

* **Solve for the tallest tree (h):**
    * Substitute the values of 's' and 't' into the equation for 'h':
       h = 2 * (6 + (6 + 5))
    * Simplify:
       h = 2 * (17)
       h = 34 feet

**Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.**

"To determine the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the total cost of the activities and the available budget. 

Let's break down the costs:

* **Mini-golf:**  The cost per person for mini-golf is $5.  
* **Go-karts:** The cost per ride for go-karts is $10. 

We need to find the maximum number of friends she can invite while staying within her $90 budget. 

**Let's represent the number of friends as 'x'.**

* **Mini-golf cost:** 5x
* **Go-kart cost:** 10 * x (since she's riding twice)
* **Total cost:** 5x + 10 * x = 15x

**Setting up the equation:**

15x ≤ 90

**Solving for x:**

x ≤ 90 / 15

x ≤ 6

"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased, we need to consider the following:

* **Initial funds:** Billy has $10.00.
* **Candy cost:**  The candy costs $1.50 per pound.
* **Gumball cost:** Gumballs cost $0.05 each, and Billy purchased 40.

**1. Calculate the cost of the candy:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of pounds of candy purchased.
*  The total cost of the candy is 1.50x.

**2. Calculate the change Billy received:**

*  The change Billy received is the initial amount minus the cost of the candy: $10.00 - 1.50x

**3. Calculate the amount spent on gumballs:**

*  The cost of the gumballs is 0.05 * 40 = $2.00

**4. Determine the remaining funds:**

*  The remaining funds after buying gumballs are: $10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00

**5. Solve for the number of pounds of candy:**

*  We know that the remaining funds ($8.00) represent the cost of the candy. 
*  Therefore, we can solve for x: 1.50x = $8.00
*  Divide both sides by 1.50: x = 5.33 pounds.

**Answer:** Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy.

"The train's total distance traveled per day is 675 miles.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to find the ratio of the total distance traveled to the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  Therefore, the number of days between services is:

* **Number of days = Total distance traveled / Service interval**

* **Number of days = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service**

* **Number of days = 0.375**

* **Number of days = 375/1000 = 0.375**

* **Number of days = 0.375 days**

* **Number of days = 0.375 days * 24 hours/day = 9 hours**

* **Number of days = 9 hours / 24 hours/day = 0.375 days**

* **Number of days = 0.375 days * 365 days/year = 139.125 days**

* **Number of days = 139.125 days**



**Final answer: 139.125**

"The trip can be broken down into three distinct segments:

1. **Travel to the friend's house:**  The distance is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph.  The time taken for this segment is:

   Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

2. **Detour:** The detour adds 10 miles to the trip, and the speed remains 70 mph.  The time taken for this segment is:

   Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

3. **Return home:** The distance is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. The time taken for this segment is:

   Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

The total time for the trip is the sum of the three segments:

"This problem requires us to use the concept of conditional probability.  

Let's break it down:

* **Event A:** A candle smells like wet dog.
* **Event B:** A candle explodes.

We are given that 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This means:

* P(A) = 0.05 (probability of a candle smelling like wet dog)
* P(B) = 0.99 (probability of a candle not exploding)

We are asked to find the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding.  

**Key Concept:**  The probability of two events happening together is calculated as the product of their individual probabilities.  

Therefore, the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding is:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

Where P(B|A) is the probability of a candle exploding given that it is defective.  

Since we are given that 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that the probability of a candle exploding given that it is defective is 0.99.

"The problem presents a scenario with a few inconsistencies.  

First, the horse's speed is given in miles per hour (MPH), but the time is given in minutes.  To convert the time to hours, we need to divide the time in minutes by 60. 

Second, the problem states that Michael has six five-dollar bills.  However, the value of the bills is not relevant to the calculation of the cost of the hay. 

To calculate the cost of the hay, we need to know the distance the horse runs.  The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 MPH, which is equal to 0.5 hours.  

The horse runs 16 miles.  The cost of a bail of hay is $3.  Therefore, the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24. 

The problem asks for the change Michael has after buying the hay.  The change is the amount of money Michael has minus the cost of the hay.  Michael has $6.00 and the cost of the hay is $24.00.  Therefore, Michael has -$18.00 in change.

"The height of the pyramid can be determined by considering the heights of the cheerleaders in each layer.  

* **Base:** The base of the pyramid consists of 4 cheerleaders, each with a height of 64 inches.  The total height of the base is 4 * 64 inches = 256 inches.
* **Second Layer:** The second layer consists of 3 cheerleaders, each with a height of 64 inches. The total height of the second layer is 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches.
* **Third Layer:** The third layer consists of 2 cheerleaders, each with a height of 64 inches. The total height of the third layer is 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the layers: 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches = 576 inches.

To convert this to feet, divide the total height in inches by 12 inches per foot: 576 inches / 12 inches/foot = 48 feet.

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost-equivalent, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other.  

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 (flat fee) + $5x (cost of food) = $200 + 5x
* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25x (cost per guest)

Setting the two cost equations equal:

$200 + 5x = $25x

Solving for x:

* Subtract 5x from both sides: $200 = 20x
* Divide both sides by 20: x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be cost-equivalent.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the number of insects Lily found.

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Formulate the Equation:**
    * The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the Equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Calculate Lily's Insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

"Frederick's goal is to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can produce while minimizing the cost of wood.  This problem can be solved using linear programming. 

Let's define the variables:

*  *x* = the number of 2x4 pieces purchased
*  *y* = the number of 2x8 pieces purchased

We need to find the optimal values of *x* and *y* that minimize the cost while satisfying the constraint of the total number of sticks.

The cost function is:

* Cost = 4*x + 6*y

The constraint is:

* 200*x + 400*y ≤ 1200  (This represents the total number of sticks Frederick can make)

We can use linear programming techniques to solve this problem.  However, a simple approach is to consider the cost per stick and determine the number of sticks Frederick can make with the available budget. 

Since the 2x4 is the cheaper option, we can determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make by finding the maximum number of 2x4 pieces he can purchase with his $24 budget. 

* $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

This means Frederick can purchase 6 pieces of 2x4. 

* 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks

Therefore, Frederick can make 1200 popsicle sticks.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  This information can be represented as a system of equations:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia purchased.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of potatoes Sophia purchased.

We are given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. This translates to the following equations:

*  y = 4x 
*  x + y = total number of onions and potatoes

We also know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  We can substitute the value of 'y' from the first equation into the second equation:

*  x + 4x = total number of onions and potatoes

Simplifying the equation:

*  5x = total number of onions and potatoes

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides by 5:

*  x = total number of onions and potatoes / 5

We can now substitute the value of 'x' back into the equation y = 4x to find the value of 'y':

*  y = 4 * (total number of onions and potatoes / 5)

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is equal to the value of 'x' which is the number of onions Sophia bought.

"This problem can be modeled using the concept of a geometric series.  Each round of calls effectively doubles the number of families notified.  

* **Round 1:** 3 families
* **Round 2:** 3 * 3 = 9 families
* **Round 3:** 9 * 3 = 27 families
* **Round 4:** 27 * 3 = 81 families

The pattern is a geometric series with a first term of 3 and a common ratio of 3.  The general formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term
* r = the common ratio
* n = the number of terms

In this case, we have:

S = 3(1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)

S = 3(-80) / (-2)
S = 120

Therefore, **120 families** will be notified during the fourth round of calls.

"Let's analyze the problem using a system of equations to represent the given information. 

Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.  The problem states that the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue.  This translates to the following equations:

*  Red jelly beans = 0.99b
*  Green jelly beans = 1.01b

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three types:

* Total jelly beans = b + 0.99b + 1.01b

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.  Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

* 4500 = b + 0.99b + 1.01b

Combining like terms, we get:

* 4500 = 2.99b

Solving for 'b', we find:

* b = 4500 / 2.99 
* b ≈ 1500

Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

* Green jelly beans = 1.01b = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:

"The beanstalk's growth follows a geometric sequence.  To determine the number of days it takes to reach the window, we need to find the value of *n* in the geometric sequence where the first term is 4 and the common ratio is 2. 

The general formula for a geometric sequence is: aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1), where aₙ is the nth term, a₁ is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, we have:

* a₁ = 4
* r = 2
* aₙ = 20 (the height of the window)

Substituting these values into the formula:

20 = 4 * 2^(n-1)

Dividing both sides by 4:

5 = 2^(n-1)

To find the value of n, we can use logarithms:

log₂(5) = n - 1

Solving for n:

n = log₂(5) + 1

Using a calculator, we find:

n ≈ 3.32

Since n must be a whole number, we can conclude that it takes **approximately 3 days** for the beanstalk to reach the window.

"To determine the lifespan of a tire based on the given information, we need to consider the relationship between tire rotations and mileage. 

The provided information states that the tire rotates 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  

We can calculate the total rotations for the given mileage:

* Total rotations = (Rotations per mile) * (Miles driven)
* Total rotations = 725 * 400 = 290,000 rotations

To determine the number of years before tire replacement, we need to consider the total rotations per year and the total rotations for the given mileage.

* Total rotations per year = 10,440,000 rotations
* Total rotations for 400 miles = 290,000 rotations

Therefore, the number of years to replace the tire is:

* Years to replace tires = (Total rotations per year) / (Total rotations for 400 miles)
* Years to replace tires = 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36.7 years

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Dylan's investment be represented by 'x'.
* Let Frances's investment be represented by 'y'.
* Let Skyler's investment be represented by 'z'.

We know the following:

* x + y + z = $1200 (The total investment)
* x = (2/5) * $1200 (Dylan's investment)
* y = (2/3) * ($1200 - x) (Frances's investment)
* z = $1200 - x - y (Skyler's investment)

Substituting the value of x from the first equation into the second equation:

* y = (2/3) * ($1200 - (2/5) * $1200)
* y = (2/3) * ($1200 - $480)
* y = (2/3) * $720
* y = $480

Now, substitute the value of y into the third equation:

* z = $1200 - x - y
* z = $1200 - (2/5) * $1200 - $480
* z = $1200 - $480 - $480
* z = $240

"Ron faces a complex economic dilemma.  The cost of repairing the pothole, while seemingly straightforward, involves a trade-off between the cost of the repair and the potential cost of damage to his vehicle. 

The city's refusal to address the pothole, while frustrating, presents a legal and financial hurdle.  The fine for unauthorized road maintenance is a significant deterrent, but the potential damage to his vehicle is a more immediate concern. 

To analyze the situation, we need to consider the following:

"The average time taken by the cat and dog to consume the sausages can be calculated by first determining the individual rates of consumption. 

The cat consumes 9 sausages in 30 minutes, which translates to a consumption rate of 9/30 = 0.3 sausages per minute. 

The dog, on the other hand, consumes sausages at a rate of 1 sausage per 20 minutes (2/3 of the cat's time). 

To find the average time, we need to consider the time taken by each animal to consume a specific number of sausages. 

The cat consumes 9 sausages in 30 minutes, and the dog consumes 1 sausage in 20 minutes. 

Therefore, the average time taken by the cat and dog to consume the sausages is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes. 

The average time taken by the cat and dog to consume the sausages is 50 minutes / 2 animals = 25 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations to represent the given information:

* Let Dora's age be represented by 'd'
* Dora's father's age is represented by 'f'
* Dora's mother's age is represented by 'm'

We are given the following information:

*  f = 2d + 8  (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
*  m = f - 4  (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)
* d = 15  (Dora's current age)

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to find Dora's father's age:

* f = 2(15) + 8
* f = 30 + 8
* f = 38

Finally, substitute the value of 'f' into the third equation to find Dora's mother's age:

* m = 38 - 4

"The cost of the two pizzas is a linear function of the total cost of the four pizzas.  We can solve for the cost of each of the other two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost. 

The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.  The cost of two pizzas is $30.  Therefore, the cost of the other two pizzas is $64 - $30 = $34.  

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is $34 / 2 = $17.

"Andy's weekly fuel consumption is determined by the distance he travels and his fuel efficiency.  

* **Distance:** The one-way distance to work is 5 miles.
* **Fuel Efficiency:** Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

To calculate the weekly fuel consumption, we can use the following formula:

* **Weekly Fuel Consumption (gallons) = (Distance / Fuel Efficiency) * Number of Days**

In this case:

* Weekly Fuel Consumption = (5 miles / 10 MPG) * 5 days = 2.5 gallons

To determine the weekly cost, we can multiply the weekly fuel consumption by the price per gallon:

* **Weekly Cost = Weekly Fuel Consumption * Price per Gallon**

Therefore, the weekly cost of gas for Andy's car is:

* **Weekly Cost = 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50**


**Answer:** $7.50

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Smart TVs:**  The store sells one-fourth of its TVs as smart TVs, meaning they sell 1/4 of the total number of TVs.
* **Analog TVs:** The store sells one-eighth of its TVs as analog TVs, meaning they sell 1/8 of the total number of TVs.
* **OLED TVs:** The remaining TVs are OLED TVs.  

The total number of TVs sold is 40.  We can represent this as:

*  Smart TVs + Analog TVs + OLED TVs = 40

We know that the total number of TVs sold is 40.  We can use this information to find the number of OLED TVs sold. 

**Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.**

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we need to consider the temperature difference between the day and night and the heat output per log. 

The temperature difference between the day and night is 33 degrees.  This means the house needs to be heated by 33 degrees to reach a temperature of 32 degrees.

The heat output of each log is 5 degrees.  To calculate the number of logs needed, we divide the total temperature difference by the heat output per log:

Number of logs = (Temperature difference) / (Heat output per log) = 33 degrees / 5 degrees/log = 6.6 logs.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a log, Carson needs to burn **7 logs** to ensure the pipes do not freeze.

"The distance between the two cars after 2 hours can be determined by considering their relative speeds and the time elapsed.  

The key is to recognize that the cars are traveling at different speeds, and the relative speed at which they are closing the distance is the key to determining the separation. 

The second car is traveling 10 miles per hour faster than the first car.  Therefore, the distance between the cars after 2 hours is the difference in their speeds multiplied by the time elapsed. 

The difference in speed is 70 mph - 60 mph = 10 mph. 

The distance traveled by the second car is 10 mph * 2 hours = 20 miles. 

The distance between the cars is 20 miles. 


**Answer:** 20 miles

"The problem describes a geometric sequence where the number of students doubles each month.  

To find the total number of students added, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (10 students)
* r = the common ratio (2)
* n = the number of terms (5, since we're looking at the end of May)

Plugging in the values:

S = 10(1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 10(1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 10(-31) / (-1)
S = 310

Therefore, **310** additional students joined the campus by the end of May.

"Felix's earnings of $105 can be interpreted as the total revenue generated from his tree climbing services.  To determine the average number of branches climbed per day, we need to consider the cost per branch and the number of days he worked. 

The cost per branch is $0.25, and he earned $105.  Therefore, the total number of branches climbed can be calculated as follows:

Total branches = Total earnings / Cost per branch = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

To determine the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches climbed by the number of days worked:

Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day.

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of cards Becca possesses.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
    * Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    * Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Formulate the equation:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**

"Boris's production pattern exhibits a simple pattern of decreasing production each week.  

* Week 1: 8,000 bars
* Week 2: 4,000 bars (half of Week 1)
* Week 3: 24,000 bars (three times Week 1)

To determine the production for Week 4, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract that from his monthly production.

Total production for Weeks 1-3: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Therefore, Week 4 production is: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

* **Second leg:** 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles. 


"
"The problem can be solved using the concept of proportionality.  

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the speed of a turtle as 't'.  We know that the time taken for the kangaroos to travel a distance 'd' is 18 hours.  

We can express this relationship as:

* Time = Distance / Speed
* 18 = d/k

We also know that the time taken for four turtles to travel the same distance 'd' is 36 hours.  We can express this relationship as:

* Time = d/t

Since the distance 'd' is constant, we can equate the two expressions:

* 18 = d/k = d/t

Solving for 't', we get:

* t = d/18 

We can substitute the value of 't' in the second equation:

* 36 = d/18

Therefore, the time taken for four turtles to travel the same distance is 36 hours.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We are also given that Paul is 10 years older than John.  We are asked to find Peter's age.

Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and John with the variables P, P+10, and J respectively.  

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  P + P + J = 100  (The sum of their ages is 100)
*  P = P + 10 + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

From the second equation, we can isolate J:
* J = 100 - 2P

Now, substitute this value of J into the first equation:
* P + P + (100 - 2P) = 100

Simplify and solve for P:
* 2P + 100 - 2P = 100
* 100 = 100

This equation is true for any value of P.  

Therefore, we can conclude that the given information is inconsistent.  There is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Deanna is 26 years old.
* Marcus is half of Leo's age, meaning Marcus's age is equal to 1/2 of Leo's age.
* We can express this relationship as an equation:  Marcus's age = (1/2) * Leo's age.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can write another equation: Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5.

Now, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

(1/2) * Leo's age = Deanna's age - 5

Substitute Deanna's age (26) into the equation:

(1/2) * Leo's age = 26 - 5

Simplify:

(1/2) * Leo's age = 21

Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate Leo's age:

Leo's age = 21 * 2

Therefore, Leo's age is:

**Leo's age = 42**

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. Let's represent the scores as follows:

*  Let Dinar's score be represented by 'D'
*  Let Azibo's score be represented by 'A'
*  Let Bahati's score be represented by 'B'

We are given the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to eliminate 'B':

*  A + 20 = D + 10
*  A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of 'A' into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for 'D':

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of 'D' back into the equation for 'A':

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately **1.67 points**.

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.

We are given that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can express this as a system of equations:

*  Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following relationships:

*  A = S + 5  
*  S = 4W - 13
*  A + S + W = 339

To solve for S (Stan's catch), we can use a substitution method.  

First, we can substitute the first equation (A = S + 5) into the third equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

Combining like terms: 2S + W = 339

Next, we can substitute the second equation (S = 4W - 13) into the above equation:

2(4W - 13) + W = 339

Simplifying: 8W - 26 + W = 339

Combining like terms: 9W - 26 = 339

Adding 26 to both sides: 9W = 365

Dividing both sides by 9: W = 40.56.  Since we are dealing with Pokemon, we round this to 41.

Now, we can substitute the value of W back into the second equation to find S:

S = 4(41) - 13

Simplifying: S = 164 - 13

Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the difference in chocolate bars per box, we can utilize the concept of relative quantities.  

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter as 'P' and for Martha as 'M'.  We are given the following information:

*  P + M = 64 (total chocolate bars for Peter and Martha)
*  P = M + 8 (Peter has 8 more chocolate bars per box than Martha)

We can solve this system of equations to find the values of P and M.

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:

(M + 8) + M = 64

Combining like terms:

2M + 8 = 64

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2M = 56

Dividing both sides by 2:

M = 28

Now, substitute the value of M back into the equation P = M + 8:

P = 28 + 8

Therefore:

P = 36

The difference in chocolate bars per box is:

P - M = 36 - 28 = 8

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount from day 1, which is 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount from day 1, which is 1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. The total pumped on day 2 is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total gallons pumped over two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Therefore, the remaining water in the tank is 18000 - 12000 = **6000 gallons**.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the initial charge of the power bank.

* **Understanding the Rate of Discharge:** The power bank experiences a constant rate of discharge, meaning the percentage of charge lost is consistent over time. 
* **Initial Charge:**  We can assume the power bank was fully charged initially.
* **First 5 Hours:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for 5 hours, resulting in a 45% loss. This means the power bank had 55% of its initial charge remaining after 5 hours.
* **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank experiences a change in the rate of discharge, losing 7% of its charge per hour for 3 hours. This results in a 21% loss, leaving the power bank with 34% of its initial charge.
* **Final Charge:** The power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.

**Therefore, the power bank had 75% of its charge at the start.**

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the net present value (NPV) of his earnings. 

Here's how to calculate the NPV:

* **Net Present Value (NPV):**  The NPV represents the present value of future cash flows, discounted at a specific rate.  In this case, we'll assume a discount rate of 5% to account for the time value of money.

* **Future Earnings:** Jim's annual earnings increase from $25,000 to $75,000 after college.  This represents a 2.5-fold increase.

* **Loan Payments:** Jim's annual loan payments are $50,000.

* **Lost Income:** Jim loses $25,000 per year while in college.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the present value of future earnings:**
   *  Future earnings = $75,000 * (1 + 0.05)^4  
   *  Future earnings = $75,000 * 1.229
   *  Future earnings = $93,675

2. **Calculate the present value of lost income:**
   *  Present value of lost income = $25,000 * (1 + 0.05)^4
   *  Present value of lost income = $25,000 * 1.229
   *  Present value of lost income = $30,725

3. **Calculate the total present value of future earnings and lost income:**
   *  Total present value = $93,675 + $30,725
   *  Total present value = $124,400

4. **Calculate the time to reach the total present value:**
   *  Time = Total present value / Future earnings
   *  Time = $124,400 / $75,000
   *  Time = 1.69 years

**Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 1.69 years to recoup his loan payments and lost income.**

"To determine the share of the first person, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let:

*  *x* represent the amount the first person received.
*  *y* represent the amount the second person received.
*  *z* represent the amount the third person received.

We know the following:

*  *y = x + $80* 
*  *z = 2(x + $80)*

The total amount divided by the number of people is equal to the share of each person:

(x + y + z) / 3 = $1920

Substituting the values of *y* and *z* from the first two equations:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

(4x + $160) / 3 = $1920

Multiplying both sides by 3:

4x + $160 = $5760

Subtracting $160 from both sides:

4x = $5600

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = $1400

Therefore, the first person received **$1400**.

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.  The problem states that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than the second set, implying a relationship of the form:

* First set = x + 4

The third set had half the number of balls retrieved in the second set, meaning:

* Third set = (x/2)

The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is 19.  Therefore:

* x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combining like terms and solving for x:

* (5/2)x + 4 = 19
* (5/2)x = 15
* x = 6

This means Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we can use the relationship:

* First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved **10** tennis balls in the first set.

"Greg's laundry needs can be modeled using a system of linear equations. Let's represent the number of loads of laundry as L, where L represents the total number of loads per week.  

* **Twin sets:** Greg washes 2 sets of twin sheets per load.
* **King sets:** Greg washes 1 set of king sheets per load.

We can express the total number of loads per week as:

L = 2 * (number of twin sets) + 1 * (number of king sets)

We know that Greg washes 5 beds per week, and each bed requires a single set of sheets. Therefore, the number of sets of sheets per week is:

Number of sets = 5 beds

"Leo's sticker collection exhibits a simple arithmetic progression.  We can model this with a linear function:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of years since two years ago.
*  The number of stickers in the collection at any given time can be represented as:  S(x) = 100 + 50(x-2) + 100(x-2)

To find the total number of stickers, we need to find the value of 'x' that corresponds to the current year. 

*  We know that the number of stickers this year is twice the number of stickers from last year. 
*  Therefore, S(x) = 100 + 50(x-2) + 100(x-2) = 2(100 + 50(x-2) + 100(x-2))

Solving for x, we get:

*  S(x) = 100 + 50(x-2) + 100(x-2) = 200 + 100(x-2) + 200(x-2)
*  S(x) = 300 + 300(x-2)
*  S(x) = 300x - 600

This equation represents the total number of stickers in Leo's collection as a function of time. 

To find the total number of stickers, we need to find the value of 'x' that corresponds to the current year. 

*  We know that the number of stickers this year is twice the number of stickers from last year. 
*  Therefore, S(x) = 300x - 600 = 2(100 + 50(x-2) + 100(x-2))
*  Solving for x, we get: 
*  300x - 600 = 200 + 100(x-2) + 200(x-2)
*  300x - 600 = 200 + 100x - 200 + 200x - 400
*  300x - 600 = 300x - 600
*  This equation is true for all values of x. 

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is 300x - 600.

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to consider the relationship between the speeds of the cars.  

Let's denote:

*  *x* = the speed of the average car (mph)
*  *y* = the speed of the 2nd fastest car (mph)
*  *z* = the speed of the faster car (mph)

We are given:

* *y* = 5 * *x* 
* *z* = 1.25 * *y*

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

* *z* = 1.25 * (5 * *x*)
* *z* = 6.25 * *x*

We are also given that the average car has a speed of *x* = 120 mph.  Substituting this into the equation for *z*, we get:

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations to represent the given information:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We are given the following information:

*  Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  Total eggs painted: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

Solving for 'y' in the second equation:
* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

Substituting this value of 'y' into the third equation:
* 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
* 56 = 56 

This equation is true for any value of 'x' and 'y'.  This means that the given information is inconsistent. 

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem as the given information is contradictory.**

"To determine the number of seashells each person receives, we can break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let's denote:**
    *  *C* = the number of seashells Carlos collected
    *  *J* = the number of seashells Jim collected
    *  *K* = the number of seashells Carrey collected

* **We are given:**
    * *J = C + 5* 
    * *C = 2 * K*
    * *J + C + K = 60* (total number of seashells)

* **Substituting:**
    * Since *J = C + 5*, we can substitute *C + 5* for *J* in the third equation: * (C + 5) + C + K = 60*
    * Simplifying: *2C + 5 + K = 60*

* **Solving for C:**
    * We know *C = 2K*, so substitute this into the equation: *2(2K) + 5 + K = 60*
    * Simplifying: *4K + 5 + K = 60*
    * Combining like terms: *5K + 5 = 60*
    * Subtracting 5 from both sides: *5K = 55*
    * Dividing both sides by 5: *K = 11*

* **Finding C:**
    * Since *C = 2K*, we can substitute *11* for *K*: *C = 2 * 11*
    * Therefore, *C = 22*

* **Finding J:**
    * We know *J = C + 5*, so substitute *22* for *C*: *J = 22 + 5*
    * Therefore, *J = 27*

* **Calculating the share:**
    * Each person receives 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic variables to represent the lengths of the ropes.

*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'y - 7'.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, meaning its length is '4(y - 7)'.

The total length of the three ropes is 37 cm, so we can set up the following equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37

Solving for 'y':

6y = 72
y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (y = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 cm**.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let Colin's current age be represented by 'C' and Wendy's current age by 'W'.  We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** W = 5(C + 7)  This represents Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age plus seven.
* **Equation 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) This represents Colin's age in 25 years, expressed as a fraction of Wendy's age in 25 years.

To solve for Colin's current age, we can substitute the value of W from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Simplifying and solving for C:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
* 3C + 75 = 5C + 60
* 15 = 2C
* C = 7.5

Therefore, Colin is currently 7.5 years old.

"To determine the time it takes Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds and melts snowballs. 

* **Building Rate:** Jay builds 1/3 snowball per minute.
* **Melting Rate:** He melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes.

We can model this as a system of differential equations. Let 't' represent time in minutes and 'S' represent the number of snowballs. 

The rate of change of snowballs is determined by the difference between the building rate and the melting rate. 

* dS/dt = (1/3) - (2/15)

To find the time it takes to reach 60 snowballs, we need to solve the differential equation:

* S(t) = ∫(1/3 - 2/15) dt

Solving this integral, we get:

* S(t) = (1/3)t - (2/15)t + C

To determine the constant of integration, we need an initial condition.  We know that at t=0, S=0.  

* 0 = (1/3)(0) - (2/15)(0) + C
* C = 0

Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is:

* S(t) = (1/3)t - (2/15)t

To find the time it takes to reach 60 snowballs, we need to solve for t when S = 60.

* 60 = (1/3)t - (2/15)t
* 60 = (5/15)t
* t = 180 minutes

Therefore, it takes Jay **180 minutes** to have 60 snowballs. 



**Answer:** 180 minutes

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The problem states that John's age in relation to Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release is a key factor.  This suggests a linear relationship where John's age is twice Jim's age.

* **Solving for Jim's Age:**  We know John's current age is 28.  To find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we need to consider the age difference. 

* **Calculating Jim's Age:**  Since John was twice as old as Jim at the time of Digimon's release, we can set up an equation:

   Let Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release be represented by 'x'.

   John's age at the time of Digimon's release = 2x

   We know John's current age is 28, so: 2x = 28

   Solving for x: x = 28 / 2 = 14

**Answer:** Jim was 14 years old when Digimon was released.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, and we need to find the length of the longer piece.  

Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4x.  

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Therefore, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Let's analyze the problem.  We are given that Carly makes a certain number of cupcakes and brownies for her art class.  We are also given that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by a linear equation.  

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'.  We can express the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes as follows:

* b = 3c - 2

This equation represents the fact that the number of brownies is three times the number of cupcakes minus 2.

We are also given that the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) must be 10.  This can be expressed as:

* c + b = 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

* c + (3c - 2) = 10

Simplifying the equation:

* 4c - 2 = 10

Solving for 'c':

* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

* We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation: x - 4 = 27.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 27 + 4
x = 31

Therefore, Kim has **31** paintings.

"Bud's weekly macaroni and cheese expenditure can be analyzed by considering the cost of the pasta and the cheese.  

* **Pasta cost:**  The cost of the pasta is a constant, at $1.00 per box.
* **Cheese cost:**  The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week.  The gruyere cheese is twice the price of the cheddar, so its cost is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 per week.
* **Total weekly cost:** The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 per week.
* **Yearly cost:**  Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in a year he makes 52 weeks * $9.00/week = $468.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 on making macaroni and cheese in a year.

"The cost of the main phone is represented by the variable 'x'.  The cost of each additional phone is represented by 'y'.  We are given that the total cost of the plan is $20.  We can set up the following equation:

x = 2y

We are also given that the total cost of the plan is $20.  We can set up the following equation:

"The force required to move the car is determined by the car's weight and the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road.  

The force required to overcome the weight of the car and its occupants is given by Newton's Second Law of Motion:

**F = ma**

Where:

* F is the force applied
* m is the mass of the object
* a is the acceleration

We can simplify this to:

**F = mg**

Where:

* F is the force
* m is the mass
* g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s²)

First, we need to calculate the total mass of the car and its occupants:

* Mass = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds = 1600 pounds

Now, we can calculate the force required to move the car:

* F = 1600 pounds * 9.8 m/s² 
* F = 15680 Newtons

Therefore, the force required to move the car is approximately 15680 Newtons.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill the holes, we need to consider the rate at which he fills them and the rate at which the dog digs. 

* **Digging Rate:** The dog digs 6 holes per night.
* **Filling Rate:** Nate fills 9 holes per day.

To find the total number of holes filled, we need to consider the rate at which Nate fills the holes and the number of holes dug each day. 

* **Total Holes Dug:** The dog digs 6 holes per night * 14 days = 84 holes.
* **Total Holes Filled:** Nate fills 9 holes per day * 14 days = 126 holes.

To find the number of weeks to fill the holes, we need to consider the rate at which Nate fills the holes and the rate at which the dog digs. 

* **Total Holes to Fill:** 84 holes (dug) + 84 holes (dug) = 168 holes.
* **Weeks to Fill:** 168 holes / (9 holes/day * 7 days/week) = 1.5 weeks.


**Answer:** 1.5 weeks

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can use the following equation:

Total Cookies = Rainbow Cookies + Oatmeal Cookies + Chocolate Chip Cookies

We know the total number of cookies is 7995, the number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.  Therefore, we can solve for the number of chocolate chip cookies:

7995 = 2595 + 3075 + Chocolate Chip Cookies

7995 = 5670 + Chocolate Chip Cookies

Chocolate Chip Cookies = 7995 - 5670

Chocolate Chip Cookies = 2325


**Answer: 2325**

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

We are given the following information:

* **Test tubes:** Igor was instructed to gather 16 test tubes. He collected 8, which is half the requested amount.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor was instructed to gather 14 Petri dishes. He collected 16, which is two more than the requested amount.
* **Total items:** The total number of items Igor placed on the bench is 29.

We can use this information to determine the number of beakers Igor lost. 

Let's denote:

*  *t* = the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered
*  *p* = the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered
*  *b* = the number of beakers Igor lost

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  *t = 16 / 2 = 8*
*  *p = 14 + 2 = 16*
*  *t + p + b = 29*

We can now solve for *b*.  

*  *8 + 16 + b = 29*
*  *24 + b = 29*
*  *b = 29 - 24*
*  *b = 5*

Therefore, Igor lost **5** beakers.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Relative Speeds:**  We are given that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's. This means their speeds are in a ratio of 2:1.
* **Distance and Time Relationship:**  The problem states Vanessa ran twice the distance Aaron did. This implies a direct relationship between distance and time, where the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed. 
* **Solving for Vanessa's Time:**  We know Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 2 miles.  Since their speeds are in a ratio of 2:1, we can use the following relationship:

   * Time = Distance / Speed

   * Vanessa's time = 4 miles / (2 * Vanessa's speed)

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We are given the following information:

*  **Equation 1:** c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
*  **Equation 2:** 2c + 4w = 70 (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for 'c', we can use a substitution method.  From Equation 1, we can isolate 'w':
* w = 20 - c

Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:
* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplify and solve for 'c':
* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
