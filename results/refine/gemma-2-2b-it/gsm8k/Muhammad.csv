"Let's break down the problem.  We know the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.

We are given that their total age is 162.  To find Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age difference between them. 

Let's denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x.  We can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms: 18x = 162

Solving for x: x = 162 / 18 = 9

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age in 10 years = 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Gretchen has 110 coins.  Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we can write the equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for x, we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Therefore, x = 40, and the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

The total points scored by Mike is 4 points + 9 points = 13 points.

"Based on the nutritional information, a 300g bag of chips contains 1250 calories.  

To determine how many grams you can consume, we need to consider your daily calorie target and the calories already consumed. 

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. This leaves you with 200 calories to consume. 

To calculate the grams of chips you can eat, we need to consider the calorie content per serving. Each serving of chips contains 250 calories. 

Therefore, you can consume 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings. 

Since each serving is 250 grams, you can consume 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams of chips.

"Marcy's pension is a complex calculation.  Here's how to break it down:

* **Years of service:** Marcy has worked for 40 years.
* **Initial Pension:**  She receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.
* **Tiered Pension:** After 20 years, her pension is calculated as 5% of the total pension earned over the first 20 years. 

To calculate the total pension earned over the first 20 years, we use the formula:

* Total Pension = Annual Pension * Years Worked
* Total Pension = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000

Now, to calculate the total pension earned after 30 years, we need to consider the tiered pension. 

* **Tiered Pension:**  The tiered pension is calculated as 5% of the total pension earned over the first 20 years. 
* **Tiered Pension:**  5% of $1,000,000 = $50,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $1,000,000 + $50,000 = $1,050,000.

"The team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  To find the number of wins, we need to determine the number of losses first.  

If we assume the team lost 'x' games, then they won 'x + 8' games.  The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 7

Therefore, the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we add 8 to the number of losses:

x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

"Let's break down the problem.

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years.  This means his salary now is 1.4 times his salary four years ago.  We also know that Lylah's salary increased by 30% over four years.  

To find the total salary, we need to consider both Adrien and Lylah's salary increases. 

**Here's how to calculate the total salary:**

* **Adrien's salary four years ago:** $40000
* **Adrien's salary now:** $40000 * 1.40 = $56000
* **Lylah's salary four years ago:** $3077 (calculated previously)
* **Lylah's salary now:** $3077 * 1.40 = $4300

**Total salary four years later:** $56000 + $4300 = $60300


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60300.**

"The hive's population is a fascinating study in bee dynamics.  We know the number of worker bees is directly related to the number of baby bees and queens.  

Let's break it down:

* **Queens:**  The number of queens is a fundamental factor in the hive's structure.
* **Baby Bees:**  Baby bees are the foundation of the hive's future generation.
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees are the industrious workforce, responsible for tasks like foraging and hive maintenance.

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

**w = 2b**

Where 'w' represents the number of worker bees and 'b' represents the number of baby bees.

We also know that:

**b = 2q**

Where 'q' represents the number of queens.

Therefore, we can substitute 'b' in the first equation:

**w = 2 * (2q)**

**w = 4q**

Now, we can use the information that there are 700 bees in total:

**q + b + w = 700**

**q + (2q) + 4q = 700**

**7q = 700**

**q = 100**

Finally, we can calculate the number of worker bees:

**w = 4q = 4 * 100 = 400**

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

Here's why:

* **Tax laws are complex:**  They change frequently and require a deep understanding of deductions, credits, and regulations. An accountant ensures accuracy and compliance, which can save you from penalties and audits.
* **Time is valuable:**  While you might think you can save time by doing your taxes yourself, the time spent researching and navigating the complexities of tax laws could be better spent on your freelance work. 

**Therefore, hiring an accountant is the more financially sound option.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* In two years, their ages will sum to 28.

To find Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'.**
2. **Seth's current age is twice Brooke's age, so Seth's age is '2B'.**
3. **In two years, Brooke will be B + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2B + 2 years old.**
4. **The sum of their ages in two years will be (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28**

Now, let's solve for B:

* **Combine like terms:** 3B + 4 = 28
* **Subtract 4 from both sides:** 3B = 24
* **Divide both sides by 3:** B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* **Seth's age is 2B, so Seth's age is 2 * 8 = 16**


**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

"The rats are distributed in groups of 6 pieces of straw per rat.  We know that 160 pieces of straw were used in total.  To find the number of rats, we can use the following equation:

Total straw used = number of rats * pieces of straw per rat

We know that 160 pieces of straw were used, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.  We can solve for the number of rats:

160 = number of rats * 6

To find the number of rats, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

number of rats = 160 / 6

number of rats = 26.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, there are **26** rats in each cage.

* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **The key:**  The number of red chickens is equal to the number of white chickens plus 2.

To find the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up an equation:** Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.  Since the number of white chickens is 'w', we can write the following equation: 
   3r + 5w = 42

2. **Use the second equation:** We know that r = w + 2.  Substitute this into the first equation:
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

3. **Solve for 'w':**
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5

4. **Find 'r':**  Since 'w' represents the number of white chickens, we can substitute it back into the equation r = w + 2:
   r = 4.5 + 2
   r = 6.5

**Therefore, the number of red chickens is 6.5.** 


**Important Note:**  This answer is not a whole number, which indicates that there is likely an error in the problem statement.  It's important to remember that chickens can't lay half an egg.

"The problem presents a scenario that is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics.  

Here's why:

* **Leakage:**  A leak rate of 4 gallons per minute implies a continuous, steady loss of water.  
* **Water Conservation:**  The problem states that the pools are emptying at a constant rate.  This means the rate of water loss is independent of the amount of water in the pool. 

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

* **Initial Conditions:**  We need to know the initial amount of water in each pool.
* **Leakage Rate:**  The leakage rate is constant, but the problem does not provide a starting point for the amount of water in the pools. 

**Therefore, we cannot determine the amount of water in the small pool without additional information.**

"Lori needs to earn $352.00 to purchase the shoes and belt.  She earns $8.00 per hour.  To find out how many hours she needs to work, we can use the following equation:

"The total amount Janeth will pay is $1980.  To calculate the remaining balance, we need to consider the principal amount and the additional amount. 

The principal amount is $2000. The additional amount is 10% of the principal, which is $200. 

Therefore, the total amount Janeth will pay is $2000 + $200 = $2200. 

The remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years. 

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Finally, the average age of the three in three years is (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

* **Step 2: Remaining Watermelons:** After the initial harvest, 84 watermelons remained.

* **Step 3: Second Harvest:**  Three-quarters of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 63.

* **Step 4:  Watermelons Not Ready:**  To find the number of watermelons not ready, we subtract the number harvested from the initial number: 120 - 36 - 63 = 21.

"The redwood's weight is determined by the volume of wood it contains.  A 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.  

To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we need to consider the height of the tree and the weight of each section. 

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each section weighs 400 pounds.  Therefore, the total weight of the redwood is:

200 feet * 10 feet/section * 400 pounds/section = 80,000 pounds.

Now, we need to consider the weight of the wood eaten by termites.  Termites consume approximately 30% of the wood.  

The weight of the wood eaten by termites is:

80,000 pounds * 0.30 = 24,000 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood is:

"Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa.  He will need to allocate funds for several expenses.  

Let's analyze his spending:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each cost $600.
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases at $50 each cost $150.
* **Flight Ticket:** The flight ticket cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is $500.  Therefore, the flight ticket cost is $1200.
* **Total Spending:** The total cost of the suits, suitcases, and flight is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350.

He has $6000 - $2350 = $3650 remaining for other expenses.

**To determine how much he can spend on gifts, we need to consider his remaining budget.**

"The defense has **30** players.  

**Explanation:**

Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total number of players is 105.
* The offense has twice the number of players as the defense.
* The special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

To find the number of players on the defense, we can use the following steps:

1. **Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.**
2. **The offense has 2x players.**
3. **The special teams have x/2 players.**

Now, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + (x/2) = 105

Combine like terms: (7/2)x = 105

Solve for x: x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

"The ratio of electric poles to wires in a neighborhood is 1:3.  To determine the number of poles needed, we can use this ratio to calculate the number of poles required for a given number of wires.

Since the total number of wires is 45, and the ratio is 1:3, we can find the value of one unit by dividing the total wires by the ratio: 45 wires / 4 = 11.25.

To find the total number of poles, we multiply the value of one unit by the ratio: 11.25 * 3 = 33.75. 

Therefore, the total number of poles required is **34**.

"The coffee's strength is affected by the cooling process and the addition of cream.  

* **Cooling effect:**  The ice cubes cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
* **Weaker coffee:** Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
* **Total weakening:** 65 degrees * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters
* **Adding cream:** The cream adds 15 milliliters of weakening.
* **Final weakening:** 780 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 795 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is **795 milliliters** weaker.

"The problem presents a scenario that requires a careful examination of the trade ratio.  

The statement ""People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one"" implies a direct, one-to-one relationship between the number of old records and new records exchanged.  

To determine the number of old records brought in, we need to consider the trade ratio and the total number of new records obtained. 

**Therefore, the number of old records brought in is 7 / 2 = 3.5. **

"The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes. To reach 100% charge, the phone needs to gain 40% of charge, which is equivalent to 40/100 * 100 = 40% of the total charge. 

To calculate the time required, we can use the following formula:

Time = (Target Charge / Charging Rate) * 3 minutes

In this case, the target charge is 100% and the charging rate is 1% per 3 minutes. Therefore, the time required to reach 100% charge is:

Time = (100 / 1) * 3 = 300 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

"Job B offers a higher net pay compared to Job A.  Let's analyze the details:

* **Job A:**
    * Hourly rate: $15
    * Hours worked: 2000
    * Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:**
    * Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
    * Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
    * Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Therefore, Job B offers a net pay of $8,400 more than Job A.**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same number of students. The remaining group is 10 fewer than each of the other two groups.  To find the number of students in the smallest group, we need to consider the total number of students in the class. 

Let's represent the number of students in each of the equal groups as 'x'.  The number of students in the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.

The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

Solving for x, we get: 3x - 10 = 200
 
3x = 210
 
x = 70

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = **60**.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  $5 per person * number of friends
* **Go-karts:** $10 per ride * number of rides

To stay within her $90 budget, we need to find the maximum number of friends she can invite while keeping the cost of mini-golf and go-karts within the budget. 

**Here's how to solve it:**

1. **Calculate the cost of mini-golf:**  $5 * number of friends
2. **Calculate the cost of go-karts:** $10 * number of rides
3. **Set up an equation:** $5 * number of friends + $10 * number of rides = $90

**To find the maximum number of friends, we need to find the value of 'number of friends' that makes the equation true.**

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service, we need to know the total distance the train travels.  

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The train travels 675 miles in a day.  

To find the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the distance between services:

675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.3833333333333333

The number of days between services is 0.3833333333333333 * 18,000 miles/service = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.3833333333333333 days. 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 customers were removed for refusing to wear masks.
* **Shoplifting:** 7 individuals were removed for shoplifting.
* **Physical Violence:** 21 individuals were removed for physical violence related to goods on sale.

To determine the number of individuals removed for reasons other than mask refusal, shoplifting, or physical violence, we can subtract the total of those removed for the other reasons from the total number of individuals removed. 

Therefore, the number of individuals removed for other reasons is 50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = **10**.

* **Anna's gold pesos:** Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* **Total pesos:** To find the total, we add the pesos Axel and Anna have: 50 + 80 + 100 + 120 = 350 pesos.

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 350.

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To find the original amount of land he had, we can use the following equation:

**(1 - 3/5) * x = 12.8**

Where 'x' represents the original amount of land.

Simplifying the equation:

**(2/5) * x = 12.8**

Solving for 'x':

* Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned **32 hectares** of land.

"The AC's energy consumption is directly related to its power rating and the time it's used.  

If we know the AC's power rating is 900 watts and it's used for 8 hours a day, we can calculate the daily energy consumption. 

* Daily energy consumption = Power rating * Time used
* Daily energy consumption = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

If the user reduces the AC's usage by 5 hours, the daily energy consumption will be:

* Daily energy consumption = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

The energy saved per day is:

* Energy saved = Daily energy consumption (old) - Daily energy consumption (new)
* Energy saved = 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:

* Total energy saved in kWh = 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Therefore, the user will save **4.5 kWh** of energy in 30 days.

* **Meat cost:** 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
* **Cheese cost:** 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00
* **Total cost:** $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"The problem states that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and her sister gathers twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne.  This means the sister gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees. 

The problem also states that Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister.  We know that the sisters have a combined total of 500 apples.  Let's represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as ""x"".  

The total number of apples Joanne gathers is 30 + 15 + x.  The total number of apples her sister gathers is 60.  

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of apples: 30 + 15 + x + 60 = 500. 

Solving for x, we get: 
* 105 + x = 500
* x = 500 - 105
* x = 395

Therefore, Joanne gathered **395** apples from the average trees.

"The question presents a classic problem of simultaneous equations.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries by using the given information about the number of heads and bumps.

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know the following:

* **Heads:**  c + d = 180
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' in the first equation:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

We know that Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, who slew three-quarters of Prince Thaddeus's dragons.  

Prince Bruce, lacking a sword, used a nail file to slay one-fifth the number of dragons Prince Walter did. 

To find the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce, we must first determine the number of dragons Prince Walter slew. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, who slew three-quarters of Prince Thaddeus's 100 dragons.  

Prince Arthur slew three-quarters of Prince Thaddeus's 100 dragons, which is (3/4) * 100 = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce, lacking a sword, used a nail file to slay one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

**Answer:** Prince Bruce slain 30 dragons.

This can be expressed as an equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5

Solving for 'x', we get:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat **6** carrot sticks.

"The problem states that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.  This means that 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer.  We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer.  To find the total number of students, we can use the following equation:

* **Total students = (Students with computers) + (Students without computers)**

We can solve for the total number of students by using the information given:

* **Total students = (3/4)x - 20 = 1/4 * x**

Where 'x' represents the total number of students.

Solving for 'x', we get:

* **Total students = (3/4)x - 20 = 1/4 * x**
* **Total students = (3/4)x - (1/4)x = 20**
* **Total students = (1/4)x = 20**
* **Total students = 80**


**Answer:** There are 80 students at that grade level.

"The cost of the first venue is fixed at $200, regardless of the number of guests.  The second venue charges $25 per guest.  To determine the number of guests where the costs are equal, we need to find the point where the cost of each venue is the same.

Let's consider the cost of the second venue:

* **Venue 2:** Cost = $25 * number of guests

To find the number of guests where the cost is equal, we need to find the number of guests that make the cost of the second venue equal to the cost of the first venue.

* **Venue 1:** Cost = $200 + $5 * number of guests

Setting the two equations equal to each other:

* $25 * number of guests = $200 + $5 * number of guests

Solving for the number of guests:

* $25 * number of guests - $5 * number of guests = $200
* $20 * number of guests = $200
* number of guests = $200 / $20
* number of guests = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Bodhi's insects:**  We know the total insects are 43.  Let's represent the number of insects Bodhi found as 'x'.
* **David's insects:** David found half of Bodhi's insects, so he found x/2.
* **Lily's insects:** Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7.

Now, we can set up an equation: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects:

* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes.  

* Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought. 
* This means Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions.

We can also find out how many potatoes Sophia bought by using the same logic. 

* Rose bought 4 potatoes, and Sophia bought 3 onions. 
* This means Sophia bought 4 - 3 = 1 potato.

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 3 onions and 1 potato.

"The house cost three times the lot, so we can represent the cost of the lot as 'x'.  The cost of the house is then 3x.  The total cost of the house and lot is $120,000.  Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 3x = $120,000.  Solving for x, we get 4x = $120,000, and dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $30,000.  The cost of the house is 3x, so the house cost is 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"The new device will increase Ada's daily consumption by 2 kW/hour.  To calculate the difference in weekly bills, we need to consider the daily consumption and the cost per kilowatt-hour. 

**Weekly Consumption:**

* Ada's daily consumption is 12 kW/hour.
* The new device adds 2 kW/hour, so her new daily consumption is 14 kW/hour.
* Her weekly consumption is 14 kW/hour * 7 days/week = 98 kW/week.

**Weekly Bill Calculation:**

* Ada's weekly bill before the new device is 98 kW/week * $1.50/kW/hour = $147.00.
* Her weekly bill after the new device is 98 kW/week * $1.50/kW/hour = $147.00.

**Difference:**

* The difference in weekly bills is $147.00 - $147.00 = $0.00.

"The oven is off by a constant percentage, so we need to adjust the temperature to account for this.  

To find the correct temperature, we need to determine the percentage difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature. 

The desired temperature is 520 degrees, and the actual temperature is 468 degrees.  The difference is 520 - 468 = 52 degrees.

To find the percentage difference, we divide the difference by the original temperature: 52 / 450 = 0.11.

To find the adjustment, we multiply the percentage difference by the desired temperature: 0.11 * 520 = 57.2 degrees.

Therefore, the oven should be set to 520 + 57.2 = 577.2 degrees.

* **Red jelly beans:**  There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, meaning the number of red jelly beans is 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.
* **Green jelly beans:**  There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, meaning the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

To find the number of jelly beans for each color, we can use the following equation:

* **Total jelly beans = Blue jelly beans + Red jelly beans + Green jelly beans**

Let's solve for the number of blue jelly beans:

* **4500 = b + 0.99b + 1.01b**

Combining like terms:

* **4500 = 2.99b**

Solving for b:

* **b = 4500 / 2.99**
* **b = 1500**

Now, we can calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:

* **Red jelly beans:** 0.99 * 1500 = 1495
* **Green jelly beans:** 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

**Answer:** The jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago.  We can express this relationship as:

*  Age in 3 years = Age in 5 years + 3

To find the age in 3 years, we need to find the age in 5 years.  

* Age in 5 years = 2 * (Age in 5 years - 5)

Solving for Age in 5 years:

* Age in 5 years = 2 * Age in 5 years - 10
* Age in 5 years + 10 = 2 * Age in 5 years
* 10 = Age in 5 years * (2 - 1)
* 10 = Age in 5 years * 1
* Age in 5 years = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old. In 3 years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old. 

**Answer: 13**

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 

The total cost of the implants is $2500.  To calculate the amount George needs to earn, we need to subtract his deposit from the total cost.  The remaining amount is $2500 - $600 = $1900.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage.  The number of hours is $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours.


**Answer:** 126.67 hours.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

* Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
* The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"The tire's lifespan is determined by the number of rotations it undergoes.  We know that each tire rotates 725 times for every 2 miles driven.  

To calculate the number of years before the tire needs replacement, we need to consider the total rotations for the given mileage and the tire's capacity.

* **Total rotations for 400 miles:** 725 rotations/mile * 400 miles = 290,000 rotations
* **Total rotations per year:** 10,440,000 rotations/year
* **Years to replace tires:** 290,000 rotations / 10,440,000 rotations/year = 0.027 years

**Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after approximately 0.027 years, or about 1.1 months.**

"The total number of legs on the farm is 70, and the total number of heads is 20.  To determine the number of sheep, we can use the following logic:

* **Sheep:** Each sheep has 4 legs.
* **Geese:** Each goose has 2 legs.
* **Total Legs:** 4s + 2g = 70 
* **Total Heads:** s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using the following steps:

1. **Solve for 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation:**
   g = 20 - s

2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation:**
   4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 's':**
   4s + 40 - 2s = 70
   2s = 30
   s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"The question presents a classic age-related problem.  Let's break it down:

* We have a set of twins and a set of triplets.
* One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
* Their combined ages are 44.

To find the age of the twin, we can use the following logic:

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

Since the question states that the twin is 7 years older than the triplet, we can express this as:

* t = 3t - 7

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the combined ages:

* t + 3t = 44

Combining like terms:

* 4t = 44

Solving for 't':

* t = 44 / 4
* t = 11

Therefore, one of the twins is **11 years old**.

"The situation presents a complex economic dilemma.  While Ron is facing a significant financial burden, it's important to consider the long-term implications.  

The city council's refusal to address the pothole is a clear indication of a larger issue.  It suggests a systemic problem with road maintenance.  Ron's decision to fix the pothole himself, while incurring a fine, could be a strategic move to highlight the need for proper infrastructure investment.

"The overall pass rate is calculated by adding the pass rates of each grade level and then dividing by the total number of students. 

* Third grade: 340 students passed out of 500, giving a pass rate of 0.68 or 68%.
* Fourth grade: 40 students passed out of 100, giving a pass rate of 0.40 or 40%.
* Fifth grade: 400 students passed out of 500, giving a pass rate of 0.80 or 80%.

Adding the pass rates of each grade level, we get 0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80 = 1.88. 

To find the overall pass rate, we need to multiply this sum by 100 to express it as a percentage. 1.88 * 100 = 188%. 


**Therefore, the overall pass rate is 188%.**

"The problem states that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar.  This means we can represent the amounts of each ingredient with the following variables:

* **x:** Amount of zest
* **y:** Amount of salt
* **z:** Amount of sugar
* **o:** Amount of oil

We know the following:

* **x = fragrance**
* **y = 2x**
* **o = 2y**
* **y = z**
* **Total mixture = 10 ounces**

To find the amount of oil (o), we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since we know y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z.
2. **Substitute:** Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 2x.
3. **Solve:** We know that Tanya uses 10 ounces of the mixture. 

Let me know if you'd like me to continue solving for the amount of oil!

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we need to understand the relationship between the mountain's height and the lifting capacity of each individual.

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. 
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches. 
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the relationship between the ages of the siblings:
    *  The individual's age is represented by 'x'
    *  The brother's age is 'x + 3'
    *  The sister's age is 'x - 2'

* The mother's age is one less than three times the brother's age. This translates to: 
    *  Mother's age = 3(brother's age) - 1

* The sum of all their ages is 87.

* We can now express this mathematically:
    * x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

* Simplifying the equation:
    * 3x + 1 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
    * 6x + 9 = 87

* Solving for x:
    * 6x = 78
    * x = 13

* Therefore, the individual's age is 13.

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  

* Sofie's books: F - 12 + 25
* Anne's books: F - 12

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F: 
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects. 

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key is to recognize that the speed of the whirligig is directly proportional to the speed of the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob.

* **Calculating the Whirligig's Speed:**  We know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  Since the whatchamacallit is 11 times faster than the thingamabob, the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.  The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so it spins 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

To find the number of red and blue boxes left, we need to calculate the number of boxes used and then subtract that from the total number of boxes. 

* **Boxes used:** 3 blue boxes + (1/3) * 9 red boxes = 3 blue boxes + 3 red boxes = 6 boxes
* **Boxes left:** 9 red boxes - 6 boxes = 3 red boxes

"The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  To find Peter's age, we can use the following steps:

* **Let's represent the ages:**
    * Peter's age: P
    * Paul's age: P + 10
    * John's age: J

* **Set up an equation:**
    * P + (P + 10) + J = 100 

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We know that P = P + 10 + J. Substitute this into the equation: 2(P + 10 + J) + J = 100
    * Simplify and solve for J: 2P + 20 + 2J + J = 100
    * Combine like terms: 2P + 3J = 80
    * We can solve for J: J = (80 - 2P) / 3

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + ((80 - 2P) / 3)
    * Simplify and solve for P: 3P = 100 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 5P = 100
    * Solve for P: P = 20

**Therefore, Peter's age is 20 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the team scored a total of 45 points.  Bahati scored the most, and his score was 20 more than Azibo's and 10 more than Dinar's.  

To find Azibo's score, we can use the following steps:

1. **Let's represent the scores:**
   * Dinar's score: D
   * Azibo's score: A
   * Bahati's score: B

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * B = A + 20 
   * B = D + 10
   * A + D + B = 45

3. **Substitute to solve for A:**
   * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
     * D + 10 = A + 20
     * A = D - 10

4. **Substitute into the total points equation:**
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

5. **Simplify and solve for D:**
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

6. **Find Azibo's score (A):**
   * A = D - 10
   * A = 11.67 - 10
   * A = 1.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

* **Total Occupancy in 2 Weeks:**  With 50 patients admitted daily, in 2 weeks, the hospital will have 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients admitted.
* **Unoccupied Beds:**  The hospital has 1000 beds - 700 patients = 300 unoccupied beds.

"The audience size was likely overstated by a percentage.  To determine the actual number of attendees, we need to calculate the percentage of the overstatement. 

The overstatement is 20% of the original number, which is 48.  

To find the actual number of attendees, we can use the following formula:

Actual number of attendees = Original number of attendees * (1 - Percentage of overstatement)

Therefore, the actual number of attendees is 48 * (1 - 0.20) = 38.4. 

**Answer:** 38.4

"The problem states that two individuals will receive an equal share of the corn chips, and the remaining individual will receive 15 more than the others.  

Let's break it down:

* **Amora and Lainey:** They each receive 70 corn chips.
* **The remaining individual:**  They receive 15 more than the others, so we need to find the number of chips the others receive. 
* **Total chips:**  To find the total number of chips, we need to add the number of chips each person receives.

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 70 + 70 + 15 = 155.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are all Pokemon enthusiasts, and they've caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    *  We can use the first two equations to express 'S' in terms of 'A' and 'W'.  
    *  Substitute the first equation into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    *  Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    *  Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    *  Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    *  Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three legs: a southward flight, a northward flight, and a final southward flight.  

* **Southward Flight:** The bird travels 300 miles south at 30 miles per hour for 10 hours.
* **Northward Flight:** The bird travels 36 miles north at 18 miles per hour for 2 hours.
* **Southward Flight:** The bird travels 110 miles south at 22 miles per hour for 5 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances of each leg. 

**Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles**

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.

"To determine the number of slats needed, we need to consider the perimeter of the rectangular garden.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by: 2 * (length + width).

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.  Therefore, the perimeter is: 2 * (15 feet + 10 feet) = 50 feet.

Since Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, he will need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

"The flower bed is 111 feet long, which is equal to 1332 inches.  To determine the number of plants Pat can fit, we need to consider the spacing between each plant.  Each plant requires 1.5 feet of space.  

To calculate the number of plants, we divide the total length of the bed by the spacing between plants: 1332 inches / 1.5 feet/plant = 888 plants.

Since Pat already owns 17 plants, she needs to purchase 888 - 17 = 871 more plants.

To calculate the total cost, we multiply the number of plants she needs to buy by the price per plant: 871 plants * $6/plant = $5226.

"The comet's orbital period is 75 years.  To determine Bill's age when he first saw the comet, we need to consider the time elapsed since his father's observation. 

* **Bill's father saw the comet at age 30.**
* **Bill saw the comet a second time at age 90.**

The time difference between these two observations is 90 - 30 = 60 years. 

Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we can calculate Bill's age when he first saw the comet by subtracting the time elapsed from his second observation from the time elapsed since his father's observation. 

Therefore, Bill was **15 years old** when he first saw the comet.

"The watermelon is divided into slices, and each adult gets a slice that is twice the size of a child's slice.  To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to determine the size of a child's slice. 

Let's assume each child's slice is represented by 'x'.  The adult's slice is then 2x.  

The total number of slices is 6, representing 2 adults and 4 children.  

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can use the following formula:

(2x / 6) * 100%

"The problem states that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

"Grandpa's jelly bean consumption is a classic example of ratio and proportion.  

* **Large beans:** 75 beans represent a base quantity.
* **Medium beans:**  He eats twice the number of medium beans as large beans, meaning he consumes 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.
* **Small beans:**  We can express the relationship between small and medium beans as a ratio.  Since 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium bean, we can say that 1 small bean is equal to 1/3 of a medium bean.  

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 150 / 3 = 50 small beans.

"Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food per feeding.  To determine how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption.  

The cats consume 60 grams per feeding, and she feeds them twice a day, so the total daily consumption is 60 grams/feeding * 2 feedings = 120 grams.

To find out how many days the 720 grams will last, we divide the total cat food by the daily consumption: 720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days.

Therefore, the 720 grams of cat food will last Imma's cats for **6 days**.

x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.

Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"The problem states that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  Let's represent Sam's portion with the variable 'x'.  Harry's portion is then 'x + 60'.  

To find the amount of fencing left for Sam, we need to find the difference between the total fencing and Harry's portion. 

The equation is:

"Let's break down the problem. We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  We can represent this as:

*  Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56

Since they painted the same number, we can represent this as:

*  x + x = 56

This simplifies to:

*  2x = 56

Solving for x, we find:

*  x = 28

Now, let's consider Camden and Sarah. We know they painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent this as:

*  Sarah's eggs + (Sarah's eggs + 12) = 30

Simplifying this equation:

*  2y + 12 = 30

Solving for y:

*  2y = 18
*  y = 9

Now, we know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Therefore, we can represent this as:

*  Camden's eggs = Sarah's eggs + 12
*  Camden's eggs = 9 + 12
*  Camden's eggs = 21

Finally, we can find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:

*  Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs = 21 - 28
*  Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs = -7


**Answer:**  Camden painted 7 fewer eggs than Arnold.

"The problem states that Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes she makes in brownies.  Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'.  We can express this mathematically as:

* b = 3c - 2

We know that the total number of treats for the class is 10.  Since each person gets 2 treats, we can set up an equation:

* 2c + 2b = 10

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* 2c + 2(3c - 2) = 10

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* 2c + 6c - 4 = 10
* 8c - 4 = 10
* 8c = 14
* c = 1.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a cupcake, we need to re-evaluate the problem.  The problem is not well-defined.

"The tower has 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks.  The total number of blocks is 32.  To find the number of red blocks, we can use the following equation:

Total blocks = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks

32 = 4 + 8 + Red blocks

Solving for Red blocks:

Red blocks = 32 - 4 - 8 = 20

Therefore, there are **20** red blocks in the tower.

"The boat depreciates by a percentage each year.  This is a common pattern in depreciation calculations.  

* **Year 1:**  The boat depreciates 30% of its initial value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  The boat's value after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  The boat depreciates another 30% of its value from the previous year, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  The boat's value after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  The boat depreciates 20% of its value from the previous year, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's value after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"The bag contains 232 candies, with 54 red candies.  The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which is 54 * 2 = 108.  The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which is 54 / 2 = 27.  The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.  Therefore, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"The quilt will be made from 11 small t-shirts, 8 medium t-shirts, and 6 large t-shirts.  The area of each shirt is given as follows:

* Small: 3 square feet
* Medium: 4 square feet
* Large: 6 square feet

To calculate the total area of the quilt, we need to sum the areas of all the shirts:

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Adding these together, we get: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet.

Therefore, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

"The problem presents a classic animal population scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To find the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations.  

**Solving for 'c'**

1. **Solve for 'w' in the first equation:**
   w = 20 - c

2. **Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
   2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   2c + 80 - 4c = 70
   -2c = -10
   c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
