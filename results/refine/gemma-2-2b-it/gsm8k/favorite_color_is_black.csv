"The original price of the book can be determined by applying a simple linear equation.  Let 'x' represent the original price.  We know that the discount is 25% of the original price, which translates to 0.25x.  

Subtracting the discount from the sale price of $19.50, we can set up the equation:

x - 0.25x = $19.50

Simplifying the equation:

0.75x = $19.50

Solving for x:

x = $19.50 / 0.75

Therefore, the original price of the book is:

x = $26.00

"The problem presents a classic cost analysis scenario.  We know the cost of a single blue tie is $40.  To determine the cost of a red tie, we need to consider the price markup.  Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

*  Red tie cost = Blue tie cost * 1.50 
*  Red tie cost = $40 * 1.50 = $60

To determine the total cost of the red ties, we need to consider the number of red ties purchased.  The problem states that John purchased 10 red ties.  Therefore, the total cost of the red ties is:

* Total red tie cost = 10 * $60 = $600

Finally, to determine the total cost of all ties, we need to consider the cost of the blue ties.  The problem states that John purchased 5 blue ties.  Therefore, the total cost of all ties is:

* Total tie cost = 5 * $40 = $200

The total cost of all ties is $200 + $600 = $800.

"The ratio of sugar to water in Katy's coffee preparation is 7:13.  To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we can utilize the following:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:13 represents a fixed proportion between the two ingredients. 
* **Solving for the Unit Value:**  We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find the value of one part of the ratio, we can set up a proportion: 
    * 7x = 120 teaspoons
    * Solving for x, we get x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately).

Therefore, Katy used approximately 17.14 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

* Lylah's salary four years ago was calculated by knowing that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than hers.  We can use this information to find Lylah's salary. 

* To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can use the following equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30. 
* Solving for Lylah's salary, we get: $40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30. 
* Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).

* Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% to her previous salary: $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

* Finally, to find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we add their current salaries: $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The elves' attrition rate is a classic case of a Poisson process.  We can model this with a simple probability distribution.  

After the initial incident, the number of elves remaining is a function of the initial number of elves and the probability of an elf quitting.  The probability of an elf quitting is 20/60 = 1/3.  

The number of elves remaining after the second incident is then a function of the initial number of elves and the probability of an elf quitting.  The probability of an elf quitting is 1/3.  

Therefore, the number of elves remaining is 40 - 10 = 30.

"The problem states that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.  To solve for the number of pink gumballs, we can use the following equation:

Pink gumballs = (4 * Blue gumballs) + 22

We know there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Pink gumballs = (4 * 12) + 22

Pink gumballs = 48 + 22

Pink gumballs = 70

Therefore, there are **70** pink gumballs.

"The hive's population dynamics are fascinating.  We can determine the number of worker bees by understanding the relationship between the queen, baby bees, and worker bees. 

* **Queen:** The queen bee is the primary reproductive female, and her number is denoted by 'q'.
* **Baby Bees:** Baby bees are the offspring of the queen and are denoted by 'b'.
* **Worker Bees:** Worker bees are the industrious bees responsible for hive maintenance and foraging. Their number is denoted by 'w'.

The key to solving this problem is recognizing the relationship between these bee populations.  We know that:

* **w = 2b**  (The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees).
* **b = 2q** (The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens).

Let's use this information to find the number of worker bees.

**To find the number of worker bees, we can substitute the value of 'b' from the second equation into the first equation:**

w = 2 * (2q) = 4q

**Now, we know that the number of queens is 100 (q = 100).  Substituting this value into the equation for worker bees:**

w = 4 * 100 = 400

**Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'**
* **Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'**

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:**
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. **Now that we know Brooke's age (B), substitute it back into the equation S = 2B:**
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw distributed to the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:** 10 cages of hamsters are distributed with 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** 160 total pieces of straw are used, and 50 pieces are used for hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We need to divide the remaining straw (110 pieces) by the number of rats to find the number of rats per cage. 
* **Rat per Cage:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats. 
* **Rounding:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The trader's profit is a function of the price per bag, the number of bags sold, and the cost of transportation.  We can express this as a linear equation:

**Profit = (Price per bag * Number of bags sold) - (Cost per bag * Number of bags sold) - (Transportation cost per bag * Number of bags sold)**

We know the following:

* **Profit:** $400
* **Price per bag:** $30
* **Cost per bag:** $20
* **Transportation cost per bag:** $2

Let's substitute these values into the equation:

$400 = (30 * x) - (20 * x) - (2 * x)

Simplifying the equation:

$400 = 10x - 2x

$400 = 8x

Solving for x:

x = $400 / 8

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold **50** bags.

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving a direct relationship between the number of snails and fish.  Let's break it down:

* **Snails:** The difference in snails between the two aquariums is directly proportional to the number of fish.  
* **Fish:**  We need to find the number of fish that would create this difference.

To solve this, we can use the following equation:

* **Difference in snails = 2 * Number of fish**

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'.  We know the difference in snails is twice the number of fish.  

* **32 - 4 = 2 * x**

Simplifying the equation:

* **28 = 2 * x**

Solving for 'x':

* **x = 14**

Therefore, each aquarium has **14** fish.

"The task involves calculating the total time required to dig a specific number of holes.  

* **Small holes:**  Each hole requires 3 minutes of labor.  We need to calculate the total time for 30 small holes. 
* **Large holes:** Each large hole requires 10 minutes of labor. We need to calculate the total time for 15 large holes.

To find the total time, we can use the following formula:

Total Time = (Time per Small Hole * Number of Small Holes) + (Time per Large Hole * Number of Large Holes)

Total Time = (3 minutes/hole * 30 holes) + (10 minutes/hole * 15 holes)

Total Time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes

Total Time = 240 minutes

Finally, convert the total time from minutes to hours:

Total Time = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"Katerina's topaz necklaces are meticulously crafted, with a precise arrangement of gemstones.  To ensure a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design, she utilizes a strategic beading technique.  Each topaz gemstone is precisely positioned, and the space between them is filled with sterling silver beads.  The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the length of each topaz gemstone is one inch.  The length of each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch.  

To determine the number of sterling silver beads used, we can calculate the total length of the space between the gemstones.  The total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.  Subtracting this from the total necklace length, we get 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.  

The length of each bead is 0.25 inches.  Dividing the total length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead, we find that Katerina uses 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

"The car in the fast lane traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.  To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can utilize the relationship between distance, speed, and time.

The formula is:  *distance = speed * time*

We know the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane is 480 miles.  The car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the fast lane, which is 30 miles per hour.  

Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  We can set up the equation:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight:**  The flight cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so we can calculate it as follows: 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.

**Total Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

**Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650

**Gift Allocation:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students less than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x':** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.**

"Carver's age is a key factor in understanding the relationship between his age and his son's age.  We can use this information to determine the son's age. 

Let's represent Carver's son's age as ""s"".  We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age.  This translates to the equation: 

* Carver's age = 2s - 5

We also know that Carver is 45 years old.  We can substitute this into the equation:

* 45 = 2s - 5

Now, we can solve for ""s"":

* 50 = 2s
* s = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and then divide it by the service interval. 

* **Total distance traveled per day:** 675 miles (3 trips * 225 miles/trip)
* **Days between services:** 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, we need 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, the total stuffing needed is 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam possess is 5:6, representing a 11-part ratio.  To determine the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we can calculate the difference in popsicles based on the ratio. 

The total number of popsicles is 165, and the ratio of popsicles is 5:6.  Therefore, we can calculate the value of one ratio part as follows:

"The problem presents a classic system of equations to determine the number of camels and dromedaries in a herd.  

Let's break it down:

* **Heads:** The total number of heads is represented by the sum of camels and dromedaries. This can be expressed as:  *c + d = 180*
* **Bumps:**  The total number of bumps is represented by the sum of bumps from camels and dromedaries. This can be expressed as: *2c + d = 304*

To solve for the number of dromedaries (*d*), we can utilize the following steps:

1. **Isolate 'c' in the first equation:**
   * c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
   * 2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   * 360 - 2d + d = 304
   * 360 - d = 304

"Kenny needs to sell a sufficient number of cards to reach the $100 target for the amusement park ticket.  We can represent this as an equation:

* **Total Earnings = Number of Cards * Price per Card**

We know the price per card is $1.50.  We also know he has $50 in cash.  

* **$100 = x * $1.50**

Solving for x (the number of cards), we get:

* **x = $100 / $1.50 = 66.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round this number to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** Kenny started with approximately **67** cards.

"The caterer prepared enough hot dogs for 36 guests, assuming a standard serving of one per guest.  However, with 40 guests, the demand for a second hot dog is a logistical consideration.  

To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hot dog, we need to consider the total number of hot dogs prepared and the number of guests who wanted two. 

The caterer prepared 36 hot dogs, and 18 guests desired two hot dogs.  Therefore, 40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests did not receive a second hot dog.

"To determine the number of candy bars purchased, we must first calculate the total cost of the chips.  

The cost of the chips is $1.20, as George purchased 3 bags at $0.40 per bag.  

Subtracting the cost of the chips from George's total spending, we find that he had $4.95 remaining.

To determine the number of candy bars purchased, we divide the remaining funds by the cost per candy bar.  

$4.95 / $0.75 = 6.6. 

Since we cannot purchase fractions of candy bars, George purchased **6** candy bars.

"To determine the number of carrot sticks required for Matt's desired cookie consumption, we need to consider the relationship between carrot sticks and cookies.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Cookie Equation:**  The number of cookies Matt can have is half the number of carrot sticks consumed, plus two additional cookies for room cleaning. This can be represented as:  
   *  Cookies = 0.5 * Carrot Sticks + 2

* **Total Cookies:** Matt desires 5 cookies.

* **Solving for Carrot Sticks:**  We can substitute the cookie equation into the total cookie requirement:
   * 5 = 0.5 * Carrot Sticks + 2

* **Solving for Carrot Sticks:**
   * Subtract 2 from both sides: 3 = 0.5 * Carrot Sticks
   * Divide both sides by 0.5: 6 = Carrot Sticks

**Therefore, Matt must consume 6 carrot sticks to satisfy his cookie craving.**

"The problem presents a classic application of basic algebra.  We are given that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers, and 20 students do not.  This means that 1/4 of the students lack desktop computers.  

To find the total number of students, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the total number of students.
* We know: (3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x

Solving for 'x', we can simplify the equation:

* Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 3x - 80 = x
* Subtract 'x' from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
* Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

"The average highest temperature of these three countries can be determined by calculating the mean of their respective temperatures.  

To do this, we sum the highest temperatures and then divide the sum by the number of countries. 

The sum of the highest temperatures is: -48°F + 21°F + (-3°F) = -20°F.

The average highest temperature is: -20°F / 3 countries = -6.67°F. 

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -6.67°F.

"The optimal guest count for cost parity between the two venues is determined by finding the point where the total cost of each venue is equal.  

Let's analyze the cost breakdown:

* **Venue 1:**  A fixed cost of $200 is incurred regardless of the number of guests.  The additional cost per guest is $5.
* **Venue 2:** The cost is directly proportional to the number of guests, with a fixed base price of $25 per guest.

To find the point of equality, we can set the cost equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * x = $25 * x

Solving for x, the number of guests, we get:

$200 = $20 * x

Therefore, x = 10. 


**Answer:** 10 guests.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we need to break down the problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have: 5x/2 = 36

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 5x = 72

Dividing both sides by 5, we find: x = 14.4

Now, to find Lily's insects, we substitute the value of x back into the equation for Lily's insects: (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

"The couch's length is determined by the relationship between the rug's width and the couch's length.  

* The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, meaning the rug's width is 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.
* Twice the rug's width is 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet.
* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, so the couch is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet long. 

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"The cost of the candles is determined by the number of candles purchased.  Since James needs two candles for his sons, and each pack contains five candles, the total cost is determined by the number of packs needed.  

To determine the number of packs, we need to consider the age of the younger son.  The younger son is 4 years younger than the older son, so we can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of candles needed by the number of candles per pack. 

The total number of candles needed is 2.  The number of candles per pack is 5.  Therefore, the number of packs needed is 2 / 5 = 0.4.  Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, James needs to purchase 1 pack. 

The cost of one pack is $3.  Therefore, the total cost is $3.

"To determine the nephew's age, we can utilize a simple linear equation.  

Let 'x' represent the nephew's current age.  In seven years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This is because Shiloh's age in seven years will be three times the nephew's age in seven years.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3(x + 7) = 51

Solving for x:

1. 3x + 21 = 51
2. 3x = 30
3. x = 10

Therefore, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The food truck's net profit is $67.00. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost. 

* **Revenue:** The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $70.00.
* **Cost:** The cost of ingredients is $3.00 per sandwich, and the food truck sells 10 sandwiches, resulting in a total cost of $3.00.

Therefore, the net profit is calculated as:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Net Profit = $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00

"The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the jelly bean quantities.  Let's break it down:

* **Blue jelly beans:**  We know the jar contains a specific ratio of jelly beans.  Let's represent this ratio as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  The problem states there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue. This translates to (0.99)b red jelly beans.
* **Green jelly beans:**  The problem states there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue. This translates to (1.01)b green jelly beans.

**To find the number of jelly beans, we can use the following equation:**

b + (0.99)b + (1.01)b = 4500

**Solving for 'b':**

1. Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
2. Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: (1.01) * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: (0.99) * 1500 = 1495

**Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.**

"The beanstalk's growth pattern is exponential.  To determine the number of days it takes to reach the window, we need to find the day when the height surpasses the window's height.  

The beanstalk doubles its height each day.  Therefore, we need to determine the day when the height reaches 20 feet. 

* **Day 1:** 4 feet
* **Day 2:** 4 * 2 = 8 feet
* **Day 3:** 8 * 2 = 16 feet
* **Day 4:** 16 * 2 = 32 feet
* **Day 5:** 32 * 2 = 64 feet
* **Day 6:** 64 * 2 = 128 feet
* **Day 7:** 128 * 2 = 256 feet

The beanstalk will reach 20 feet on **Day 7**.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago, which is a fundamental concept in age-related calculations.  

To determine Jerry's age in three years, we need to consider his current age and the rate of change in his age.  

Let's analyze the given information:

* **Current age:**  Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago. 

* **Age five years ago:**  Jerry's age five years ago is represented by the variable ""x - 5"".

* **Age in three years:**  To find Jerry's age in three years, we need to add three to his current age.

Therefore, Jerry's age in three years will be:

* **x + 3**

We can express this as:

* **x + 3 = 2(x - 5) + 3**

Solving for x:

* **x + 3 = 2x - 10 + 3**
* **x + 3 = 2x - 7**
* **10 = x**

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

In three years, Jerry will be:

* **10 + 3 = 13 years old**

"The angles in a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"Ariadne's sales data reveals a clear pattern.  Her red hat sales were $400, representing 50% of her total earnings.  To determine her total earnings for two months, we need to consider the relationship between her sales in the first and second month.  

The second month's sales were 3/4 of the first month's sales, indicating a proportional increase.  

Therefore, we can calculate the total earnings for the two months as follows:

* **Month 1:** $400 (red hats) + $200 (green hats) = $600
* **Month 2:** (3/4) * $600 = $450

The total earnings for the two months are $600 + $450 = $1050.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This can be expressed as s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Substituting this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplifying and solving for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Now, substitute the value of 'g' back into Equation 2 to find 's': s + 5 = 20  =>  s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Based on the established relationship between potatoes and hash browns, we can deduce the following:

* **Direct Proportionality:** The number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

* **Scaling:**  To determine the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the established ratio. 

* **Calculation:**  
   *  The ratio of hash browns to potatoes is 36 hash browns : 6 potatoes.
   *  To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion: 
      * 36 hash browns / 6 potatoes = x hash browns / 96 potatoes
   *  Solving for x:
      * 36 * 96 = 6 * x
      * 3456 = 6x
      * x = 3456 / 6
      * x = 576

**Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.**

"The price of the crate of fruit can be determined by analyzing the individual fruit costs. 

* **Apples:**  Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  Bananas cost twice as much as apples, so they cost $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Oranges are three times more expensive than bananas, costing $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we sum the cost of each fruit type:

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we can break down the problem using a systematic approach. 

Let's represent the quantities as follows:

* **Zest:**  x ounces
* **Salt:**  y ounces
* **Sugar:**  y ounces
* **Oil:**  o ounces

We know the following:

* **Zest = Fragrance:**  This means the amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.

"The problem presents a classic linear equation to solve for Becca's card count.  Let's break it down:

* **Define Variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ possesses.
    *  Smendrick's collection is 3 times PJ's, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca's collection is 12 more than Smendrick's, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Formulate the Equation:**
    * The total number of cards is 341, so: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341
    * Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
    * Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

* **Determine Becca's Cards:**
    * Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"The problem presents a simple scenario of apple slicing and consumption.  

To determine the number of apple slices remaining, we must first calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.  

* Large apples: 3 apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices
* Small apples: 5 apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices
* Total slices: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices

Subtracting the consumed slices from the total slices, we find: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices. 

Therefore, 15 slices remain.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Jack's socks:**  We know Jack has 60 dishes, and this represents a key relationship in the problem.  
* **Jack's socks and dishes:**  We are given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. This means the number of socks is directly related to the number of dishes.
* **Peter's socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* **Total socks:** Peter and Jack have a total of 60 + 30 = 90 socks.
* **Total dishes:** Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 60 socks, so they have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dishes.

"To determine your age, we can use a system of equations based on the given information.  Let's represent your age as 'x'.  Your brother's age is 'x + 3', and your sister's age is 'x - 2'.

The key to solving this is understanding the relationship between your brother's age and your mother's age.  Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age.  This translates to the following equation:

* Mother's age = 3(Brother's age) - 1

Now, let's combine all the information into a single equation:

* x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

Simplifying the equation:

* 3x + 1 = 87

Solving for 'x':

* 3x = 86
* x = 28

Therefore, you are 28 years old.

"To determine the number of books Fawn possesses, we can employ a systematic approach.  

Let's break down the given information:

* **Sofie's books:**  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
* **Anne's books:** Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

We can represent this mathematically as:

* Fawn's books (F) =  *x*
* Anne's books = *x - 12*
* Sofie's books = *x - 12 + 25*

The total number of books is the sum of these three:

* F + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation:

* 3x + 13 = 85

Solving for *x*:

* 3x = 72
* x = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the initial cost of the chickens, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens sold.  

* **Profit:** Isaias aims for a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** Each chicken is sold for $50.
* **Chickens Sold:** He plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

To calculate the initial cost, we can use the following formula:

**Total Revenue = Number of Chickens Sold * Selling Price**

Therefore, the total revenue generated from the sale is: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Subtracting the profit from the total revenue, we can determine the initial cost:

**Initial Cost = Total Revenue - Profit**

Initial Cost = $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

**Answer:** Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"The problem states that Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade and the boys sold an equal number.  To determine the difference in glasses sold, we can calculate the number of glasses Micah sold.  Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can find the difference by subtracting Julie's sales from the total number of glasses sold. 

The total number of glasses sold is 32.  Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number, so the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  

To find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales, we subtract Julie's sales from Micah's sales.  This gives us 18 - 14 = 4.

"The problem states that Melanie's age in 10 years will be 18.  This implies that her current age is 8.  To determine the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age, we can set up an equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.
*  Melanie's age in 'x' years: 8 + x
*  Her age will be thrice her present age: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for 'x':
* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can utilize the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

The relationship between the speeds of the objects can be represented as follows:

* Thingamabob speed =  x meters per second
* Whatchamacallit speed = 11x meters per second
* Whirligig speed = 5 * (11x meters per second) = 55x meters per second

Since we know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second, we can solve for x:

121 meters per second = 11x meters per second
x = 121 meters per second / 11
x = 11 meters per second

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 * 11 = **555 meters per second**.

"To determine Peter's age, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, P+10, and J respectively.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:** P + P + J = 100 (The sum of their ages equals 100)
* **Equation 2:** P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages)

From Equation 2, we can isolate J: J = P - P - 10 = -10.  

Substituting this value of J into Equation 1:

P + P + (-10) = 100

Combining like terms: 2P - 10 = 100

Adding 10 to both sides: 2P = 110

Dividing both sides by 2: P = 55

Therefore, Peter's age is 55.

"To determine Azibo's score, we can utilize the given information and apply a strategic approach. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Bahati's score:**  We know Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.  This implies a direct relationship between their scores.
* **Azibo's score:**  We can express Azibo's score as a function of Dinar's score. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar: D
* Azibo: A
* Bahati: B

We can then set up an equation based on the total points:

A + D + B = 45

Now, we can substitute the known relationships between the scores:

A = D - 10
B = A + 20

Substituting these into the total points equation:

(D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplifying the equation:

3D + 10 = 45

Solving for D:

3D = 35
D = 11.67 (approximately)

Now, we can find Azibo's score:

A = D - 10
A = 11.67 - 10
A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"The Smith family requires a comprehensive approach to pool filling.  First, we must determine the pool's volume.  

Volume = length x width x depth
Volume = 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

To accurately calculate the gallons needed, we must convert cubic feet to gallons.  

1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons
Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
Volume in gallons = 10392 gallons

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.  

Cost = Volume in gallons x price per gallon
Cost = 10392 gallons x $0.10/gallon
Cost = $1039.20

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is $1039.20.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  To calculate the value in 2010, we need to consider the depreciation rate and the initial value. 

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.  

The value of the car in 2010 is calculated as follows:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"Let's analyze the problem.  We know the total cooking time was 98 minutes.  We also know that Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  

To find the duration of Donovan's portion, we can represent it as 'x'.  Betsy's portion, therefore, took 'x + 18' minutes.

The sum of both portions equals the total cooking time: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for x:
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.  Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"The problem presents a classic linear equation.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.**

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

* **x + (x + 60) = 100**

Solving for 'x', we get:

* **2x + 60 = 100**
* **2x = 40**
* **x = 20**

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To determine the amount left for Sam, we subtract Harry's share from the total fence:

* **Sam's leftover fence = 100 - 80 = 20 feet**

"The problem presents a classic case of simultaneous equations.  Let's break it down:

*  We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 2x eggs.
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 2y + 12 eggs.
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56.

To solve for the unknowns, we can use a system of equations.  

Let's represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as 'x'.  We can then represent the number of eggs painted by Sarah as 'y'.

*  We know that x + x = 2x, which means Arnold and Madeline painted a total of 2x eggs.
*  We also know that y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12, which means Camden and Sarah painted a total of 2y + 12 eggs.
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56, so 2x + (2y + 12) = 56.

Solving for 'x' and 'y' is straightforward.  We can substitute the value of 'y' from the second equation into the first equation to get:

*  2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
*  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
*  Combining like terms, we get: 56 = 56.

This equation is true for any value of 'x' and 'y'.  

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we can simply subtract the number of eggs painted by Arnold from the number of eggs painted by Camden. 

**Answer:**  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"The avocado tree's fruit production exhibits a clear pattern of exponential growth.  

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree produces a consistent yield of 50 fruits per year.
* **Year 6-8:**  The production increases by a factor of 3, then 7, and then 200 less than the 10-year-old tree. 
* **Year 9:**  The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:**  The tree produces 20 times the initial yield.

To calculate the total fruit production, we need to consider the production of each year. 

**Total fruit production:** 
* Year 1-5: 50 fruits/year * 5 years = 250 fruits
* Year 6: 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits
* Year 7: 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits
* Year 8: 350 fruits - 200 fruits = 150 fruits
* Year 9: 0 fruits
* Year 10: 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits

**Total: 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits**

"The problem presents a classic linear equation scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
    *  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(y - 7)' cm long.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    The total length of the three ropes is 37 cm, so:
    y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve the equation:**
    1. y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    2. 6y - 35 = 37
    3. 6y = 72
    4. y = 12

* **Determine the length of the red rope:**
    The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so:
    Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 cm.

"The problem presents a classic case of a recursive apple-related scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Initial State:** 2 apples fall from the tree.
* **First Throw:**  The initial throw of one apple into the tree causes a cascade effect, resulting in 5 more apples falling.
* **Second Throw:**  The subsequent throw of the remaining apple causes another 6 apples to fall.

The key to solving this is recognizing the pattern.  Newton's actions are a series of cascading events.  The number of apples falling is directly proportional to the number of apples thrown.  

Therefore, the final number of apples Newton brings home is the sum of the apples that fell from the tree after each throw.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their respective water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, resulting in 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removal, we need to consider the duration of each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters** 


Therefore, the total water removed by the dehumidifier is **30 liters**.

"The problem requires a thorough understanding of volume calculations and packing efficiency.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the jar.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height.  In this case, the dimensions are 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches.  Therefore, the volume of the jar is:

* Volume = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we need to calculate the volume of the jelly beans.  The packing efficiency is a crucial factor in this calculation.  It is important to note that the packing efficiency is not a constant and can vary depending on the shape and arrangement of the jelly beans.  In this case, we are given an efficiency of 80%.  

The volume of the jelly beans is calculated as follows:

* Volume of jelly beans = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Finally, we can determine the number of jelly beans.  The number of jelly beans is calculated by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.  The volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.

* Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of jelly beans is:

* Difference = 2880 - 900 = 1980.

Therefore, Tim's estimate was **1980** jelly beans off.

"Carly's problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c' and the number of brownies as 'b'.  We know that the number of brownies is three times the number of cupcakes minus two.  

We can express this mathematically as:

* b = 3c - 2

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person receives two treats.  Therefore:

"The problem states that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes.  Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

6x = 120
x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  This translates to:

5 * 20 - 4 = 96

"The boat's value depreciates in a linear fashion, with each year's depreciation being 30% of the previous year's value.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"The question presents a straightforward color-based analysis of a candy bag.  

To determine the number of pink candies, we must first calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies.  

* Red candies: 54
* Orange candies: 2 * 54 = 108
* Yellow candies: 0.5 * 54 = 27

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.

"The problem presents a classic linear equation system.  We can solve for the number of chickens using a substitution method. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20**  (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'w' in the first equation, we get:
* w = 20 - c

Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:
* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'c':
* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
