"Josh's investment in the house is a classic case of a ""value-add"" scenario.  He's essentially adding value to the property through renovations.  

To determine his profit, we need to consider the total cost of the property and the value it now holds.  

* **Initial Investment:** $80,000
* **Repairs:** $50,000
* **Total Investment:** $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen.  

Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"To determine the number of wins, we can use a simple algebraic approach.  Let 'x' represent the number of games lost.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can express the number of wins as 'x + 8'.  The total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses, so we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Solving for 'x', we get 2x + 8 = 22.  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we find 2x = 14.  Dividing both sides by 2, we arrive at x = 7.  Therefore, the team won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's. This means Gerald's time is the baseline.
* **Calculating Gerald's Improvement:**  Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%.  This is a percentage increase, so we need to calculate the new time based on his original time.
* **Setting up the Equation:**  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation to represent Gerald's new time:
   x + 0.1x = 38

* **Solving for x:**  We can simplify the equation:
   1.1x = 38
   x = 38 / 1.1
   x = 34.55 (approximately)

* **Calculating Gerald's New Time:**  Gerald's new time is 34.55 seconds.


**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 34.55 seconds.

"To determine the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts, we first need to find the total number of girls.  

* We know there are 200 students total, and 80 of them are boys. 
* This leaves us with 200 - 80 = 120 girls.

Next, we need to find the number of girls who are part of the Girl Scouts. 
* We are given that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. 
* This means 120 girls * (2/3) = 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.

Finally, we can find the number of girls not in the Girl Scouts by subtracting the number of girls in the Girl Scouts from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40.

"Freda's tomato sauce recipe involves a specific volume reduction.  Since each can contains three tomatoes and the final sauce volume is 32 ounces, we can determine the number of tomatoes used. 

To calculate the number of tomatoes, we need to consider the volume reduction.  The sauce volume is reduced by half, meaning the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces. 

Therefore, Freda used 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans of tomatoes. 

The total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

"To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we need to understand the ratio of sugar to water.  The ratio is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

We know Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find the number of teaspoons, we can use the following equation:

*  7x = 120 teaspoons

Solving for x, we get:

*  x = 120 teaspoons / 7 = 17.14

This means Katy used approximately 17.14 parts of the ratio.  

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we can multiply the value of one part of the ratio by the total number of teaspoons:

*  17.14 parts * 120 teaspoons = 205.68 teaspoons

Therefore, Katy used approximately **205.68** teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

To find Lylah's salary, we need to consider the relationship between their salaries.  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can use the following equation:

* Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30

We can solve for Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.30:

* Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Now, let's calculate Lylah's salary four years later:

* Lylah's salary now = $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later:

* Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300

**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is represented by 'S' and Brooke's age is represented by 'B'.
* We are given that S = 2B, meaning Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* The sum of their ages in two years will be 28.

To find Seth's current age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = 2B, we can substitute this into the equation: 2B + B + 2 = 28
2. **Combine:** Combine the 'B' terms: 3B + 2 = 28
3. **Isolate B:** Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
4. **Solve for B:** Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**


**Final answer: 17.34**

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw distributed to the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:**  The 10 hamster cages each have 5 pieces of straw, totaling 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** The 160 pieces of straw used are distributed among the rodents, with 110 pieces used for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used for rats by the number of pieces of straw each rat receives: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.
* **Rat Per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"Elaine's Pokemon collection is a fascinating study in growth!  Let's break down her collection progression:

* **Month 1:**  She starts with 20 cards and adds 3 times that amount, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:**  She then adds 20 fewer cards than in Month 1, so she acquires 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 3:**  In the third month, she doubles the total from the first two months, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  She then adds another 200 cards, bringing her total to 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Therefore, Elaine's collection now stands at a total of 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = **320** cards.

"The cost of a dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of half a dozen plates:**  Each plate costs $6000, and a dozen is 12, so the cost is $6000 * 6 = $36000.
* **Cost of twenty dozen cups:**  The cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.
* **Cost per cup:**  To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

**Therefore, the cost of buying each cup is $145.**

"The problem presents a classic chicken-egg scenario!  Let's break it down to find the number of red chickens.

We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42.  We also know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.  

Let's use the following variables:

*  'r' represents the number of red chickens.
*  'w' represents the number of white chickens.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  3r + 5w = 42  (total eggs produced)
*  r = w + 2   (number of white chickens is 2 more than red chickens)

To solve for 'r', we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

* 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

Simplify and solve for 'w':

* 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* 8w + 6 = 42
* 8w = 36
* w = 4.5

Since we can't have half a chicken, there is an error in the problem statement.  

**Answer:** The problem is flawed.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
    * The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
    * Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, resulting in a total loss of 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
    * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, meaning it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
    * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
    * We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This translates to the following equation: 8x = 4(x - 16)

* **Solve for x:**
    * 8x = 4x - 64
    * 4x = -64
    * x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which indicates an error in the problem setup.  

**Final answer:**  The problem is inconsistent and cannot be solved as written.

"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the fact that their ages will increase by the same amount in the future. 

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:** Zack is half of Harriet's age, so Zack is 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

**Calculating the average age in three years:**

* **Future age of Harriet:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old in three years.
* **Future age of Adrian:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old in three years.
* **Future age of Zack:** Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old in three years.

**Average age:** (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5 years.

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use a strategic approach.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Total Players:** The team has 105 members in total.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.  

Since the offense has twice the number of players as the defense, we can express the number of players on offense as 2x.  

Similarly, the number of players on special teams is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of players:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Combining like terms:

(5/2)x + x = 105

Simplifying:

(7/2)x = 105

Solving for x:

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

"The party began with 40 individuals, a balanced mix of 25 men and 15 women.  After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of attendees departed.  This equates to 10 individuals leaving.  

To determine the remaining number of women, we must first calculate the total number of women at the party.  The initial number of women was 15.  

Therefore, 5 women remain at the party.

"To determine the number of boxes needed, we need to consider the total number of pencils and the number of pencils each individual has. 

Jam has 24 pencils, and we know that each box holds 12 pencils.  Therefore, Jam has 24 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 2 boxes. 

Meg has 46 pencils.  To determine the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we need to consider the total number of pencils and the number of pencils each individual has. 

Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is 2 boxes (Jam) + 1 box (Meg) = 3 boxes.

"The coffee's weakening is a function of both the cooling effect of the ice and the addition of cream.  

* **Cooling effect:**  The ice cubes cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
* **Weaker coffee:**  Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
* **Total weakening:** 65 degrees * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters
* **Adding cream:** The cream adds 15 milliliters of weakening.
* **Final weakening:** 780 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 795 milliliters

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is **795 milliliters** weaker.

"The problem presents a classic trade-off scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Trade Ratio:** The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means for every 2 old records traded, 1 new record is obtained.
* **Total Records:**  We know 5 people traded records, and they left with 7 new records. 
* **Solving for the Number of Old Records:**  We can use this information to find the number of old records brought in. 

**The key is to understand that the number of new records traded is directly related to the number of old records traded.** 

Let me know if you'd like to explore other scenarios or have more record-trading puzzles!

"The key to this problem is understanding the flow of passengers.  We know that 20 people were on the bus at the third stop.  We also know that 7 people got off at the second stop, and 8 more got on.  This means that the number of people on the bus at the second stop was 11.  To find the number of people who got on at the terminal, we need to subtract the number of people who got off at the second stop from the total number of people on the bus at the third stop.  This gives us 20 - 7 + 8 = 21.  Therefore, 6 people got on the bus at the terminal.

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate.  Let's analyze the two options:

**Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Tax:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**

* **Net Income After Property Tax:** $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* **Tax:** $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
* **Net Pay:** $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B.**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x':** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = 60.**

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's break down the cost:

* **Mini-golf:**  $5 per person * number of friends
* **Go-karts:** $10 per ride * number of rides

To stay within her $90 budget, we need to find the maximum number of friends she can invite while keeping the cost of mini-golf and go-karts within the budget. 

**Here's how to solve for the number of friends:**

1. **Calculate the cost of mini-golf:**  $5 * number of friends
2. **Calculate the cost of go-karts:** $10 * number of rides

"Billy's purchase can be analyzed through a cost-benefit analysis.  We know the candy cost $1.50 per pound, and he spent $0.20 on gumballs.  To determine the number of pounds of candy purchased, we can use the following equation:

**Total Cost = Price per Pound * Number of Pounds**

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of pounds:

**Number of Pounds = Total Cost / Price per Pound**

We know the total cost is $9.80, and the price per pound is $1.50.  Therefore:

**Number of Pounds = $9.80 / $1.50 = 6.53 pounds**

**Answer:** Billy bought approximately 6.53 pounds of candy.

"The train's operational requirements are straightforward.  It travels a total of 225 miles per trip, and it needs service every 18,000 miles.  

To determine the number of days between services, we can calculate the total distance traveled in a day and then divide that by the service interval. 

The train travels 675 miles per day.  

Therefore, the number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days. 

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"Millie's lemonade stand is a classic example of a simple business model.  To maximize profit, we need to analyze her cost structure and revenue generation. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Cost:** Millie's initial investment of $18 covers the cost of supplies. This is a fixed cost, meaning it doesn't change regardless of the number of cups sold.
* **Revenue:**  Millie sells 144 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup, generating a total revenue of $144.
* **Profit:**  Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost.  

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is $144 - $18 = $126.

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To determine his initial land holdings, we can use a simple proportion.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.  We know that:

(3/5)x represents the amount of land sold.

The remaining land is represented by:

(2/5)x

We are given that (2/5)x = 12.8 hectares.  

Solving for x:

* Multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 32 hectares of land.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a 11-part ratio.  To determine the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we can calculate the difference in popsicles based on the ratio. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one ratio part by dividing the total popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts of the ratio, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.  Sam has 6 parts of the ratio, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.  

The difference in popsicles between Sam and Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel's energy consumption is a prime example of optimizing energy usage.  By reducing his AC usage by 5 hours, he can significantly reduce his energy bill.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:**  Mel's AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours daily. This translates to 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours.
* **Reduced Daily Energy Consumption:**  With a 5-hour reduction, his daily energy use drops to 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours.
* **Energy Savings:**  The difference in energy consumption is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.
* **Total Energy Savings in 30 Days:**  Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-Hour Conversion:**  135,000 watt-hours is equivalent to 135 kWh.

"The question presents a classic probability problem.  We need to determine the number of candles that are both defective and explode. 

We know that 5% of the candles are defective, and 99% are not.  This means that the probability of a candle being defective is 0.05, and the probability of a candle not being defective is 0.95.

To find the number of candles that are both defective and explode, we need to consider the following:

* **Defective candles:** 5% of 50,000 candles = 2,500 candles
* **Exploding defective candles:**  We are given that 5% of the defective candles are also exploding. 

Therefore, the number of candles that are both defective and explode is 2,500.

* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to determine the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"To determine the optimal guest count for cost equivalence between the two venues, we need to analyze the cost structure for each option. 

Let's break down the cost for each venue:

**Venue 1:**  The fixed cost is $200, regardless of the number of guests.  The additional cost for food is $5 per guest.

**Venue 2:** The cost is a flat fee of $25 per guest, with food already included.

To find the point of equality, we need to find the number of guests where the total cost of each venue is the same.

**Setting up the equation:**

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** $200 + $5x = $25x
* **Venue 2:** $25x

**Solving for x:**

* $200 + $5x = $25x
* $200 = $20x
* x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are required for the two venues to be cost-equivalent.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Bodhi's insects:**  We know Bodhi found 'x' insects.
* **David's insects:** David found half of Bodhi's insects, so he found x/2 insects.
* **Lily's insects:** Lily found 7 more than David, meaning she found (x/2) + 7 insects.

To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of insects each person found:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms: 
5x/2 + 7 = 43

Solving for x:
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects:
Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar contains a specific ratio of red, blue, and green jelly beans.  

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent this as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, we can represent this as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent this as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to find the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* **Green jelly beans:** 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* **Red jelly beans:** 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains **15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans**.

Let's represent Jerry's current age as ""x"".  Five years ago, he was ""x - 5"" years old.  We know that Jerry's current age is twice his age five years ago, so:

x = 2(x - 5)

Solving for x:

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 per implant * 2 implants = $4000. The additional cost of the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the total cost of the dental work. His hourly wage is $15 per hour.  Therefore, the number of hours he needs to work is $4500 / $15 per hour = 300 hours.

"The angles in a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the number of days it takes Prince to sell the bull's meat, we need to consider his daily meat production rate and the bull's weight. 

Prince sells 15 kilograms of meat per hour, and he works 10 hours per day.  Therefore, he can sell 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg of meat per day.

The bull weighs 750 kg.  To find out how many days it will take to sell the entire bull's meat, we divide the bull's weight by Prince's daily meat sales: 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

"Jim has a 20-piece pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  We know Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school, and he's at school for 8 hours.  This means he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:**  He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:**  He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This means s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplify and solve for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g to find 's': s = 20 - 5 => s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

We know that Janey has 3 more books than twice the number Sally has.  This translates to the following equation: 2 * Sally's books + 3 = Janey's books.

We are given that Janey has 21 books.  Let's substitute this into the equation: 2 * Sally's books + 3 = 21.

"Based on the established relationship between potatoes and hash browns, we can determine the number of hash browns produced from 96 potatoes.  

The key is understanding the proportionality.  If 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

Therefore, to find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6 * x = 36 * 96
* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

* **Cookie Monster's cookies:** Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. 
* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

"The price of the crate of fruit can be determined by analyzing the individual fruit costs. 

* **Apples:**  Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  Each banana costs twice the price of an apple, so it costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Each orange costs three times the price of a banana, so it costs $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we sum the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00

"The council's vote on the new regulation was a classic example of a balanced system.  Since the number of votes in favor was twice the number of votes against, we can represent this as a ratio.  

Let 'x' represent the number of votes against the regulation.  The number of votes in favor would then be 2x.  The total number of votes is the sum of these two values, which is x + 2x = 33.

"The arcade charges $0.25 per game.  To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of games played. 

* **Jack's playtime:** 240 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 12 games
* **Friend 1's playtime:** 120 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 6 games
* **Friend 2's playtime:** 60 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 3 games
* **Friend 3's playtime:** 360 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 18 games

**Total games played:** 12 + 6 + 3 + 18 = 39 games

**Total cost:** 39 games * $0.25/game = $9.75

"Let's break down the problem to determine the optimal oil quantity for Tanya's salt scrub.

**Understanding the Ratios:**

* **Zest and Fragrance:** Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, meaning they are equal quantities.
* **Salt and Sugar:**  Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
* **Oil and Salt:** Tanya uses twice the amount of oil as salt.

**Solving for the Variables:**

To find the amount of oil, we need to determine the value of 'x' (zest), 'y' (salt), and 'z' (sugar).  

* **Let's use the information we have to set up equations:**
    *  x = zest
    *  y = 2x 
    *  o = 2y 
    *  z = y 
    *  10 ounces = total mixture

**Finding the Amount of Oil (o):**

*  Since we know that 'o' is twice the amount of 'y', we can substitute 'y' with '2x' to find the amount of oil. 
*  We can then substitute 'z' for 'y' to find the amount of oil.

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to analyze the relationship between the cards held by each individual.  

Let's break it down:

* **PJ's cards:**  PJ has 'x' cards.
* **Smendrick's cards:** Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so he has 3x cards.
* **Becca's cards:** Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. 


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Milly's return will result in a loss of $21.00.  

Here's why:

* **Shipping Cost:** The shipping company charges a base rate of $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, and the return trip is 20 miles.  The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.
* **Refund:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's original price, which was $32.  The refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.
* **Final Loss:** The total cost Milly will incur is $3.00, and the refund is $24.00.  Therefore, Milly will lose $24.00 - $3.00 = $21.00.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical trend.  We can analyze this by breaking down his production over the first three weeks:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars

To determine the production for week 4, we need to consider the total production for the first three weeks.  

* **Total Production (Weeks 1-3):** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Subtracting the total production from his monthly output, we can determine the production for week 4:

* **Week 4 Production:** 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

**Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars in week 4.**

* **Chandeliers:** 2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00
* **Pictures:** 20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Therefore, we can calculate Naruto's lifting capacity by considering the relationship between the mountain heights. 

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.  
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can use the following equation:

Naruto's lifting capacity = 10 * Kagiyami's lifting capacity

Therefore, Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 * 48 inches = 480 inches.

Finally, we convert Naruto's lifting capacity to feet:

Naruto's lifting capacity in feet = 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = **40 feet**

"Let's break down the problem using a systematic approach:

* **Age Relationships:** We know the ages of the siblings are related by a specific pattern.  
    *  The individual's age is determined by the relationship between the siblings.
    *  The relationship between the siblings is a linear function.
* **Age of the Mother:** The mother's age is directly related to the brother's age. 
    *  The mother's age is one less than three times the brother's age.

**Solving for the Ages:**

*  Let's represent the brother's age as 'x'.
*  The sister's age is 'x - 2'.
*  The mother's age is '3x - 1'.

**Total Age:** The sum of their ages is 87.
*  x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

**Solving the Equation:**
*  3x + 1 = 87
*  3x = 86
*  x = 28

**Therefore, the brother's age is 28, and the sister's age is 26.**

"To determine the number of books Fawn possesses, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as ""F"".  We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  

* **Sofie's books:** F - 12 + 25
* **Anne's books:** F - 12

Therefore, the total number of books can be represented as: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation: 3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F: 
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

"To determine the initial cost of the chickens, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens sold.  

* **Profit:** Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** Each chicken is sold for $50.
* **Chickens Sold:** Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

To calculate the cost of the chickens, we can use the following formula:

**Total Revenue = Number of Chickens Sold * Selling Price**

* **Total Revenue:** 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000

Subtracting the profit from the total revenue gives us the initial cost:

**Initial Cost = Total Revenue - Profit**

* **Initial Cost:** $9000 - $2000 = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her current age, we can use a simple algebraic equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take.  

Melanie's age in 'x' years will be: 8 + x

We know that her age will be three times her current age, so:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Simplifying the equation:

8 + x = 24

Solving for 'x':

x = 24 - 8

x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"Kelly's grocery shopping trip presents a budgetary challenge.  Let's break down the costs:

* **Bacon:** 5 packs at $10 each equals $50.
* **Chicken:**  Each chicken packet costs twice the price of bacon, so a pack costs $10 * 2 = $20.  She has 6 packets, totaling $20 * 6 = $120.
* **Strawberries:** 3 packs at $4 each cost $4 * 3 = $12.
* **Apples:** 7 packs at $2 each cost $2 * 7 = $14.

The total cost of all items is $50 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $206.

Kelly has $65 remaining in her budget. 

**Therefore, Kelly is $206 - $65 = -$141 short of her budget.**

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can utilize the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

The relationship between the speeds of the objects is described by the following equation:

* **Whirligig Speed = 5 * Thingamabob Speed**

We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second.  To find the thingamabob's speed, we can use the following equation:

* **Thingamabob Speed = Whatchamacallit Speed / 11**

Substituting the known value of the whatchamacallit's speed, we get:

* **Thingamabob Speed = 121 meters per second / 11**

Solving for the thingamabob's speed, we get:

* **Thingamabob Speed = 11 meters per second**

Now, we can find the whirligig's speed by substituting the thingamabob's speed into the equation for whirligig speed:

* **Whirligig Speed = 5 * 11 meters per second**

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. 


**Answer:** 55 meters per second

    * John's age is 'J'

* **Formulate equations:**
    * The combined age is 100:  P + (P + 10) + J = 100

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use the given information and apply a strategic approach. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Bahati's score is 20 more than Azibo's and 10 more than Dinar's.** This means we can express Bahati's score as A + 20 and Dinar's score as D. 
* **The total points are 45.**  This means the sum of Bahati's, Azibo's, and Dinar's scores must equal 45.

Let's use the information to set up an equation:

* A + D + B = 45

We know:
* B = A + 20
* B = D + 10

Substituting these into the equation:

* A + D + (A + 20) = 45
* 2A + D + 20 = 45

Now, we can solve for D:

* 2A + D = 25
* D = 25 - 2A

We need to find a value for A that satisfies this equation.  

Since we know that A = D - 10, we can substitute this into the equation:

* 2(D - 10) + D = 25
* 2D - 20 + D = 25
* 3D - 20 = 25
* 3D = 45
* D = 15

Now that we know D, we can find A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 15 - 10
* A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in cooperative game theory.  We can solve this by understanding the concept of ""fair division.""  

Let's break it down:

* **Individual Shares:**  Amora and Lainey receive 70 chips each, totaling 70 + 70 = 140 chips.
* **The ""Extra"" Share:**  The remaining chips are distributed to the other two individuals.  
* **The Key:**  The key to solving this is to understand that the ""extra"" share is a function of the total number of chips. 

**Therefore, the total number of chips is 140 + 125 = 265.**

"The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, which is $400.  Therefore, the cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies.  

To calculate the cost of travel, we can set up an equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the cost of travel.
*  The cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies, so it's 1.50x.
*  The total cost of supplies and travel is $400.
*  Therefore, 400 = x + 1.50x

Solving for x, we get:

*  400 = 2.50x
*  x = 400 / 2.50
*  x = 160

"Let's analyze the Pokemon situation.  

We know Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 fewer than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.  

* **Let's represent the Pokemon caught by each:**
    * Alex: A
    * Stan: S
    * Adelwolfe: W

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 
    * S = 4W - 13
    * A + S + W = 339

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Marcus's chances of needing to turn in his homework are 8%.  

Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%
* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider his post-college earnings.  

* **Income Increase:**  His degree effectively quadruples his income, from $25,000 to $100,000 per year.
* **Total Earnings:** Over four years, he earns $100,000/year * 4 years = $400,000.
* **Total Loan Payments:**  He pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000 in loans.
* **Total Lost Income:**  He loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Total to Earn:**  To recoup his losses, he needs to earn $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

**Time to Earn:**  To earn $300,000, it would take Jim 300,000 / 100,000 = 3 years.

"The car's value depreciates by a constant 21% each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"James's insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  The normal monthly premium is $120.  To calculate his annual premium, we need to consider the increased cost.

The increased cost is 60% of the normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his annual premium is $120 + $72 = $192.

To determine his annual premium, we multiply the monthly premium by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

"Let's analyze the time allocation for this culinary collaboration.  

We know that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  This means we can represent Donovan's portion as 'x' minutes. Betsy's portion, therefore, took 'x + 18' minutes.  

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes.  We can express this mathematically as:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

2x = 80
x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.  Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"In a standard 24-hour period, a single spring can produce a significant number of jellyfish.  Considering the rate of jellyfish production, a five-spring system would generate a substantial number of jellyfish.  

To calculate the total jellyfish produced in four hours, we can use the following:

* **Jellyfish per spring per hour:** 60 seconds/second * 60 minutes/hour * 60 minutes/hour * 1 hour/hour = 216,000 jellyfish
* **Total jellyfish in 4 hours:** 216,000 jellyfish/spring * 5 springs = 1,080,000 jellyfish

Therefore, a five-spring system would produce **1,080,000** jellyfish in four hours.

"Let's break down this fence problem using a strategic approach. 

We know the total fence length is 100 feet.  Let's represent Sam's portion with 'x' and Harry's with 'x + 60'.  

The key is to set up an equation that represents the total fence length:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Solving for 'x':

2x = 40
x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find Harry's share, we simply add 60 feet to Sam's portion:

Harry's share = x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 feet

Finally, to determine the leftover fence for Sam, we subtract Harry's share from the total fence length:

Leftover fence for Sam = 100 - 80 = 20 feet


**Answer:** 20 feet

We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and 6 of these large jellyfish underwent the transformation.  This implies a direct relationship between the number of large jellyfish and the number of color-changing jellyfish.  

To determine the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following logic:

* **Large jellyfish:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of jellyfish.
* **Color-changing jellyfish:**  Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, we have (1/3) * x = 6.
* **Solving for x:**  Multiplying both sides by 3, we get x = 18.

Therefore, there are **18** jellyfish in the tank.

"Let's break down the problem using a strategic approach. 

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  This means we can represent their individual contributions as 'x' and 'x' respectively.  

Next, we need to consider the relationship between Camden and Sarah. We know they painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  This can be represented as 'y' and 'y + 12' respectively.

To find the number of eggs each person painted, we can use the following equations:

*  x + x = 2x (This represents the combined total of Arnold and Madeline's eggs)
*  y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12 (This represents the combined total of Camden and Sarah's eggs)

Solving for 'y' in the second equation, we get:

*  2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  2y = 44 - 2x
*  y = 22 - x

Now, we can substitute this value of 'y' back into the first equation:

*  x + x = 2x
*  2x = 56 - 2x
*  4x = 56
*  x = 14

Therefore, Arnold painted 14 eggs.

To find the number of eggs Camden painted, we can use the equation:

*  y + 12 = 2y + 12
*  y = 22 - x
*  y = 22 - 14
*  y = 8

Camden painted 8 eggs.

Finally, to determine the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we can subtract:

*  Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs = 8 - 14 = -6

Therefore, Camden painted 6 fewer eggs than Arnold. 


**Answer:** Camden painted 6 fewer eggs than Arnold.

"The red rope is the longest of the three, and we can determine its length by understanding the relationship between the other ropes.  

Let's break it down:

* **Yellow Rope:**  We know the yellow rope is the base length.
* **Blue Rope:** The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* **Red Rope:** The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use the following equation:

* Red Rope = 4 * (Blue Rope)

Now, let's substitute the value of the blue rope:

* Red Rope = 4 * (Yellow Rope - 7)

We know the total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  Therefore:

* Yellow Rope + Blue Rope + Red Rope = 37

Substituting the values we know:

* x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Solving for x:

* 6x - 35 = 37
* 6x = 72
* x = 12

Now, we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red Rope = 4 * (12 - 7)
* Red Rope = 4 * 5
* Red Rope = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is **20 centimeters**.

To determine the amount of red paint, we can use the following logic:

* **Yellow:** 6 pints
* **Red, White, and Purple:** 3 pints each
* **Total:** 6 pints + 3 pints + 3 pints = 12 pints

Therefore, the red paint represents 3 pints.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs, we need to consider the ratio of slices per pizza. 

* **Cheese pizza:**  Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
* **Pepperoni pizza:** Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.

Kate consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.  

To find the number of cheese pizzas, we divide the total cheese slices consumed by the slices per pizza: 6 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 0.5 pizzas.  

To find the number of pepperoni pizzas, we divide the total pepperoni slices consumed by the slices per pizza: 4 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 0.5 pizzas. 

Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to consider the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes.  

Let's represent the number of cupcakes as 'c'.  We know that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by the following equation:

* **b = 3c - 2**

This equation tells us that the number of brownies is three times the number of cupcakes minus 2.

We also know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person receives two treats.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

* **c + b = 10**

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation:

* **c + (3c - 2) = 10**

Simplifying the equation:

* **4c - 2 = 10**

Solving for 'c':

* **4c = 12**
* **c = 3**

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn popping pattern.  The initial burst of popping is due to the rapid heating of the kernels, followed by a period of exponential growth.  The rate of popping then slows down as the kernels reach a peak.  The final 30 seconds of popping represent a diminishing rate, and the residual heat will continue to pop kernels for a short period. 

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to calculate the total number of kernels popped in each stage:

* **Stage 1:** 20 kernels
* **Stage 2:** 3 * 20 = 60 kernels
* **Stage 3:** 4 * 60 = 240 kernels
* **Stage 4:** 240 / 2 = 120 kernels

The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels.

"Elvis's journey presents a classic case of vector addition.  

* **Westward:**  He travels 90 miles due west, a distance we can represent as a vector with a magnitude of 90 and a direction of -180 degrees.
* **Eastward:** He travels 144 miles due east, a distance we can represent as a vector with a magnitude of 144 and a direction of 0 degrees.

To find the total distance from his starting point, we need to add these two vectors.  

**The resultant vector is the sum of the two vectors, and we can find its magnitude using the Pythagorean theorem.**

* **Magnitude of the resultant vector:** √(90² + 144²) = √(8100 + 20736) = √28836 = 169.9 miles.

**Therefore, Elvis is approximately 169.9 miles from his house.** 



**Final answer: 169.9**

"The boat's value depreciates in a linear fashion, with each year's depreciation being 30% of the previous year's value.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"The bag contains 232 candies, with 54 red candies.  To determine the number of pink candies, we need to consider the distribution of the other colors.  

* Orange candies: Twice the number of red candies is 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
* Yellow candies: Half the number of red candies is 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  

Therefore, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = **43**.

"Helen's trip to Germany involved a 3-night stay at a hotel and 7 bus rides.  The cost of a single night at the hotel was $80.  Each bus trip cost 10% of the cost of a single night at the hotel.  

To calculate the total cost of the bus trips, we can use the following formula:

* Cost of one bus trip = 0.10 * $80 = $8

The total cost of the bus trips is then:

* Total cost of bus trips = $8 * 7 = $56

The total cost of the hotel is:

* Total cost of hotel = $80 * 3 = $240

Therefore, the total cost of Helen's trip is:

* Total cost = $240 + $56 = $296

"The average of Mia and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

2x + 16 = 96

2x = 80

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To determine the number of chickens, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20**  (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
