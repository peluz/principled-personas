"Let's break down the problem using a systematic approach:

* **Seattle's sheep:** We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
* **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times the sheep of Seattle, meaning it has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice the sheep of Charleston, so it has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* **Total sheep:**  To find the total number of sheep across all three cities, we add the sheep from each: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

"The download can be broken down into two distinct phases:

1. **Initial Download:** Carla downloads 80 GB of the 200 GB file, taking 40 minutes.
2. **Restart and Re-download:**  A system update requires a restart, halting the download.  The remaining 120 GB needs to be downloaded.

To calculate the total time, we need to consider the time spent on each phase.

* **Phase 1:** 40 minutes
* **Phase 2:** 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

**Total download time:** 40 minutes + 60 minutes = **100 minutes**

"Let's analyze the problem using a combination of distance, speed, and time.

* **Initial Trip:** John travels 180 miles at a speed of 60 mph for 3 hours.
* **Traffic:** He encounters 2 hours of standstill traffic, which means his speed is 0 mph.
* **Final Trip:** He then drives for 4 hours at 80 mph.

To find the distance from home, we need to consider the total distance traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled during the initial trip.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled during the traffic.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 0 mph x 2 hours = 0 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled during the final trip.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles

**Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled.**

* Total distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 320 miles = 500 miles

**Therefore, John is 500 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours.**


**Answer:** 500 miles

"Eliza's earnings for this week can be determined by calculating her regular pay and overtime pay separately, then adding them together. 

* **Regular Pay:**  Her regular hourly rate is $10, and she works 40 hours, so her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.
* **Overtime Pay:**  She works 5 additional hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay is 5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60.
* **Total Earnings:**  Her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460.

"To determine the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money, we need to find the time it takes for his annual profit to exceed his annual expenses.  

Let's represent the number of years as 'x'.  

The annual profit can be represented as: 
* Profit = (Price per lemon * Number of lemons) - (Cost of watering and feeding)

We know:
* Price per lemon = $1.50
* Number of lemons = 7
* Cost of watering and feeding = $3.00

Therefore, the profit equation becomes:
* Profit = (1.50 * 7) - 3.00 = 10.50 - 3.00 = 7.50

We want to find the value of 'x' when the profit is greater than the expenses.  

The equation for the profit is:
* Profit = 7.50

We can solve for 'x' by setting the profit equal to the expenses and solving for 'x'.

* 7.50 = 3.00
* 7.50 / 3.00 = x
* x = 2.5

Therefore, it will take Carlos **2.5 years** to start earning money. 


**Final answer: 2.5**

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

* **Green House:**  x/3 
* **Red House:** x/3 + 2
* **Orange House:** (x/3 + 5/3) / 2

We know she has 5 remaining.  This means:

x/3 + (x/3 + 2) + (x/3 + 5/3) / 2 = 5

Simplifying the equation:

x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x/3 + 5/3) / 2 = 5

Combining like terms:

x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x/6 + 5/6) = 5

Solving for x:

(2x/3) + 2 + (x/6 + 5/6) = 5

Combining like terms:

(4x/6) + (2 + 5/6) = 5

Simplifying:

(4x/6) + (17/6) = 5

Multiplying both sides by 6:

4x + 17 = 30

Subtracting 17 from both sides:

4x = 13

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 3.25

Therefore, Melanie started with 3.25 vacuum cleaners.

"Let Darrell's current age be represented by the variable 'd' and Allen's current age be represented by the variable 'a'.  We are given that the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be expressed as:

d/a = 7/11

We also know that their total age is 162.  This can be expressed as:

d + a = 162

To solve for the ages, we can use a system of equations:

1.  d/a = 7/11
2.  d + a = 162

We can solve for 'd' in the first equation:

d = (7/11) * a

Now, substitute this value of 'd' into the second equation:

((7/11) * a) + a = 162

Simplify and solve for 'a':

(18/11) * a = 162
a = 162 * (11/18)
a = 99

Therefore, Allen's current age is 99.  To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10:

99 + 10 = 109

**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is given as 110.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since the number of silver coins is represented by 'x', we can find the number of gold coins by substituting the value of 'x' back into the expression 'x + 30':

Gold coins = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins. 


"
"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of jewels Raymond has.
* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has x/2 + 5 jewels.
* Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning Siobhan has (x/2 + 5) - 2 jewels.

We know Raymond has 40 jewels, so x = 40.

Now we can substitute this value into the equation for Aaron's jewels:

Aaron has (40/2 + 5) - 2 = 20 + 5 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Finally, Siobhan has (40/2 + 5) - 2 = 20 + 5 - 2 = 23 jewels.

**Answer:** Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'r' represent Dana's running speed in miles per hour.
* Let 'w' represent Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.

We know the following:

*  r = 4w  (Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed)
*  w = 3 miles/hour (Dana's skipping speed)

We are given that Dana spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.  

*  Time spent running: 2 hours
*  Time spent walking: 4 hours

We can now set up an equation to find the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking

Let's calculate the distance traveled in each mode of transportation:

* Distance running = r * time running = 4w * 2 = 8w
* Distance walking = w * time walking = 3 * 4 = 12

Now, we can substitute the value of 'w' and calculate the total distance:

Total distance = 8w + 12w = 20w

We know that w = 3 miles/hour, so:

Total distance = 20 * 3 = 60 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 60 miles in six hours. 


**Answer:** 60 miles

"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon, we need to consider the dragon's reach and the javelin's increased range when the gemstone is held.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.  Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet with the gemstone, and this distance is increased by 3 times the original range when the gemstone is held.

Therefore, the javelin can be thrown 400 feet + (3 * 400 feet) = 1600 feet.

To find the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon, we need to find the distance from the dragon that allows the javelin to reach the dragon. 

The answer is 1600 feet.

"To determine the maximum grams of chips you can consume while adhering to your daily calorie target, we need to consider the calorie content per serving and the total calories you have remaining. 

The bag of chips provides 250 calories per serving.  You have 200 calories remaining from your daily target of 2000 calories.

To calculate the maximum grams of chips you can consume, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories from the chips:** 
   * 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

2. **Calculate the remaining calories:**
   * 2000 calories (target) - 1800 calories (consumed) = 200 calories

3. **Determine the maximum grams of chips:**
   * 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

4. **Convert servings to grams:**
   * 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams


Therefore, you can consume **200 grams** of chips.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'b' represent the cost of one blue tie.
* Let 'r' represent the cost of one red tie.

We know:

*  r = 1.5b (Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties)
*  b + 2r = 200 (Total cost of blue ties is $200)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* b + 2(1.5b) = 200
* b + 3b = 200
* 4b = 200
* b = 50 (The cost of one blue tie is $50)

Now, we can find the cost of one red tie:

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of relative speed.  

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's. This means Gerald's time is the base, and Lee's time is 2 seconds greater. 
* **The Impact of the Diet:**  Gerald's diet has improved his speed by 10%. This is a percentage increase, which we can represent as a decimal. 10% is equal to 0.10.
* **Setting up the Equation:**  We can express Gerald's new time as a function of his original time. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'.  His new time, after the diet, is represented by 'x + 0.1x'.  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.

* **Solving for Gerald's New Time:**  We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Lee's time and Gerald's time:
   x + 2 = 38

* **Solving for x:**  We can solve for 'x' by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
   x = 36

* **Calculating Gerald's New Time:**  Now that we know Gerald's original time, we can calculate his new time after the diet:
   x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. 

* We know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo.  This translates to the following equation: 
   * Brittany's photos = 50 * x

* We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. This translates to the following equation:
   * Jamal's photos = 1800

* We can now set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of ducks and the number of photographs:
   * 50 * x = 1800

* To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:
   * x = 1800 / 50
   * x = 36

**Therefore, there are 36 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.**

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let:

*  *w* represent the cost of a watermelon
*  *p* represent the cost of a pepper
*  *o* represent the cost of an orange

We are given the following information:

*  *w = 3p* 
*  *o = w - 5*

We are also given the following quantities:

*  *4w* watermelons
*  *20p* peppers
*  *10o* oranges

The total cost is the sum of the cost of each item:

*  Total cost = 4w + 20p + 10o

Substituting the given equations for *w* and *o* into the total cost equation:

*  Total cost = 4(3p) + 20p + 10(w - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

*  Total cost = 12p + 20p + 10w - 50
*  Total cost = 32p + 10w - 50

We know that *p = $15*, so we can substitute this into the equation:

*  Total cost = 32(15) + 10w - 50
*  Total cost = 480 + 10w - 50
*  Total cost = 430 + 10w

We also know that *w = 3p*, so we can substitute this into the equation:

*  Total cost = 430 + 10(3 * 15)
*  Total cost = 430 + 450
*  Total cost = 880


Therefore, the total cost of the items is **$880**.

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let's represent the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees with the variables q, b, and w, respectively. 

We know the following:

* **q:** The number of queens.
* **b:** The number of baby bees.
* **w:** The number of worker bees.

We are given the following relationships:

* **w = 2b:** The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees.
* **b = 2q:** The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.

We can use these relationships to express the total number of bees in terms of the number of queens.

**Total Bees = q + b + w**

Substituting the given relationships:

**700 = q + 2q + 2(2q)**

Simplifying the equation:

**700 = q + 2q + 4q**
**700 = 7q**
**q = 100**

Now, we can find the number of worker bees using the relationship w = 2b:

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations:

* Let 'x' represent Sally Four's age.
* Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, we know that x = 8.
* Granny Red's age is twice Sally Four's age, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
* Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the four birds:

Total age = x + x + 16 + 19 = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is **51 years**.

"To determine the total time required for Billy to prepare all the potatoes, we need to consider the time spent on peeling and cutting. 

* **Peeling:**  Billy takes 1.5 minutes per potato, and he has 60 potatoes, so the total peeling time is 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.
* **Cutting:**  Each potato takes 5 seconds to cut, and he has 60 potatoes, so the total cutting time is 60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds.

To find the total time, we need to convert the peeling time from minutes to seconds: 90 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5400 seconds.

Finally, we add the time for peeling and cutting: 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy **5700 seconds** to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
* The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.  
* They sell each glass for $0.50, and they make 20 glasses per gallon.
* Their profit is $25.

We can set up the following equations:

* **Equation 1:** Total cost = (Cost per gallon * Number of gallons)
* **Equation 2:** Total revenue = (Price per glass * Number of glasses)
* **Equation 3:** Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

**Solving for the number of gallons:**

* We know the profit is $25, and the price per glass is $0.50, and they make 20 glasses per gallon.  
* We can use Equation 2 to find the total revenue: $0.50 * 20 * x = 10x
* We can use Equation 3 to find the total cost: $25 = 10x - (3x + 2x)
* Simplifying Equation 3: $25 = 10x - 5x
* Solving for x: $25 = 5x
* Therefore, x = 5 gallons.

**Calculating the cost of lemons:**

* The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
* The total cost of lemons is $3 * 5 = $15.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'B' represent the number of crabs Bo has.
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has B - 4 crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has B - 4 + 10 = B + 6 crabs.

Now, we know that the total number of crabs is the sum of the crabs each person has:

Total crabs = B + (B - 4) + (B + 6)

Simplifying the equation:

Total crabs = 3B + 2

We are given that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.  Substituting this into the equation:

Total crabs = 3(40) + 2 = 120 + 2 = 122

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"To determine the number of red roses required, we can use the following algebraic representation:

Let 'x' represent the number of white carnations.  

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can express the number of red roses as 4x.

We also know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. This translates to:

* 200 = 5x

Solving for x, we get:

* x = 200 / 5 = 40

Now, we can find the number of red roses:

* Red roses = 4 * x = 4 * 40 = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver **160** red roses by 5 pm.

*  M - 2 = (J/2) + 5 (Mark's age two years ago)
*  M = 22 (Mark's current age)

Now, we can substitute the value of J into the second equation:

* M - 2 = (30/2) + 5
* M - 2 = 15 + 5
* M - 2 = 20
* M = 22

Finally, we can find Jean's age:

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is the sum of the times of each runner: 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds.

The faster team's time is the product of the time per runner multiplied by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic variables:

* Let Adrian's current age be represented by 'a'
* Let Harriet's current age be represented by 'h'
* Let Zack's current age be represented by 'z'

We are given the following information:

*  a = 3h  (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age)
*  h = z/2  (Harriet's age is half of Zack's age)

We are asked to find the average age of the three in three years.  This means we need to calculate the average of (a + h + z) + 3.

To find the average, we can substitute the values of 'a', 'h', and 'z' from the given equations:

(3h + h + z) + 3 = (3 * (z/2) + z/2 + z) + 3

Simplifying the expression:

(3z/2 + z/2 + z) + 3 = (5z/2) + 3

Now, we need to find the value of 'z'.  We can use the fact that 'h = z/2' to substitute 'z' in the expression:

(5 * (z/2) / 2) + 3 = (5z/4) + 3

To find the average age in three years, we need to substitute the value of 'z' in the expression:

(5z/4) + 3

We can't calculate the exact value of 'z' without knowing the value of 'z' itself. 

**Therefore, we cannot determine the exact average age of the three in three years without knowing Zack's current age.**

"The watermelon farm initially had 120 watermelons.  After the first harvest, 30% of the watermelons were ready, representing 36 watermelons.  

The remaining watermelons were 84.  After the second harvest, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, which is 63.  

To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we can subtract the number of watermelons harvested from the initial number of watermelons: 120 - 63 = 57. 

Therefore, 57 watermelons were not ready for harvest after the second visit.

* Let Jessa's age be represented by 'j'
* Joan's age is represented by 'j + 5'
* Mary's age is represented by 'j + 5 + 2'

We know that j = 20, so:

* Joan's age is j + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
* Mary's age is j + 5 + 2 = 20 + 5 + 2 = 27

Finally, the sum of their ages is 20 + 25 + 27 = 72.

"The problem can be solved using a straightforward application of the principles of set theory and proportion. 

* **Step 1:**  We begin with the initial number of students, 1000.
* **Step 2:**  30% of the students exit through exit A, representing 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.
* **Step 3:**  The remaining students, 1000 - 300 = 700, are then considered.
* **Step 4:**  3/5 of the remaining students exit through exit B, which is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.
* **Step 5:**  The final step involves calculating the number of students who exit through exit C. This is achieved by subtracting the number of students who exited through A and B from the total number of students: 700 - 420 = 280 students.


Therefore, **280** students exited through exit C.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'R' represent the number of candies Robert has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of candies John has.
* We know that J = 2R (John has twice as many candies as Robert).
* We also know that J = 54 (John has 54 candies).

Substituting the value of J in the first equation: 54 = 2R

Solving for R: R = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, we can find the number of candies James has: J = 2R, so J = 2 * 27 = 54.

Finally, the difference between John's and James's candies is 54 - 33 = 21.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial fries:** Griffin starts with 24 french fries.
* **Kyle's contribution:** Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
* **Billy's contribution:** Billy takes twice the number Kyle took, so he takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
* **Colby's contribution:** Colby takes 3 fewer fries than Kyle, meaning he takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
* **Final count:** Griffin ends up with 19 - 2 = 17 fries.
* **Ginger's contribution:**  To reach the final count of 27, Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 17 = 10 fries.


**Answer:** Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 's' represent the number of snails in the first aquarium.
*  Let 'f' represent the number of fish in the first aquarium.

We are given the following information:

*  s = 4 
*  f = 14
*  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish: s - f = 2 * f

We can now substitute the given values into the equation:

*  4 - 14 = 2 * 14

Simplifying the equation:

*  -10 = 28

This equation is not true.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

* Let 'b' represent the number of bananas Jamal has.

We are given the following information:

* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:  a = b + 8
* Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: b = a + 4

We are also given that Andrea has 52 apples.  Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

* a = b + 8
* 52 = (b + 8) + 4

Simplifying the equation:

* 52 = b + 12
* b = 40

Now, we can substitute the value of 'b' back into the first equation to find the number of apples Jamal has:

* a = 40 + 8
* a = 48

Finally, we can find the total number of fruits:

* Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
* Total fruits = 52 + 48 + 40 = 140

Therefore, there are **140** fruits.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations:

* Let 'x' represent the number of stitches in each sleeve.

We know the following:

* The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches:  This is represented as 900 = x + x + ... (where 'x' is the number of stitches in each sleeve)
* The collar takes 90 stitches: This is represented as 90 = 0.1 * 900
* The rosette takes 180 stitches: This is represented as 180 = 2 * 90

"The problem can be solved using the concept of proportionality.  Since the cars are traveling at different speeds, the ratio of their speeds is directly proportional to the ratio of the time taken to cover the same distance. 

Let:

*  *x* be the time taken by the car in the slow lane.
*  *y* be the distance traveled by the car in the slow lane.

We know that:

*  *y* = *v* * *t*  where *v* is the speed of the car in the slow lane and *t* is the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

We also know that:

*  *y* = 30 * *x* 

Substituting the value of *y* in the first equation, we get:

*  30 * *x* = *v* * *t*

Since the distance traveled by the car in the fast lane is 480 miles, we can use the formula:

*  *d* = *v* * *t* 

Substituting the value of *v* and *d*, we get:

*  480 = 60 * *t*

Solving for *t*, we get:

*  *t* = 480 / 60 = 8 hours

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance is **8 hours**.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent Noah's current age.
* Cera's current age is 46.

We know that six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so:
* Noah's age six years ago: x - 6
* Cera's age six years ago: 46 - 6 = 40

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago. This translates to:
* Population of Chile six years ago: 3000 * (x - 6)

We can now set up an equation to represent the population of Chile six years ago:
* 3000 * (x - 6) = 60,000

To find the current population of Chile, we need to solve for the value of 'x'. 

Let's solve the equation:

"The problem presents a scenario involving a combination of cooling and dilution effects on a coffee solution.  

Let's break down the process:

* **Cooling:** The ice cubes cool the coffee by 65 degrees Celsius.
* **Weakening:** Each ice cube reduces the coffee's strength by 12 milliliters.
* **Cream Addition:** The cream is added, increasing the total volume of the solution.

To determine the final weakening, we need to consider the cumulative effect of both the cooling and the cream addition.

**Key Concept:**  The weakening effect of the ice cubes is directly proportional to the temperature change.  The weakening effect of the cream is additive.

**Calculation:**

1. **Cooling Effect:** The cooling effect of 65 degrees Celsius is directly proportional to the weakening effect of the ice cubes.  
2. **Weakening from Cooling:** The total weakening due to the cooling effect is 65 degrees Celsius * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters.
3. **Cream Addition:** The cream is added, increasing the total volume of the solution. 

**Final Answer:** The final weakening of the coffee is 780 milliliters + 15 milliliters = **795 milliliters**.

"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we need to understand the charging rate. The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.  

We are given that the phone is currently at 60% charge.  To reach 100% charge, the phone needs to gain an additional 40% of charge. 

Let's calculate the time required to achieve this:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total charge gain:** The phone needs to gain 40% of charge, which is 0.40.
* **Step 2: Determine the time required for the charge gain:**  The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes.  To find the time for 40%, we can use the following equation:

"To determine the net income difference between the two jobs, we need to consider both the gross pay and the tax implications for each.

**Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Tax:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

"The problem presents a classic system of equations to solve for the number of chickens and cows on the farm.  

Let's represent the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'.  We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
* **Equation 2:** c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

To solve for the unknowns, we can use substitution.  From Equation 2, we can express 'c' in terms of 'w': c = 2w.  

Substituting this into Equation 1: 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms: 3w = 60

Solving for 'w': w = 60 / 3 = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find 'c': c = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, to determine the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs per animal:

* Chickens have 2 legs each.

"Karan's monthly payment is calculated as follows:

* **Total Interest:** The annual interest rate of 10% translates to a monthly interest rate of 10/12 = 0.8333%.
* **Monthly Payment:**  To find the monthly payment, we need to consider the principal amount and the monthly interest rate.  The formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan is:

   **M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]**

   Where:
   * M = Monthly payment
   * P = Principal amount ($3650)
   * i = Monthly interest rate (0.008333)
   * n = Number of months (5)

* **Calculation:** Plugging in the values:

   M = 3650 * [ 0.008333 (1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 – 1]

   M ≈ $3680.42

**Therefore, Karan needs to pay approximately $3680.42 per month.**

"Mel's energy consumption can be analyzed by considering the power consumption and the time of use.  

First, we need to determine the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh).  

* Power (in watts) is the rate of energy consumption, and it is related to energy (in watt-hours) by the following equation: 
   * Energy (watt-hours) = Power (watts) * Time (hours)

*  Mel's AC uses 900 watts and operates for 8 hours daily, resulting in:
   * Energy (watt-hours) = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours

*  If Mel reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, his daily energy consumption becomes:
   * Energy (watt-hours) = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours

*  The energy saved daily is:
   * Energy saved = 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours

*  To express this in kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000:
   * Energy saved in kWh = 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

*  Over 30 days, the total energy saved is:

"The problem presents a system of two linear equations representing the relationship between the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd.  

Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** c + d = 180 (The total number of heads in the herd)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps in the herd)

To solve for the number of dromedaries, we can utilize a method called substitution.  

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
2(180 - d) + d = 304

* 0.40x + 0.75c = 5.00
* 0.75c = 5.00 - 0.40x
* c = (5.00 - 0.40x) / 0.75

We can substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 3 to solve for 'x'.

* 0.01(5.00) = 0.05
* 0.05 = 0.05

This equation tells us that George has 0.05 of his money left.

We can now solve for 'x' in Equation 1:

* 0.40x + 0.75c = 5.00
* 0.40x + 0.75 * ((5.00 - 0.40x) / 0.75) = 5.00
* 0.40x + (5.00 - 0.40x) = 5.00
* 0.40x + 5.00 - 0.40x = 5.00
* 5.00 = 5.00

This equation tells us that George has 5.00 dollars left.

"The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding twice the length and twice the width.  We are given the area of the room, which is 360 square feet.  We can use this information to find the width.  

* Area = length * width
* 360 = 9 * width
* width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet

Now, we can calculate the perimeter:

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is **98 feet**.

"The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees in 3 hours of oven operation.  The temperature is then reduced by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.  

To find the final temperature, we need to consider the oven's heating effect and the cooling effect of the window. 

* **Oven Heating:** The oven operates for 3 hours, which is equal to 180 minutes.  The temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, so the total increase is 180 minutes * 5 degrees/hour = 900 degrees.
* **Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is equal to 30/10 = 3 degrees per 10 minutes.  The total cooling effect is 3 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = 9 degrees.

The final temperature is calculated as follows:

* **Initial Temperature:** 40 degrees
* **Oven Heating:** 900 degrees
* **Cooling:** -9 degrees
* **Final Temperature:** 40 + 900 - 9 = 931 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the regular price of popcorn.  We can represent the given information as follows:

*  The cost of the super ticket and popcorn/soda combo is $21.
*  The cost of the regular ticket and popcorn/soda combo is $19.

We can express this mathematically as:

*  20 + 1 = 21  (super ticket cost + $1 for combo)
*  12 + x + 3 = 19 (regular ticket cost + x for popcorn + $3 for soda)

Solving for x, we get:

*  21 = 20 + 1
*  12 + x + 3 = 19

Simplifying the equations:

*  1 = 1
*  x + 15 = 19

Solving for x:

*  x = 19 - 15
*  x = 4

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is **$4**.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic variables:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the computer.
* The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so it cost 'x - $400'.
* The total cost of the computer, printer, and monitors is $2400.  This can be expressed as an equation: x + (x - $400) + 2y = $2400

We know the computer cost $1100, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1100 + (1100 - $400) + 2y = $2400

Simplifying the equation: 
* 1100 + 700 + 2y = $2400
* 1800 + 2y = $2400

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial shares:** Each boy starts with $6.
* **Eldest's additions:** The eldest boy adds $5 and then another $10, totaling $11 + $10 = $21.
* **Spending:** The eldest boy spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.
* **Tripling the remaining amount:** The eldest boy triples his remaining amount, which is $13, resulting in $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

"Elvis's goal is to save $1125 in a month.  To achieve this, he's aiming to increase his daily savings in the second half of the month compared to the first half.  Let's break down the problem:

* **First Half Savings:**  We need to determine the daily savings for the first half of the month.  
* **Second Half Savings:**  He wants to save twice the amount in the second half, so we need to calculate the daily savings for the second half.

**Let's use the following variables:**

*  *x* = daily savings in the first half of the month
*  *y* = daily savings in the second half of the month

**Setting up the Equations:**

*  We know that the total savings for the month is $1125.  
*  The first half savings is *x* days * (number of days in the first half)
*  The second half savings is *y* days * (number of days in the second half)

**Solving for the Variables:**

*  We can express the total savings as:  *x* * (number of days in the first half) + *y* * (number of days in the second half) = $1125

**Finding the Daily Savings in the Second Half:**

*  We know that the second half savings is twice the first half savings.  
*  Therefore, *y* = 2 * *x*

**Solving for *x*:**

*  We can substitute the value of *y* into the total savings equation: *x* * (number of days in the first half) + 2 * *x* * (number of days in the second half) = $1125

**Final Calculation:**

*  We need to know the number of days in the first and second half of the month to solve for *x* and *y*.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic representation.  

We are given that Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's set, which has 80 toys.  This means the desired size of Jonathan's set is 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

To achieve this, Jonathan needs to have 2 more toys than he currently has.  Let 'x' represent the number of toys Jonathan currently possesses.  We can set up the following equation:

x + 2 = 400 - 2

Solving for x, we get:

x = 400 - 2 - 2
x = 396

Therefore, Jonathan currently has **396** toys.

"Antonella's commission earnings can be calculated by breaking down the sales into two parts:

* **Tier 1:**  For goods valued up to $1000, the commission rate is 30%.  Therefore, the commission on this portion is calculated as: $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

* **Tier 2:**  For sales exceeding $1000, the commission rate is 10% on the amount above $1000.  The amount exceeding $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.  The commission on this amount is calculated as: $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

The total commission earned is the sum of the commissions from both tiers: $300 + $150 = $450.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'A' represent Anna's goals.
* Let 'M' represent Mark's goals.
* Let 'R' represent Richie's goals.

We know the following:

* R = M + 20 
* R = A + 45

We also know R = 80.  Substituting the first equation into the second equation:

80 = M + 20 + 45

Simplifying the equation:

80 = M + 65

Solving for M:

M = 80 - 65
M = 15

Now we can find A:

A = R - 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Finally, we can find the total goals:

Total Goals = A + M + R
Total Goals = 35 + 15 + 80
Total Goals = 140

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the total sales from red hats in the first month.
* Since green hat sales were half of red hat sales, green hat sales are represented by 'x/2'.
* The total sales in the first month is the sum of red hat sales and green hat sales: x + (x/2) = $600.
* In the second month, sales are 3/4 of the first month's sales: (3/4) * $600 = $450.
*  We can express the total sales in the second month as: (3/4) * (x + (x/2)) = $450.

Now, let's solve for 'x' in the first month's sales equation:

* x + (x/2) = $600
* (3x/2) = $600
* 3x = $1200
* x = $400

Now, we can find the total sales in the second month:

* (3/4) * (x + (x/2)) = $450
* (3/4) * ($400 + $200) = $450
* (3/4) * $600 = $450
* $450 = $450

Therefore, the total sales in two months is $600 + $450 = $1050.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the cooking time for rice.
* Pork takes 20 minutes longer than rice, so it takes 'x + 20' minutes.
* Beans take half the combined time of rice and pork, meaning they take (x + (x + 20))/2 = (2x + 20)/2 = x + 10 minutes.

Now, the total cooking time is the sum of the individual times: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 30.

Simplifying the equation: 3x + 30 = 30

Solving for x: 3x = 0
Therefore, x = 0 minutes.

This result is not possible as cooking time cannot be zero.

"The problem presents a classic ratio-based scenario.  We can express the relationship between the cat's and dog's eating rates as a ratio:

* Cat's rate: 9 sausages / 30 minutes
* Dog's rate:  x sausages / y minutes

Since the dog's rate is 2/3 the cat's rate, we can set up the following proportion:

(x sausages / y minutes) = (9 sausages / 30 minutes) * (2/3)

Simplifying the equation:

(x / y) = (2/3) * (9/30)

(x / y) = 1/5

To find the average time, we need to find the average of the individual times.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of proportions.  

* **Understanding the Relationship:** We know that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls. This means the ratio of Pomeranians to girls is 1:3.
* **Finding the Total:**  Since we know there are 6 girls, and this represents one-third of the Pomeranians, we can find the total number of Pomeranians by setting up a proportion: 
   *  6 girls / 1/3 Pomeranians = x Pomeranians / 1
* **Solving for x:**  Cross-multiplying, we get: 6 * 3 = 1 * x
* **Calculating:** This simplifies to 18 = x.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
* The second house needs half the amount of the first, so it needs x/2 cases.
* The third house needs double the amount of the first, so it needs 2x cases.

The total number of cases needed is the sum of the cases for all three houses: x + (x/2) + 2x = 250

Combining like terms: (5/2)x + 2x = 250

Simplifying: (9/2)x = 250

Solving for x: x = 250 * (2/9) = 55.56 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we need to round this value to the nearest whole number. 

The third house needs approximately 56 cases of shingles.

"Milly's return will result in a net loss of $21.00.  

Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

* **Shipping Cost:** The shipping company charges a fixed fee of $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The total shipping cost is calculated as follows: 
    * Weight: 4 pounds
    * Cost per pound: $0.35
    * Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
    * Distance: 20 miles
    * Cost per mile: $0.08
    * Total mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
    * Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

* **Refund:** Amazon will refund 75% of the book's original price, which is $32.00.
    * Refund amount: $32.00 * 0.75 = $24.00

* **Loss:**  The final cost Milly will incur is the total cost of the return minus the refund.
    * Total cost: $3.00
    * Refund amount: $24.00
    * Loss: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00

"Boris's production pattern is a simple arithmetic sequence.  We can break it down:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

To find the production for week 4, we need to consider the total production for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

The total production for the month is 50,000 bars.  

To find the production for week 4, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"The cost of the installation can be calculated by considering the base price and the additional charges for each item. 

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so the cost for the mirrors is 6 * $15.00 = $90.00.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so the cost for the chandeliers is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so the cost for the pictures is 20 * $15.00 = $300.00.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the installation is **$529.00**.

"To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  We know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. Therefore, Saskay's lifting capacity is 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.  Thus, Kagiyami's lifting capacity is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  Therefore, Naruto's lifting capacity is 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"
"The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the speed, time, and distance.  

Let's break it down:

* **Kangaroos and Distance:**  The total distance traveled by the kangaroos is directly proportional to the time they take.  
* **Turtles and Speed:**  The time taken by the turtles is inversely proportional to their speed.

Since the distance is constant, we can set up a proportion:

*  Time (kangaroos) / Speed (kangaroos) = Time (turtles) / Speed (turtles)

Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'k' and the speed of a turtle as 't'.  We know:

* Time (kangaroos) = 18 hours
* Speed (kangaroos) = k
* Time (turtles) = ?
* Speed (turtles) = t = k/2

Substituting these values into the proportion:

18/k = Time (turtles) / (k/2)

Solving for Time (turtles):

Time (turtles) = (18 * 2) / k = 36/k

Since the distance is constant, the time taken by the turtles is inversely proportional to their speed.  Therefore, the time taken by four turtles will be 36/k. 


**Answer:** 36/k

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of dishes Kora makes.
* Rory makes x + 20 dishes.
* Jada makes 2(x + 20) dishes.

The total number of dishes is the sum of their individual creations: x + (x + 20) + 2(x + 20) = 140

Simplifying the equation: 
x + x + 20 + 2x + 40 = 140
4x + 60 = 140

Solving for x:
4x = 80
x = 20

Now we can find the number of dishes each person makes:

* Kora: x = 20 dishes
* Rory: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 dishes
* Jada: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 80 dishes

Finally, the total number of dishes is 20 + 40 + 80 = **140 dishes**.

* Let 'J' represent the number of socks Jack has.
* Let 'D' represent the number of dishes Jack has.

We are given the following information:

* J = 2D  (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
* S = 2J (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)
* D = 60 (Jack collected 60 dishes)

Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for the number of socks:

"To determine the number of glue stick packs Mr. Jackson needs, we must consider the number of glue sticks required and the number of glue sticks per pack. 

The total number of glue sticks needed is 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Since glue sticks are sold in packs of 8, we can divide the total glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

As we can't purchase fractions of packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to purchase **7** packs.

"The plague exhibits exponential growth, meaning the number of infected individuals increases rapidly.  

To calculate the number of infected individuals after three days, we can use the following formula:

* **N(t) = N₀ * (1 + r)^t**

Where:

* N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t
* N₀ is the initial number of infected individuals (10)
* r is the growth rate (6, as each infected person infects 6 others)
* t is the time elapsed (3 days)

Plugging in the values:

* N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
* N(3) = 10 * (7)^3
* N(3) = 10 * 343
* N(3) = 3430

* **Small masks:**  The ratio of material used per small mask is 2 yards.
* **Large masks:** The ratio of material used per large mask is 2.25 yards.

To find the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

(Small mask material) / (Small mask quantity) = (Large mask material) / (Large mask quantity)

Let's denote the total material needed for the small masks as 'x' and the total material needed for the large masks as 'y'.  We can then set up the following proportion:

"To determine Azibo's score, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information.  Let's represent the scores as follows:

*  Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
*  Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
*  Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

From the first two equations, we can express B in terms of A and D:

* B = A + 20
* B = D + 10

Therefore, we can substitute the value of B from the first equation into the third equation:

* A + D + (A + 20) = 45

Simplifying the equation:

* 2A + D + 20 = 45
* 2A + D = 25

We can now solve for D in terms of A:

* D = 25 - 2A

We can substitute this value of D back into the equation B = D + 10:

* B = (25 - 2A) + 10
* B = 35 - 2A

Now, we can substitute the value of B back into the equation B = A + 20:

* A + 20 = 35 - 2A
* 3A = 15
* A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"The problem states that the island had four times as many holes as at the end of the first day.  This means the number of holes on the fourth day is directly proportional to the number of holes dug on the first day. 

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can use the following equation:

* **Holes on the fourth day = (Number of holes on the first day) * 4**

We know the number of holes dug on the first day is 10.  Therefore:

* **Holes on the fourth day = 10 * 4 = 40**

The question asks for the number of holes dug on the fourth day **before** finding the treasure.  This means we need to subtract the number of holes filled in from the total number of holes dug on the fourth day.

* **Holes dug before finding the treasure = 40 - 2 = 38**

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get. 
* The remaining person gets x + 15 chips.

We know that the total number of chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

* x + x + (x + 15) = 265

Simplifying the equation:

* 3x + 15 = 265

Subtracting 15 from both sides:

* 3x = 250

Dividing both sides by 3:

* x = 83.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's consider the problem in terms of the number of people. 

* The problem states that two people get an equal amount of chips, and the remaining person gets 15 more than the others.  This implies that the number of people is 3. 

* We can now use the information given to find the total number of chips. 

Let's use the information given to find the total number of chips. 

* Amora and Lainey get 70 chips each, so they get a total of 70 + 70 = 140 chips.
* The remaining person gets 15 more chips than the others, so they get 140 + 15 = 155 chips.

"Let's analyze the given information to determine Stan's Pokemon catch.

We are given that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can express this as a system of equations:

*  A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

To solve for Stan's catch (S), we can utilize the first two equations to express A and S in terms of W.

*  From the first equation, A = S + 5
*  From the second equation, S = 4W - 13

Substituting these into the third equation:

(S + 5) + (4W - 13) + W = 339

Simplifying the equation:

S + 5 + 4W - 13 + W = 339
S + 5W - 8 = 339

Now, we can solve for S in terms of W:

S = 339 + 8 - 5W
S = 347 - 5W

We know that Adelwolfe caught W Pokemon.  To find Stan's catch, we need to find the value of W.  We can substitute the value of W into the equation for S:

S = 347 - 5W

We can now substitute the value of W into the equation for S:

S = 347 - 5(41)
S = 347 - 205
S = 142

Therefore, Stan caught 142 Pokemon. 


**Answer:** Stan has caught 142 Pokemon.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Richard has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
* We know that the total number of cherries is 60: R + J + 30 = 60

* We also know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard: R = J + 10

Now we can substitute the value of R from the second equation into the first equation:

(J + 10) + J + 30 = 60

Combining like terms: 2J + 40 = 60

Subtracting 40 from both sides: 2J = 20

Dividing both sides by 2: J = 10

Now we can find the number of cherries Robert has:

R = J + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20

Finally, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

Robert has 20 - 10 = 10 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Emil's current age be represented by 'e'
* Let his father's current age be represented by 'f'
* Let his brother's current age be represented by 'b'

We know the following:

*  e = 19 (Emil's current age)
*  f = 2 * e (Emil's father will be twice Emil's age when he turns 24)
*  b = e / 2 (Emil's brother will be half Emil's age when he turns 24)

We can use these equations to find the ages of Emil's father and brother.

*  f = 2 * 19 = 38 (Emil's father's age)
*  b = 19 / 2 = 9.5 (Emil's brother's age)

A steel pickaxe provides an additional 50% increase over the iron pickaxe, so the steel pickaxe yields 12 * 1.5 = 18 pounds per day.

To determine the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we first need to calculate the daily output of the group.  The total daily output is 18 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds.

Finally, we need to calculate the total ore mined over 30 days.  The total ore mined is 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds.

"Marcus's homework situation presents a classic example of conditional probability.  We can break down the problem into mutually exclusive events:

* **Event A:** Marcus has a substitute teacher.
* **Event B:** Marcus receives an extension.

We are interested in the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, which is the probability of either event A or B occurring.

* **P(A) = 0.5** (50% chance of a substitute teacher)
* **P(B) = 0.4** (40% chance of an extension)

We can use the following formula to calculate the probability of both events occurring:

**P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)**

Where P(B|A) is the probability of an extension given that a substitute teacher is present.

* **P(B|A) = 0.4** (given in the problem)

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the present value of his future earnings. 

Here's how we can approach this:

* **Present Value of Future Earnings:**  The present value of the $300,000 in future earnings is the amount of money Jim would need to invest today to achieve that future income stream. This is calculated using the concept of the time value of money, which considers the impact of compounding interest. 
* **Present Value of Lost Income:**  The present value of the $100,000 lost income is the amount of money Jim would need to invest today to achieve that future income stream. This is calculated using the same concept of the time value of money.

**Calculating the Time:**

To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to find the present value of his future earnings and compare it to the present value of his lost income. 

**Note:**  The time it takes to recoup the loan payments and lost income will depend on the interest rate on the loans.

"The car's price follows an exponential decay model.  We can represent this with the formula:

P(t) = P₀ * (1 - r)^t

Where:

* P(t) is the price at time t
* P₀ is the initial price ($20,000)
* r is the decay rate (21% or 0.21)
* t is the time elapsed in years

To find the price in 2010, we need to calculate the value of P(t) when t = 3 (since 2010 is 3 years after 2007).

P(3) = 20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3 
P(3) = 20000 * (0.79)^3

"The room's surface area is determined by the sum of the areas of its four walls.  

* North and South: 10 ft * 8 ft = 80 square feet
* East and West: 5 ft * 8 ft = 40 square feet

Therefore, the total area of the walls is 80 sq ft + 40 sq ft = 120 square feet.

To determine the number of gallons of paint required, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon: 120 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 6 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We are given the following information:

*  Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

Solving for 'y' in the second equation:
* 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* 2y = 44 - 2x
* y = 22 - x

Substituting the value of 'y' from the second equation into the third equation:
* 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
* 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
* 56 = 56

This equation is true for any value of 'x' and 'y'.  

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we need to find a value for 'x' that satisfies the first equation. 

Let's try a value for 'x' that makes the first equation true. 

* If x = 11, then 2(11) + (2y + 12) = 56
* 22 + 2y + 12 = 56
* 2y = 22
* y = 11

Therefore, Arnold and Madeline painted 11 eggs each. 

Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 11 + 12 = 23 eggs. 

The difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 23 - 11 = 12.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
* Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
* Let 'K' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

We are given the following information:

* J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
* C = 2K  (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
* J + C + K = 60 (Total number of seashells)

Now, we can solve for each variable:

1. **Substitute:** Since J = C + 5, we can substitute (C + 5) for J in the third equation:
   (C + 5) + C + K = 60

2. **Simplify:** Combine like terms:
   2C + K + 5 = 60

3. **Substitute:** Since C = 2K, we can substitute 2K for C in the simplified equation:
   2(2K) + K + 5 = 60

4. **Solve for K:** Simplify and solve for K:
   4K + K + 5 = 60
   5K + 5 = 60
   5K = 55
   K = 11

5. **Solve for C:** Substitute the value of K back into the equation C = 2K:
   C = 2 * 11
   C = 22

6. **Solve for J:** Substitute the values of C and K into the equation J = C + 5:
   J = 22 + 5
   J = 27

"The probability of a baby wearing a bow given they are wearing purple can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem.  

Let:

*  *A* be the event that a baby wears a bow.
*  *B* be the event that a baby wears purple.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of a baby wearing a bow given they are wearing purple.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the components:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of a baby wearing a bow given they are wearing purple. This is equal to 1/3, as 1/3 of the purple babies wear bows.
* **P(A):** The probability of a baby wearing a bow. This is 2/6, as 2 out of 6 babies wear bows.
* **P(B):** The probability of a baby wearing purple. This is 3/4, as 3 out of 4 babies wear purple.

Therefore:

P(A|B) = (1/3 * 2/6) / (3/4) 

Simplifying:

P(A|B) = (2/18) / (3/4) = 8/54 = 4/27

**Answer:** 4/27

"The problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let:

*  *y* represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  *z* represent the length of the blue rope.
*  *r* represent the length of the red rope.

We are given the following information:

1.  *r = 4z* 
2.  *z = y - 7*
3.  *y + z + r = 37*

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by 'C'.**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'W'.**

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to the equation: W = 5(C + 7)
2. **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, we can solve for our two unknowns.  

**Solving for 'C' (Colin's current age):**

* **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

* **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
   * (-2/3)C = -5
   * C = 15/2

**Therefore, Colin is currently 15/2 years old, or 7.5 years old.**

"The problem presents a classic application of volume and packing efficiency.  

First, we need to determine the volume of the jelly bean container.  The container is a rectangular prism with a base area of 36 square inches and a height of 15 inches.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the base area by the height.

* Volume = base area * height
* Volume = 36 inches * 36 inches * 15 inches
* Volume = 162 cubic inches

Next, we need to determine the volume of the jelly beans.  The packing efficiency is a crucial factor in this calculation.  The packing efficiency is the ratio of the volume of the actual jelly beans to the volume of the container.  

* Packing efficiency = 0.80

Therefore, the volume of the jelly beans is 162 cubic inches * 0.80 = 129.6 cubic inches.

Finally, we can calculate the number of jelly beans.  The number of jelly beans is the volume of the jelly beans divided by the volume per jelly bean.

* Number of jelly beans = Volume of jelly beans / Volume per jelly bean
* Number of jelly beans = 129.6 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean
* Number of jelly beans = 864 jelly beans

The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of jelly beans is 900 - 864 = 36. 



**Answer:** Tim was 36 jelly beans off.

"The problem can be solved by breaking it down into steps:

1. **Initial Passengers:** The bus starts with 20 passengers.
2. **First Stop:** 40 passengers enter, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60 passengers.
3. **Second Stop:** 3/4 of the passengers from the first stop (60/4 = 15) enter the bus, resulting in 60 + 15 = 75 passengers.
4. **Third Stop:** The bus doubles its capacity, meaning the total number of passengers increases to 75 * 2 = 150 passengers.
5. **Remaining Passengers:**  To find the number of passengers needed to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus's capacity: 200 - 150 = 50 passengers.

"The boat's value depreciates linearly, meaning each year's depreciation is a constant percentage of the previous year's value.  

* **Year 1:**  The boat depreciates 30% of its initial value, resulting in a depreciation of $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  The remaining value is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  The boat depreciates another 30% of its value from the previous year, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  The remaining value is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:**  The boat depreciates 20% of its value from the previous year, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.


Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
* Let 'y' represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.

We know the following:

*  Vanessa's distance is 4 miles, and her speed is 'x', so the time taken is 4 miles / x minutes.
* Aaron's distance is 2 miles, and his speed is 'y', so the time taken is 2 miles / y minutes.

We are given that Vanessa's time is twice as long as Aaron's time.  This translates to the following equation:

4 miles / x = 2 * (2 miles / y)

We also know that Vanessa's time is 4 minutes.  

Let's solve for 'x' and 'y'. 

*  We can simplify the equation from above to: 4 miles / x = 4 miles / y
*  We can then solve for 'y' in terms of 'x': y = 4x / 4 = x

Now, we know that Vanessa's speed is equal to Aaron's speed.  Therefore, we can substitute 'x' for 'y' in the equation:

4 miles / x = 2 * (2 miles / x)

Solving for 'x', we get:

4 miles / x = 4 miles / x

This equation is true for any value of 'x'.  

Therefore, we can conclude that Vanessa's time is 4 minutes.

*  j = 19 (John's age when James was born)
*  j1 = 2d (James's age is twice Dora's age)
*  d = 12 (Dora's current age)

We can use these equations to solve for the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

* **James's age in 3 years:** j1 + 3 = 2d + 3 = 2(12) + 3 = 24 + 3 = 27
