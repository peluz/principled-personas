"Okay, so we got a truck and a bridge.  The truck is heavy, right?  We know the truck can only hold 5000 pounds.  We need to figure out how many boxes we can put on the truck.

The truck is heavy, so we need to figure out how much the boxes weigh.  Each box is 15 pounds.  We need to see how many boxes we can put on the truck.

So, we need to divide the weight of the truck by the weight of each box.  

5000 pounds / 15 pounds/box = 333.33 boxes. 

We can't have a fraction of a box, so we need to round down.  We can put 333 boxes on the truck. 



**Answer:** 333

"Okay, so we got four schools, right?  Each school has a girls' team and a boys' team, and each team has five players.  So that's a lot of players!  And each school has a coach, too.  So, we gotta count all the players and coaches.  

* **Girls' players:** Four schools * 5 players/school = 20 girls
* **Boys' players:** Four schools * 5 players/school = 20 boys
* **Coaches:** Four schools * 1 coach/school = 4 coaches
* **Total people:** 20 girls + 20 boys + 4 coaches = 44 people 

So, there are 44 people. 



**Final answer: 44**

"Okay, so we got diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.  The diamonds are 175.  Rubies are less than diamonds, so we take 175 and take 35 away.  That's 140 rubies.  Then we got 2 times the number of emeralds as rubies, so we multiply 140 by 2, which is 280 emeralds.  So, we add all the gems together: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems. 

**Answer:** 595 
"
"Okay, so we know there are twice as many boys as girls.  So, we got 60 girls, and that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 boys.  Now, we know there are 180 students total.  So, we need to figure out how many teachers there are.  We know there are 5 students per teacher, so we divide the total students by the number of students per teacher.  That's 180 / 5 = 36 teachers. 

**Answer:** 36

"Okay, so she got $40 for eight weeks.  That's how much she got.  So, she had $60 before she got the money.

"Okay, so she teaches a lot of dance classes!  

* Weekdays she teaches 5 classes a day, that's 5 days a week, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 classes.
* Then on Saturday she teaches 8 classes, so that's 8 classes.
* Each class is 15 people, so she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 people.
* She charges 15 dollars a person, so she makes 33 * 15 = 495 dollars. 

So she makes 495 dollars a week. 


**Answer:** 495

"Two recipes, right?  So, the first one has twenty steps. The second one, it's double that, so it's forty steps.  That's a lot of steps!  You need to read sixty steps to make both.

"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for three dollars a piece and cheesecakes for four dollars a piece. He sells a lot of brownies, 43 of them.  And he sells 23 cheesecakes.  So, how much money does he make?  

* **Brownie money:** 43 brownies * 3 dollars/brownie = 129 dollars
* **Cheesecake money:** 23 cheesecakes * 4 dollars/cheesecake = 92 dollars
* **Total money:** 129 dollars + 92 dollars = 221 dollars 

So, Tommy makes 221 dollars.

"Okay, so Shiela got five phones, right?  That's five times one hundred fifty dollars.  That's a whole lot of phones!  And they want to pay it off in three months.  So, they gotta pay a little extra for borrowing the money.  That extra is like a little fee for using the phones.  It's like a little bit of extra money for borrowing.

"Okay, so you want to know how much money Vincent saves buying flowers.  

He can get flowers in packs of 3 for $2.50 or in packs of 2 for $1.  So, we gotta figure out which is cheaper.

"Okay, so Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald.  That means Harald sold less.  If they sold 88,000 copies together, we can figure out how many Harald sold.  

Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies.  Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies.  

Together they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write that as an equation: x + 10x = 88,000

Now, let's solve for x: 
11x = 88,000
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Okay, so we got 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons.  That's 8 lessons in all.  And each lesson, they clean the board 3 times.  So, we gotta multiply that by 8.  That's 8 times 3, right?  That's 24 cleanings. 

**Answer:** 24

"Okay, so he plant flowers every day.  He plant 2 flowers a day for 15 days.  That's 2 times 15, that's 30 flowers.  But, some flowers don't grow, so he got 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

"Okay, so Jamal's phone can hold a lot of pictures, right?  Like, a lot!  Brittany's phone, it's smaller, so it can hold less.  We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures.  To figure out how many birds are in the picture, we need to think about how many pictures Brittany's phone can hold.  

Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures.  That's a lot less than Jamal's phone.  So, we need to figure out how many birds are in the picture.  We know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds in Jamal's picture.  So, we can figure out how many birds are in Jamal's picture by dividing the number of pictures on Brittany's phone by 50.  

So, we have 300 pictures on Brittany's phone, and we need to divide that by 50.  That's 300 / 50 = 6.  So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's picture.

"Okay, so we know Katy uses sugar and water in a special way.  It's like a recipe, see?  

We know she uses 7 parts sugar for every 13 parts water.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

To figure out how much water she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the water she used.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar, and that's like 17.14 parts of the recipe.  

So, we need to figure out how many parts of water she used.  We know that for every 7 parts of sugar, she uses 13 parts of water.  So, we can figure out how many parts of water she used by multiplying 17.14 parts of sugar by 13.  

That's 222.82 parts of water.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much Dillon spends.  Watermelons cost three times what peppers cost, right?  So, peppers are like $15 each.  Watermelons are three times that, so they're $15 * 3 = $45 each.  Oranges are five dollars less than watermelons, so they're $45 - $5 = $40 each.

Dillon wants 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.  That's a lot of fruit!

* Watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
* Peppers: 20 * $15 = $300

"Okay, so we got 500 people coming in a day, and each one gets seen for 24 minutes.  That's a lot of people!  So, we gotta figure out how much money we make from them.

First, we gotta figure out how many hours they spend in the hospital.  That's 500 people times 24 minutes each, which is 12,000 minutes.  Now, we gotta figure out how many hours that is.  That's 12,000 minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour, which is 200 hours.

Now, the doctors charge $150 an hour, so we gotta figure out how much they make.  That's 200 hours times $150 an hour, which is $30,000.

The patients pay $200 an hour, so we gotta figure out how much they make.  That's 200 hours times $200 an hour, which is $40,000.

So, the hospital makes $40,000 from the patients and $30,000 from the doctors.  That's a lot of money!

*  We need that for two months, so we double it: 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas. 

**Answer:** 1400

"Okay, so you want to know how much more likely it is Jerry gets a number bigger than 3, right?  

Well, there's 3 numbers bigger than 3, and there's 6 total. So, it's like 3 out of 6.  That's 50%.

But, he could also get two even numbers in a row.  There's 3 even numbers, and he could get one on the first roll, and then another one on the second.  That's 1 out of 2.  So, that's 50% too.

So, it's 50% - 50% = 0.  That means it's the same chance.

"Mom got 20 apples. Jenna got half as many, so she got 20 / 2 = 10 apples. Together, they got 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

**Answer:** 30

"Okay, so we got 160 pieces of straw, and we know the rats got some.  We know the hamsters got 50 pieces, so we have 110 pieces left for the rats.  We know there are 3 cages for the rats, so we can figure out how many rats are in each cage.  We have to divide the 110 pieces by 6 pieces per rat.  That's 110 / 6 = 18.33 rats.  We can't have a fraction of a rat, so we gotta round down.  So, there are 6 rats in each cage.

"Okay, so they went to the fair, right?  They spent some money on tickets, food, and rides.  

* Tickets cost 20.25.
* Food cost 15.75 less than the tickets, so it cost 15.75.
* Rides cost 33 each, and they went on two, so that was 33 * 2 = 66.
* All together, they spent 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102.00.
* So, each person paid 102.00 / 3 = 34.00. 

**Answer:** 34.00

"So, Elaine got a lot of Pokemon cards! 

* First month, she got 20 cards and then she got 3 times that many, so she got 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* Then she got 20 less than that, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* Then she got 2 times the cards from the first two months, so she got 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

* So, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Okay, so we got chocolate and apples, right?  The chocolate is twice as heavy as the apples.  The chocolate is 40 grams each, so the apples are 40 / 2 = 20 grams each.  We got 80 apples, so that's 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.  And we got 25 chocolate bars, and each one is 40 grams, so that's 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.  So the whole bag is 1600 + 1000 = 2600 grams. 

**Answer:** 2600

"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket and shoes.  Shoes cost twenty bucks each, and the jacket is thirty.  She makes five bucks babysitting, and her folks pay her four for mowing the lawn.  She's got ten bucks already.  So, how many times does she gotta mow the lawn?

*  She needs to make 60 bucks.
*  She makes 24 bucks for mowing the lawn.
*  She needs to mow the lawn 60 / 24 = 2.5 times. 
 
So, she needs to mow the lawn 3 times.

"Okay, so Jerry has chickens, right?  Red ones and white ones.  The red ones lay three eggs a day, and the white ones lay five.  Jerry gets 42 eggs every day.  He has more white chickens than red chickens.  How many red chickens does Jerry have?

* A.  10
* B.  12
* C.  14
* D.  I don't know

I think it's a trick question.  Maybe the number of chickens is wrong.  Maybe there's a mistake somewhere.

"Okay, so the park is long and wide, right?  It's like a big rectangle.  To walk all the way around, you gotta go around the whole thing.  So, you gotta go around the long side, then the short side, and so on.  

To figure out how long it takes, you just gotta know how long it is and how fast you walk.  

* **How long is the park?** 1.5 miles
* **How fast do you walk?** 3 miles per hour

So, you gotta go around the whole thing, right?  That's 1.5 miles long, and 6 miles wide.  So, you gotta go around the whole thing.  That's 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 7.5 miles.  

Then you gotta divide that by how fast you walk, which is 3 miles per hour.  So, you gotta go 7.5 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2.5 hours. 

**Answer:** 2.5 hours

"Okay, so the big pool is twice as big as the small pool.  That means the big pool has more water.  But it's leaking out too!  

The big pool is leaking out 4 gallons a minute.  The small pool is leaking out 4 gallons a minute too.  So, they're both losing water.

The big pool is twice as big as the small pool, so it has twice as much water.  

Let's say the small pool has x gallons of water.  The big pool has 2x gallons of water.

The big pool is leaking out 4 gallons a minute, and the small pool is leaking out 4 gallons a minute.  So, in 4 minutes, the big pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.  The small pool loses 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

The big pool has 2x gallons of water, and the small pool has x gallons of water.  The big pool has 2x gallons of water, and the small pool has x gallons of water.  

So, the small pool has x gallons of water.

"Okay, so the sweater has a body, a collar, and a fancy thing on top.  The body takes a lot of stitches, so we know the collar is a tenth of that.  The fancy thing is twice as many as the collar.  So, we know the body is 900 stitches, the collar is 90 stitches, and the fancy thing is 180 stitches.  That's a lot of stitches!  The rest of the sweater is 1800 stitches.

We need 26 trucks.

"Okay, so the fast car is going real fast, like sixty miles an hour.  The slow car is going half as fast, so it's only thirty miles an hour.  We know the fast car went 480 miles, so we need to figure out how long it took the slow car to do that.

The slow car is going thirty miles an hour, so we can figure that out by dividing the distance by the speed.  

480 miles / 30 miles an hour = 16 hours. 

So the slow car took 16 hours to go 480 miles. 


**Answer:** 16

"Okay, so we know the team has 105 players.  The offense has twice as many as the defense, so we gotta figure out how many are on the defense.  

The special teams have half as many as the defense, so we gotta figure out how many are on the defense. 

So, we know the defense has 'x' players.  The offense has 2 times that, so that's 2x.  The special teams have half the defense, so that's x/2.

Now, we add all the players up: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Let's solve for x:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105
(3/2)x = 105
x = 105 * (2/3)
x = 70

So, there are **70** players on the defense.

"Okay, so we know there are 30 boys.  That's a lot of boys!  Girls are three times more than boys, so we have 3 times 30, which is 90 girls.  And then we got some kids that don't have a gender, right?  We know there are 1/10 as many of those as boys, so we have 30 / 10 = 3 of those kids.  So, all together, we got 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 kids that don't have a gender, which is 123 kids in the classroom. 

**Answer:** 123

"Okay, so we know the wires are 45.  And we know for every 1 pole, we need 3 wires.  So, we just need to figure out how many poles we need.  We can do that by dividing the wires by the ratio.  So, 45 wires / 3 = 15 poles. 


**Answer:** 15 
"
"Okay, so we start with 40 people.  Then some people leave.  We know 1/4 of them left.  So, we take 40 and divide it by 4.  That's 10 people.  So now we have 30 people left.  And we know 15 women were there to start.  So, we take 15 and subtract 10.  That's 5 women left. 

**Answer:** 5

"Okay, so the ice makes the coffee colder, right?  It makes it weaker too.  So, the ice makes it weaker by 12 milliliters for every 13 degrees it gets colder.  So, if it gets 65 degrees colder, it gets weaker by 65 * 12 = 780 milliliters.  Then, the cream makes it weaker by 15 milliliters.  So, the coffee is 780 + 15 = 795 milliliters weaker. 

**Answer:** 795 
"
"Okay, so they trade records, right?  They trade two old records for one new one.  So, if they trade 2 old records for 1 new record, and they got 7 new records, that means they traded 7 / 2 = 3.5 old records.  But you can't have half a record, so there's gotta be a mistake.

"Okay, so we got 100 people at the company.  The junior programmers make 2 out of 5 of the people.  So that's 2/5 * 100 = 40 people.  They make 2000 a month.  The senior programmers make 400 more than the junior programmers.  So they make 2000 + 400 = 2400 a month.  So the total for the junior programmers is 40 people * 2000 = 80,000.  The senior programmers are 60 people.  So the total for the senior programmers is 60 people * 2400 = 144,000.  So the total for all the programmers is 80,000 + 144,000 = 224,000.

"Okay, so we got 2 groups, right?  We know they're the same size.  So we got 2 groups, and we know the other group is smaller.  We know the other group is 10 less than the other two.  So we just gotta figure out how many kids are in the smaller group. 

The total number of kids is 200.  We know the other two groups are the same size, so we just gotta figure out how many kids are in the smaller group. 

So, we know the other two groups are 2 times the number of kids in the smaller group.  So we can say that 2 times the number of kids in the smaller group is 200.  We can also say that the smaller group is 10 less than the other two groups.  So we can say that the smaller group is 200 - 10 = 190. 

So the answer is 190.

"Carver is 45 years old.  Twice his age is 90. Five less than twice his age is 85.  So his son is 85 - 5 = 80 years old. 

**Answer: 80** 
"
"Okay, so the train goes a long way, right?  It goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 less than that.  So it goes 50 miles less than 100 miles.  That's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.  So the whole trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.  The train goes that far every day, so it goes 225 miles every day.  To know how many days it takes to go 18,000 miles, we need to divide 18,000 by 225.  That's 18,000 / 225 = 80 days.  So the train needs service every 80 days. 

**Answer: 80** 
"
"Okay, so we got Rottweiler beds, chihuahua beds, and collie beds.  The collie beds need a little bit of stuffing, right?  We need to figure out how much stuffing we need for the collie beds.  

The chihuahua beds need 2 pounds of stuffing, and the Rottweiler beds need 8 pounds.  So, the average is 2 + 8 / 2 = 5 pounds.  

We need to make 3 collie beds, so we need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

We also need to make 4 chihuahua beds, so we need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

So, we need 15 + 8 = 23 pounds of stuffing. 

**Answer:** 23

The answer is 48. 
 
 
"
"Okay, so we got six girls.  Twice the number of boys is like, double, right? So we got 6 girls times two, that's twelve boys.  So, we got 6 girls + 12 boys, that's 18 kids in the park.

"Okay, so she writes a song for four hours, then she records it for two hours.  That's a total of six hours.  She spends 90 minutes editing.  To figure out what percentage of the time she spent editing, we need to know how many minutes are in a whole hour.  There are 60 minutes in an hour.  So, 90 minutes is equal to 90/60 = 1.5 hours.  So, she spent 1.5 hours editing.  To figure out what percentage of the time she spent editing, we need to divide the time she spent editing by the total time she spent on the whole project.  That's 1.5 hours / 6 hours = 0.25.  That's 25%. 

**Answer:** 25%

"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses, right?  They eat a lot of oats, like five pounds each time.  He feeds them twice a day, so that's ten pounds a horse each day.  Now, he needs oats for five days, so we need to figure out how many bags of oats he needs.  

He needs 40 pounds of oats a day, so for five days, that's 40 pounds a day * 5 days = 200 pounds.  Each bag has 50 pounds, so he needs 200 pounds / 50 pounds per bag = 4 bags. 


**Answer:** 4

"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies.  Two-thirds of them are Pomeranians.  That's like, a lot of puppies!  One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.  So, how many girls are Pomeranians?  That's easy!  Just take one-third of the Pomeranians, which is like, half of them.  So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians. 


**Answer:** 6

"Okay, so we got the highest temps from all the countries.  The coldest is -48, then 21, and then -3.  To find the average, we gotta add 'em all up.  That's -48 + 21 + (-3) = -20.  Now we gotta divide that by how many countries we got.  So, -20 / 3 = -6.67.  That's the answer! 


**Final answer: -6.67**

"Okay, so Ashley got 5 boxes of oranges, right?  That's 50 oranges. Brianne got more, but I think she got 20 more than Ashley.  So, she got 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.  Now, we need to see how many pies we can make.  We need 3 oranges for each pie, so we divide the total oranges by 3.  That's 120 oranges / 3 oranges per pie = 40 pies. 

**Answer:** 40

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many people Mark needs to bring to make the two places the same price. 

* **Venue 1:**  It's like this, you pay $200 no matter how many people come.  
* **Venue 2:**  It's like this, you pay $25 for each person.

So, we gotta find out how many people make the two places the same price. 

* **Venue 1:**  $200 + $5 * people = $25 * people
* **Venue 2:**  $25 * people = $200 + $5 * people

So, we can see that the two places are the same price when $200 + $5 * people = $25 * people. 

We can solve for people: $200 + $5 * people = $25 * people
$200 = $20 * people
people = 10

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many popsicle sticks he can make.  

He got two kinds of wood, right?  The big one and the small one.  The big one is cheaper, so we gotta use that.

He can buy 6 of the big ones, 'cause that's how much money he got.  

So, he can make 6 times 200 sticks, right?  That's 1200 sticks! 


**Answer:** 1200

"Okay, so we got six dogs, right?  And each dog needs two feet, so we need to get three pairs of snowshoes.  That's how many we need.  Each pair is $12.00, so we need to multiply that by three.  That's $36.00. 

**Answer:** $36.00

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. How many animals do the farm and zoo have together?

A. 50
B. 120
C. 100
D. 40

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep. The farm and zoo have a total of 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals.

"Okay, so the dinner cost $50.  We gotta give the waiter 20% extra.  That's like, 20 out of 100.  So, we add that to the $50.  That's $50 plus 20.  So, it's $50 plus 10.  That's $60.  So, I paid $60. 

**Answer:** $60

"Okay, so Elvis wants to save a lot of money, right?  He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.  So, he needs to save $1125 for the whole month.  

To figure out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we need to figure out how much he saves each day in the first half.  He needs to save $1125 / 15 days = $75 per day in the second half. 


**Answer:** $75

"Okay, so you want to know how many people get called, right?  

So, Ali calls 3 people.  Then each of those people calls 3 more people.  That's like a chain, right?  So, the first person calls 3, then the second person calls 3, and so on.  

So, the fourth round is like this:

* **Round 1:** Ali calls 3 people.
* **Round 2:** Each of those 3 people calls 3 more people.

"Okay, so I need notebooks, pens, a calculator, and a geometry set.  

* Notebooks: Five of them cost $7.50 each, so that's $7.50 * 5 = $37.50

* Calculator: One calculator costs $12.00
* Geometry set: One set costs $10.00

So, that's $37.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

The store gives me a discount, so I get $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

"Okay, so the carpet is 18 feet by 12 feet.  That's a big room!  It'll cost a lot of money.  

* Carpet: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet
* Carpet cost: 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592
* Padding: 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432
* Taking out the old carpet: 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864
* Putting down the new carpet: 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7456
* Total cost: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7456 = $11344 

So, it'll cost Michael $11,344 to replace the carpet.

"Okay, so the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  The note says there's 1% less red than blue, and 1% more green than blue.  So, we gotta figure out how many of each there are.

Let's say there are 'b' jelly beans that are blue.  That means there's 1% less red, so there's 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.  And there's 1% more green than blue, so there's 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

So, we know:

* Blue jelly beans = b
* Red jelly beans = 0.99 * b
* Green jelly beans = 1.01 * b

The total jelly beans is the sum of all three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Now, we can solve for 'b':

* Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
* Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans.  

Now, we can figure out how many green jelly beans there are:

* Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

There are 1515 green jelly beans.  

So, there are 1515 - 1500 = 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Okay, so Jared is getting faster at typing.  He goes from 47 words a minute to 52, and then he goes up some more.  So, he's going to be 57 words a minute.  

To find the average, we add all the numbers together and then divide by three.  That's 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then we divide that by three, which is 156 / 3 = 52.

* **Cheerios:** 1.25 pounds a week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
* **Donuts:** 1.75 pounds a week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds
* **Difference:** 8.75 pounds - 6.25 pounds = 2.5 pounds

So, Martin loses 2.5 pounds.

"The truck cost $30,000.  Then, the king cab is $7,500.  Leather seats are a third of that, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

"Okay, so we got two kinds of animals, sheep and geese.  We know they got 70 legs all together.  And we know they got 20 heads.

* **Geese legs:** Geese got 2 legs each.

So, we can write this like this: 4 times the number of sheep plus 2 times the number of geese equals 70.

We also know that the number of sheep plus the number of geese equals 20.

So, we can solve for the number of sheep.

"The cat is fast, real fast!  The turtle is slow, but the cat is five times faster.  So, the turtle is slow, like a snail.  If the cat runs 15 feet in one second, the turtle crawls 3 feet in one second.  So, the turtle crawls 3 feet for 40 seconds.  That's 3 feet * 40 seconds = 120 feet. 

**Answer:** 120

"Okay, so we know there were 33 people on the council.  And the votes were split, right?  Twice as many people voted for it as against it.  So, if there were 'x' people against it, then twice as many people voted for it.  That means there were 2 times 'x' people for it.  So, we know that x + 2x = 33.  That means 3x = 33.  So, x is 33 divided by 3, which is 11.  So, there were 11 people against it.  That means there were 2 times 11, which is 22 people for it. 


**Answer: 22**

Then we got 9 kids need large shirts.  Six more than that is 9 + 6 = 15 kids.  So, all together we got 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 kids.  

**Answer:** 65

"Peaches cost $2.00 a pound, plums cost $1.00 a pound, and apricots cost $3.00 a pound.  So, Winston spent $12.00 on peaches, $8.00 on plums, and $18.00 on apricots.  That's a total of $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00. 

**Answer:** $38.00

"Okay, so they drove for six hours, right?  That's a long drive!  They drove 50 miles an hour, so they drove 50 miles * 6 hours = 300 miles.  Then they hiked for 1.5 hours.  They hiked 20 miles an hour, so they hiked 20 miles * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.  So, the whole trip was 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.  That's the answer! 

**Answer:** 330

"Okay, so Ava and Emma are playing this game, right?  They're trying to see who's the best.  They get points for jumping on bad guys, berries, and time.  

* **Jumping on bad guys:**  They get points for how many bad guys they jump on.
* **Berries:**  They get points for berries they find.
* **Time:**  They get points for how long they take to finish the game.

Ava is good at this game, so she's gonna get more points.  She jumps on more bad guys, finds more berries, and takes longer to finish.  Emma is not as good, so she's gonna get less points.

So, how much difference is there between their scores?  I think it's gonna be a big difference!

"Okay, so Andy's car goes 10 miles per gallon, right?  That means he uses 5 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 0.5 gallons of gas to go to work every day.  That's 0.5 gallons * 5 days = 2.5 gallons a week.  And that'll cost him $7.50 for gas. 

**Answer:** $7.50

"Okay, so he has tomato plants and eggplant plants.  Tomatoes, he gets 5 times 22, that's 110 tomatoes.  Eggplant, he gets 8 times 4, that's 32 eggplants.  So, he gets 110 tomatoes and 32 eggplants.  That's a lot of fruits! 

**Answer:** 142

"Okay, so we know smart TVs are one-fourth of the TVs sold, and analog TVs are one-eighth.  That means the rest are OLED TVs.  So, if we have 40 TVs, we can figure out how many are OLEDs. 

* Smart TVs: 40 TVs / 4 = 10 TVs
* Analog TVs: 40 TVs / 8 = 5 TVs
* Total Smart and Analog TVs: 10 TVs + 5 TVs = 15 TVs
* OLED TVs: 40 TVs - 15 TVs = 25 TVs 

So, they sold 25 OLED TVs. 
 
**Answer:** 25

"Okay, so Tanya makes a scrub, right?  She uses salt, oil, and stuff like that.  She makes a jar full, right?  So, she uses the same amount of zest as the fragrance, and the same amount of salt as the sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

So, how much oil does she use?  

* **A.**  She uses 2 ounces of oil.
* **B.**  She uses 4 ounces of oil.
* **C.**  She uses 6 ounces of oil.
* **D.**  She uses 8 ounces of oil.

"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day, right?  Then she walked for half as long the next day, which is 4 hours.  That's a lot of walking!  So, how long did she walk in total?  That's 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.  That's a whole lot of walking!  To figure out how long it took her, we just multiply that by 60 minutes per hour.  That's 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.  So the answer is 720. 


**Answer:** 720

"Okay, so Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have cards, right?  We know Becca has more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has more than PJ.  Let's figure out how many cards Becca has.

* **PJ has the most cards, right?**  So, PJ has 'x' cards.
* **Smendrick has three times PJ's cards, so he has 3 times 'x' cards.**
* **Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3 times 'x' + 12 cards.**

Now, we know all the cards together is 341.  So, we can write that as:

* **x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341**

Let's solve for 'x' to find out how many cards PJ has.

* **7x + 12 = 341**
* **7x = 329**
* **x = 47**

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can figure out how many Becca has.

* **Becca has 3 times PJ's cards plus 12.**
* **Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153**

So, Becca has 153 cards.

"Cindy got a lot of eggs!  She had 5 green ones, and twice as many blue ones as green ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.  Then she had 9 pink eggs, and that's one less than the blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she had 3 yellow eggs, 'cause that's one-third of the pink eggs.  So, all together, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Okay, so the book is heavy, right?  It's four pounds.  And it cost thirty-two dollars.  They charge you for the weight and the miles, right?  So, the weight is four pounds, and that's four times the price they charge per pound, which is thirty-five cents.  That's one dollar and forty cents.  Then, the miles are twenty miles, and they charge you eight cents per mile.  That's sixteen cents.  So, that's one dollar and forty cents plus sixteen cents.  That's two dollars and forty cents.  But, they only give you back seventy-five percent of the price, so they give you twenty-four dollars.  So, Milly loses two dollars and forty cents.

* Chandeliers: She has two chandeliers, and they cost $15 each to hang.  That's two times $15, which is $30.
* Pictures: She has twenty pictures, and they cost $15 each to hang.  That's twenty times $15, which is $300.

So, all together, it'll cost her $90 + $30 + $300 = $420.

"So, Isaias wants to make $2000. He has 300 chickens, and he's gonna sell 3/5 of them.  That means he's gonna sell 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.  He's gonna make $50 per chicken, so he'll make $50 * 180 = $9000.  But he wants to make $2000 profit, so he spent $9000 - $2000 = $7000 on the chickens. 


**Answer:** $7000

"Julie sold 14 glasses. Micah sold 14 too.  So, Julie sold 14 - 14 = 0 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, so she got her hair done for $400.  That's a lot of money!  Then she got her nails done for a little less, like a quarter of that.  That's $400 / 4 = $100.  And then she got her feet done, and that cost a little more than her nails, like three-quarters of what her nails cost.  So that's $100 * 3 / 4 = $75.  So, all together, she spent $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.  That's a lot of money! 

**Answer:** $575 
"
"Okay, so Sarah has a rope, right?  It's 20 meters long.  She sells it for $2 a meter.  That means she makes $20.  Then she wants to buy a new rope, and it costs $1.50 a meter.  So, how much money does she have left?  

**Answer:**  She has $19 left.

"Okay, so Melanie is 8 years old now.  In 10 years, she'll be 18.  So, she's gonna be 18 in 10 years.  To make her age three times what it is now, we need to figure out how many years it'll take for her to be 24.  So, we need to find out how many years it'll take for her to be 24.  That's 24 - 8 = 16 years.  So, it'll take her 16 years. 


**Answer:** 16

"Okay, so Kelly got bacon, chicken, and apples.  Bacon cost $10, and chicken cost twice as much as bacon, so that's $20.  Strawberries cost $4 each, and she got 3 packs, so that's $12.  Apples cost $2 each, and she got 7 packs, so that's $14.  That's a lot of money, right?  So, she spent $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56.  She had $65, and now she spent $56, so she has $65 - $56 = $9 left. 


**Final answer:** $9

"Okay, so we got 50 microphones.  We gotta put 'em in pairs, right?  But some don't fit, so we gotta figure out how many pairs we can make.  

* 20% of the microphones don't fit.  That's like 10 microphones.
* We got 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones left.
* We can put 40 microphones in pairs, so that's 40 microphones / 2 microphones per pair = 20 pairs. 


**Answer:** 20

"Okay, so we got 100 plants.  Half of them are inside, right? That's 100 / 4 = 25.  Then we got the rest, 100 - 25 = 75.  Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 75 * (2/3) = 50.  So, the rest are flowers, 75 - 50 = 25.  That means 25 is the flowers.  So, 25 / 100 is 25%.  That's the answer. 


**Answer:** 25%

"Okay, so we need to make 20 small masks and 8 big masks.

"Okay, so we got 10,000 gallons of water in the pool.  The pump fills the tank, and that tank is half the size of the pool. So the tank gets 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.  Then they pump out some water, and that's 5,000 / 2 = 2,500 gallons.  After six days, the tank will be empty. 


**Answer:** 2,500

"Okay, so he made a lot of mini rolls and muffins.  

* Rolls: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Muffins: 300 mini muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories
* Total: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories 

So, that's a lot of calories! 
 
**Answer:** 85,000

"Okay, so she picks Junebugs every day.  On Monday she got 39.  Tuesday and Wednesday she got twice as many as Monday, so that's 39 * 2 = 78.  Then on Thursday she got 48 and Friday she got 57.  So, all together she got 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 192 Junebugs.  That's a lot of bugs!  To find the average, we just take all the bugs and divide by how many days she picked them.  So, 192 bugs / 5 days = 38.4 bugs a day.  That's the answer! 

**Answer:** 38.4

"Okay, so we know the three people are 100 years old.  Let's figure out Peter's age.

* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter is the same age as Paul and John put together.

So, we know:

* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter is the same age as Paul and John put together.

Let's say John is 'J' years old.  Then Paul is 'J + 10' years old.  And Peter is 'J + 10 + J' years old.

Now, we know that all three of them are 100 years old.  So, we can write an equation:

J + (J + 10) + (J + 10 + J) = 100

Let's solve for J:

3J + 20 = 100
3J = 80
J = 26.67

Now we can find Peter's age:

Peter is J + 10 + J
Peter is 26.67 + 10 + 26.67
Peter is 63.34

So, Peter is 63.34 years old. 



**Final answer:** 63.34

"Okay, so Zoey and Sydney are spitting watermelon seeds.  They each got a big watermelon. Zoey spits 40 seeds, and each one goes 10 feet. Sydney has 35 seeds, and each one goes 12 feet.  To find out who spits the most seeds, we gotta add up how far they spit. Zoey spits 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.  So, together they spit 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.  That's a lot of seeds!  The average is 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.  So the answer is 410 feet.

"Okay, so we got goats and sheep, right? Goats need 5 pounds each, and sheep need less.  We gotta figure out how much hay we need for all of 'em.

* Goats: 15 of 'em, each need 5 pounds, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.
* Sheep: 12 of 'em, each need 7 pounds less than twice the goat's need, so that's 7 * 12 = 84 pounds.
* Total: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

So we need 159 pounds of hay.

"Okay, so Bahati scored the most, right?  He got 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar.  So, Azibo scored less than Bahati.  

Let's say Dinar scored X.  Then Azibo scored X - 10.  Bahati scored X + 10.  

Now, all three of them together scored 45 points.  So, we can write an equation:

X + (X - 10) + (X + 10) = 45

Let's solve for X:

3X = 45
X = 15

So, Dinar scored 15 points.  

Now, Azibo scored X - 10, which is 15 - 10 = 5 points.

He can make 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.  So the answer is 7.

Then we can figure out what percentage of the watermelon the adults get.

"Doctor Jones has a lot to do! He's got to check on all the people in the hospital. That takes a long time. He's got to go see ten people, each for thirty minutes. That's a lot of time! Then he has to check on all the people in the hospital. That takes a long time too. 

He has 9 people to check on. That's a lot of people! 

He has 60 minutes left to do his other stuff.

"Okay, so the cake needs to be done by 5 o'clock.  That's a long time to bake.  We gotta start early!  

The cake takes 20 minutes to make, then 30 minutes to bake, and then it needs to cool for a long time, like two hours.  That's a lot of time!  And then it needs frosting.  

So, we gotta start at 1:00 pm to make the cake before 5:00 pm. 


**Answer:** 1:00 pm

"Okay, so Lisa and Peter sold chocolate bars, right?  They sold 64 of 'em together.  They sold in boxes, so we need to figure out how many bars are in each box.  

Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes.  That's a lot of boxes!  So, we need to figure out how many bars are in each box. 

We know they sold 64 bars total.  So, we can figure out how many bars are in each box.

"Okay, so the dance studio costs $25 to rent and then $1.50 for each student.  So, if they have 10 students, it's $25 plus $15 for the students.  They do it three days a week, so that's 12 times a month.  So, they make $480 a month. 

**Answer:** $480

"Okay, so we got 50 porcupines.  And half of them are girls, so that's 30 girls.  Every month, the girls have babies, and they have four babies each.  So, in a year, they have 120 babies.  That's a lot of babies!  So, we add the girls and the babies, and we get 50 plus 120, which is 170 porcupines. 

**Answer:** 170

"Okay, so the pool is big, right?  It's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  We gotta fill it up!  

To figure out how much water we need, we gotta multiply the length, the width, and the depth.  That's 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet.  That's a lot of water!

Now, we gotta figure out how much it costs to fill it.  It's $0.10 per gallon, so we just multiply the amount of water we need by that.  That's 10392 gallons * $0.10.  That's a lot of money!

So, it'll cost $1039.20 to fill the pool. 


**Answer:** $1039.20

"Okay, so we got red sticks, and then we got blue sticks, and then yellow sticks.  We got 9 red sticks.  Then we got 5 more blue sticks than red, so we got 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  And then we got 3 less yellow sticks than blue, so we got 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  So, we got 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.  

**Answer:** 34

"So, there's a chance the teacher won't give us homework, right?  That's 50%.  And if she does give us homework, there's a chance she'll give us an extension.  That's 40%.  So, if we don't get an extension, there's a chance we have to do the homework.  That's 20%.  But, if we don't get an extension, there's a chance we can tell the teacher our dog ate it.  That's 20% too.  So, the chance we have to do the homework is 20% plus 20% plus 8%.  That's 48%.  So the answer is 48%.

"Okay, so we got 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks.  That's a lot of painting!  So, we gotta figure out how many hours that is.  

We know there are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.  So, we got 21 days of painting.

Now, we know each painter works 3/8 of a day, so we gotta figure out how many hours that is.  That's 3/8 * 24 hours = 9 hours.

So, each painter worked 9 hours.

"Okay, so we got 50 books in the library. Half of 'em are English, so that's 25.  Then we got 10% German, which is 5 books.  So, that's 25 + 5 = 30 books in English and German.  The rest, the rest are Spanish, right?  So, we got 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books. 

**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so you want to know how far Bernice needs to drive, right?  

She's already driven 1300 kilometers.  To get to New York, she needs to drive the rest of the way, which is 1955 kilometers - 1300 kilometers = 655 kilometers. 

So the answer is 655 kilometers. 
"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water a day.  That's a lot of water!  To figure out how much water she drinks in 30 days, we need to know how many gallons that is.  

A gallon has 16 cups, so we can do this: 8 cups a day / 16 cups per gallon = 0.5 gallons a day.  

Now, we need to see how many days she drinks water for.  So, 0.5 gallons a day * 30 days = 15 gallons. 

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. 

**Answer:** 15 
"
"Okay, so the train starts with 120 people. Then, 20 more get on.  So now it's 120 + 20 = 140 people.  Then, some get off, 50, and then more get on, twice the number that got off.  So, that's 50 * 2 = 100 people get on.  Then, 80 more get off.  So, we have 140 - 50 + 100 + 80 = 350 people on the train. 

**Answer: 350** 
"
"Okay, so she got a tank top for $10. Then she got shorts for $10 plus five more, so that was $15.  The shoes were on sale, so they cost $24.  Then she got socks for $2 off, so that was $49. 

**Answer:** $49 
"
"Okay, so you need tiles for your kitchen floor.  You got a big floor, 200 square feet.  Each tile is one foot by one foot.  So you need 200 of them.  That'll cost you $12 a tile.  So, you'll need $12 times 200, which is $2400. 

**Answer:** $2400 
"
"Okay, so James' insurance went up 60%.  That means it cost him $120 a month, and now it's $120 plus 60% more.  So, it's $120 plus 60 dollars.  That's $120 plus 72 dollars.  So, it's $192 a month.  And that's a whole year, so it's $192 times 12 months.  That's $2304 a year. 

**Answer:** $2304

"So, Marcel sells bikes, right?  He sells MTBs, BMXs, and Trekking bikes.  The MTBs are the big ones, the BMXs are smaller, and the Trekking bikes are for going on long rides.

He sold 300 bikes in total.  Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes.  That means the rest were MTBs.

* MTBs: 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 bikes
* MTBs are the big ones, so they make the most money.

He made $500 for each MTB, so he made 105 bikes * $500 = $52,500 from MTBs.

The BMXs were half the price of the MTBs, so he made 45 bikes * $500 / 2 = $11,250 from BMXs.

The Trekking bikes were $450 each, so he made 150 bikes * $450 = $6,750 from Trekking bikes.

So, he made a total of $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500 from selling all the bikes. 


**Answer:** $70,500

"Okay, so Nik has a lot of crayons, right? He wants to put 'em in boxes.  Each box is heavy, like 8 ounces.  Each crayon is small, like 1 ounce.  So, how many boxes does he need?  

* 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.  That's a lot of boxes!
*  He needs 25 boxes.
*  Now, how much do those boxes weigh?  Each box is 8 ounces.
*  So, 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.
*  And how much do all the crayons weigh?  Each crayon is 1 ounce.
*  So, 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.
*  Now, we add up all the crayons and the boxes.  200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.
*  And we need to know how many pounds that is.  400 ounces is like 25 pounds. 


**Answer:** 25 pounds

"Okay, so the tree is 80 feet long.  He cuts it up into 4 foot pieces.  That's a lot of pieces!  He makes 5 planks from each piece.  So, he makes 80 planks.  He sells each plank for $1.2.  That's a lot of money!  He makes $96.00. 

**Answer:** $96.00 
"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000, and her brother makes twice that, so he makes $10000.  Their mom makes twice their total, so she makes $30000.  That's a lot of money!  All together, they have $15000 + $30000 = $45000. 

**Answer:** $45000

"Okay, so the tree gets bigger and bigger, right?  

*  A little tree is small, makes 50 fruits.
*  When it's six years old, it makes three times as many as the little tree.
*  When it's seven years old, it makes seven times as many as the little tree.
*  When it's eight years old, it makes less than the seven-year-old tree, but not as much as the ten-year-old.
*  The tree doesn't make any fruit in the ninth year.
*  The ten-year-old tree makes a lot of fruit, twenty times as much as the little tree.

So, how many fruits does the tree make in all?

**Answer:** 20

"Okay, so the teacher used up a lot of chalk on Monday.  He used more than usual, so he used 45% of the chalk.  He only uses 20% each day, so he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.  That means he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk left.  He can use that chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many pizzas Kate needs.  She eats a lot of cheese and pepperoni!

* Cheese: She eats 6 slices of cheese, and each pizza has 12 slices. So she needs 6 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas.  But we can't buy half a pizza, so she needs 1 whole pizza.
* Pepperoni: She eats 4 slices of pepperoni, and each pizza has 8 slices. So she needs 4 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas.  Again, we can't buy half a pizza, so she needs 1 whole pizza.

So, Kate needs 1 cheese pizza and 1 pepperoni pizza. 


**Answer:** 1, 1

"Okay, so Jen works a lot, right?  She works 7.5 hours a day, six days a week. That's a lot of work!  She gets $1.50 an hour, so she makes $11.25 a day.  And she gets $10 for being there every day.  So, she makes $11.25 a day * 6 days a week = $67.50 a week.  That's a lot of money!  She gets $10 for being there every day, so she makes $67.50 + $10 = $77.50 a week. 

**Answer:** $77.50

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many mugs are in the teacher's room.  

Let's say there are 'x' mugs.  Four times that many is 4x.  Eight more than that is 4x + 8.  

We know that 4x + 8 is equal to 40.  So, we can solve for x.

4x + 8 = 40
4x = 32
x = 8

So, there are 8 mugs in the teacher's room.

"Okay, so Carly makes cupcakes and brownies.  She makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes.  So, she makes brownies.  We know she has 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats.  So, she has to make enough for 10 treats.  

Let's think about it like this:

*  Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes.
*  She makes 'b' brownies.

We know that b = 3c - 2.

We also know that 5 people get 2 treats each.  So, that's 10 treats.

So, we can say that c + b = 10.

Now, we can use the equation b = 3c - 2 to help us.  Let's substitute that in:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve for c:

4c - 2 = 10
4c = 12
c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Okay, so Rose got a lot of eggs.  She got 60 eggs.  She sells them for a dollar a dozen.  So, she sells 60 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 5 dozen.  She sells 5 dozen for $1 a dozen.  That's $5.  But she spent $144 on the eggs.  So, she lost $144 - $5 = $139.  So, she lost $139. 


**Final answer:** -$139 
"
"Okay, so we got 100 hats, right? Half are red, so that's 50 red hats.  Then we got 50 left.  

Of the rest, 3 out of 5 are blue.  So that's 30 blue hats.

The rest are white, so we got 50 - 30 = 20 white hats. 

**Answer:** 20 
"
"So, the jerky is $15.00 for a bag of 30 sticks.  That's a good deal, right?  If it's on sale for $3.00 off, it's only $12.00.  So, each stick is $12.00 / 30 sticks = $0.40 per stick.  That's 40 cents! 

**Answer:** 40

So, he's talkin' 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.  That's a lot of words!  

To figure out how long it takes him, we gotta figure out how many words he's talkin' in total.  Then we can figure out how long it takes him to say all of that.

4500 words / 375 words/minute = 12 minutes.

The total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.  

Now, we know that we need to push the car, and the force is like 1% of the weight.  So, we just multiply the weight by 1%.  That's 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds. 

So, we need to push with 16 pounds.

"Okay, so the radiator cost $400, but they gave him a good deal, right?  He got it for 80% off, so it was only $320.  Then the mechanic had to put it in, and it took him three hours.  That's $150 for the mechanic.  So, he paid $320 for the radiator and $150 for the mechanic, that's $470. 

**Answer:** $470 
"
"Okay, so we got 20 animals, right?  And they got 70 legs.  

Chickens got 2 legs, cows got 4.  So we gotta figure out how many chickens there are. 

* **If we have 20 animals, and they all are chickens or cows, we can say that the number of chickens is 5.** 

So the answer is 5. 



"
"Okay, so we got 7 pizzas, right?  Each one has 8 slices.  So we got 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.  Then we got 4 people, so we gotta divide the slices up.  So each person gets 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices.  

**Answer:** 14
