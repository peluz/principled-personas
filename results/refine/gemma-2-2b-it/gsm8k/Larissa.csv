"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162.  

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  To determine the number of gold coins, we need to consider the relationship between silver and gold coins.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent this relationship with the following equation:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**

To find the number of silver coins, we can use the total number of coins:

* **Total coins = Silver coins + Gold coins**
* **110 = Silver coins + (Silver coins + 30)**

Simplifying the equation:

* **110 = 2 * Silver coins + 30**
* **80 = 2 * Silver coins**
* **Silver coins = 40**

Now, we can calculate the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = Silver coins + 30**
* **Gold coins = 40 + 30**
* **Gold coins = 70**

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

"To determine the number of wins, we need to consider the relationship between wins and losses.  Since the team won 8 more than they lost, we can represent this mathematically as:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**

We know the total number of games played is 22.  Let's represent the number of losses as 'x'.  

* **x + (x + 8) = 22**

Combining like terms:

* **2x + 8 = 22**

Solving for 'x':

* **2x = 14**
* **x = 7**

Therefore, the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we use the formula:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**
* **Wins = 7 + 8**
* **Wins = 15**

"Let's break down this coffee ratio problem.  

We know Katy's coffee recipe uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13.  This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.

To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to use the ratio to find the value of one part.  

* We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.
*  Let's represent the value of one part of the ratio as 'x'. 
*  We can set up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons

Solving for x:
*  Divide both sides by 7: x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately)

This means that one part of the ratio represents 17.14 teaspoons of sugar. 

To find the total teaspoons of sugar used, we multiply the value of one part by the total amount of sugar used:

* **Adrien's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was $40,000.
* **Adrien's salary now:**  His salary increased by 40%, so his salary now is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.
* **Lylah's salary four years ago:**  We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30.  Solving for Lylah's salary, we get $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).
* **Lylah's salary now:**  Her salary increased by 40% as well, so her salary now is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).
* **Total salary four years later:**  Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Seth's current age be represented by 'S'.
* Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'.

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:**
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"Zaid has a monthly income of $6000.  Let's break down his expenses:

* **Rent:** $6000 * (1/4) = $1500
* **Car Fuel:** $6000 * (1/3) = $2000
* **Total Expenses:** $1500 + $2000 = $3500

After covering these expenses, he has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He then donates half of this remaining amount to charity, leaving him with $2500 / 2 = $1250.

Finally, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. This leaves him with $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350.

"To determine the total number of crabs, we need to consider the relationships between the crabs owned by Bo, Monic, and Rani. 

* **Bo's crabs:** Bo has 40 crabs.
* **Monic's crabs:** Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so she has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* **Rani's crabs:** Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so she has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Finally, to find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. 

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used with the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:** 10 cages of hamsters are given 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total, and 50 pieces were used with hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We need to divide the remaining straw (110 pieces) by the number of rats to find the number of rats per cage. 
* **Rat per Cage:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats. 
* **Rounding:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The problem presents a classic scenario where a system of equations is used to solve for the unknown number of chickens.  Let's break it down:

* **Eggs per day:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Chicken ratio:** The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve for the number of red chickens, we can use the following steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.
   * We know: r + w = total chickens
   * We know: 3r + 5w = total eggs

2. **Express 'r' in terms of 'w':**
   * The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write: r = w + 2

3. **Substitute 'r' into the first equation:**
   * Substitute (w + 2) for 'r' in the equation 3r + 5w = total eggs.
   * This gives us: 3(w + 2) + 5w = total eggs

4. **Solve for 'w':**
   * Simplify and solve the equation. 
   * 3w + 6 + 5w = total eggs
   * 8w + 6 = total eggs
   * 8w = total eggs - 6
   * w = (total eggs - 6) / 8

5. **Substitute 'w' back into the equation r = w + 2:**
   *  r = (total eggs - 6) / 8 + 2

**Important Note:**  The problem statement is not entirely clear.  It's impossible to have a fractional number of chickens.  The number of chickens must be a whole number.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the park.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.  To find the time it takes him to walk the perimeter, we use the following formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour.  Therefore:

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"To calculate the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the fact that their ages will increase by three years. 

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

**Calculating the average age in three years:**

* **Future ages:**
    * Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years old
    * Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old
    * Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years old
* **Average age:** (24 + 66 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years old

**Therefore, the average age of the three in three years will be 45 years old.**

"To determine the probability of a randomly selected card being a water type, we need to consider the current number of water type Pokemon and the total number of Pokemon. 

James has 32 water type Pokemon remaining after losing 8.  He started with 40 water type Pokemon.  

The probability of picking a water type card is:

* **Probability = (Number of water type Pokemon) / (Total number of Pokemon)**
* Probability = 32 / 90

This simplifies to approximately 0.356.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is **36%**.

"To determine the time it takes to complete the puzzle, we need to consider the rate at which each individual can solve the puzzle. 

Kalinda can solve 4 pieces per minute, while her mom solves half as many, at 2 pieces per minute.  

Therefore, their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it takes to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute):

Time = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Therefore, it will take them 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

"The total cost for Mark's fleet of cars is calculated as follows:

* **Cost of the cars:** 12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000
* **Sales tax:** $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000
* **Total cost before registration:** $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000
* **Total cost including registration:** $264,000 + ($1000/car * 12 cars) = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

"To determine the number of cherry tomato vines Steve needs, we need to consider his daily consumption and the yield per vine. 

He eats 6 tomatoes per day, and each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.  

To calculate the total tomatoes needed, we multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total tomatoes needed by the yield per vine: 42 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs **14** vines.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Fries:** Griffin started with 24 french fries.
* **Kyle's Take:** Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
* **Billy's Take:** Billy took twice the number Kyle took, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
* **Colby's Take:** Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
* **Final Tally:** Griffin had 19 fries after Kyle and Billy took their fries, and Colby took 2.  Ginger's contribution is the difference between Griffin's final count and the number of fries he had after Colby's take.  Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 2 = 25 fries.


**Answer:** Ginger gave Griffin 25 fries.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know the difference in snail populations between the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both.  

*  The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.
*  We need to find the number of fish in each aquarium.

Since the difference in snails is twice the number of fish, we can set up an equation: 28 = 2 * x. 

Solving for x, we get x = 14. 

Therefore, each aquarium has 14 fish.

"The oil requires a specific heating profile for optimal cooking.  

* **Heating to 400 degrees:**  The oil takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees, so it takes 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes.
* **Cooking time:**  The oil takes 5 minutes less to cook than it took to warm up, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

**Total time:** 20 minutes (heating) + 28 minutes (heating to 400) + 23 minutes (cooking) = **71 minutes**

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to calculate the total number of spots for each snake species. 

* Cobras have 70 spots each, and there are 40 cobras in the park. Therefore, the total number of spots for cobras is 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.
* Mambas have 35 spots each, and there are 60 mambas in the park. The total number of spots for mambas is 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.
* The total number of spots for all snakes is 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 5,000 pounds.

To determine the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck: 5,000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks.

Since we can't have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we will need **3 trucks** to transport the flagstones.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, or 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

* Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business attire, luggage, and a flight ticket.  To determine how much he can allocate to gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip expenses.

* **Money remaining for gifts:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650

**Therefore, Theo has $3650 remaining to spend on gifts.**

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate than Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $30,000

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size.  The third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the three groups is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this value of 'c' into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60

Combining like terms:
* 3w = 60

Solving for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' (the number of chickens):
* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* Total legs: 80 + 80 = 160

Therefore, the animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs.

"To figure out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to consider the cost of each activity and the total budget. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person. 
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

Let's use a simple equation to represent the total cost:

* **Total Cost = (Cost per person for mini-golf) * (Number of friends) + (Cost per ride for go-karts) * (Number of rides)**

We know the total budget is $90.  Let's plug in the values and solve for the number of friends:

* $90 = ($5 * number of friends) + ($10 * number of rides)

To find the number of friends, we need to figure out how many rides Morgan can afford. 

**Here's how to solve for the number of friends:**

1. **Calculate the cost of mini-golf:**  $5 * number of friends
2. **Calculate the cost of go-karts:** $10 * number of rides
3. **Set up the equation:** $90 = ($5 * number of friends) + ($10 * number of rides)

"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy purchased, we need to consider the following:

* **Candy Cost:**  We know the candy costs $1.50 per pound.
* **Change:** Billy had $10.00 and spent a portion of this on candy. 
* **Gumballs:** Billy spent $0.20 on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.

**Let's break down the problem:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of the candy:**  We need to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought. 
2. **Calculate the amount of change:**  We can use the change to determine the number of pounds of candy. 

**To find the number of pounds of candy, we can use the following equation:**

* **Total Cost of Candy = Number of Pounds * Price per Pound**

**Let's solve for the number of pounds:**

* **Total Cost of Candy = $10.00 - $0.20 = $9.80**
* **Number of Pounds = $9.80 / $1.50 per pound = 6.53 pounds**


**Therefore, Billy bought approximately 6.53 pounds of candy.**

"The train's service interval is based on its total mileage traveled.  To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total mileage traveled per day and then divide that by the service interval.

* **Total mileage per day:** The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it makes 3 trips per day, so the total mileage per day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles.
* **Service interval:** The train requires service every 18,000 miles.

**Therefore, the number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.** 

**The train needs service every 27 days.**

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

For the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a total of 165 popsicles.  To determine the difference in popsicles between them, we can utilize the concept of proportions. 

Since the ratio is 5:6, we can express this as a fraction: 5/6.  This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

To find the number of popsicles Sam has, we can use the following equation:

Sam's popsicles = (6/11) * 165 popsicles

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Sam's popsicles = 90 popsicles

To find the difference in popsicles between Betty and Sam, we can subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:

Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15 popsicles.

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use the given information about the total number of heads and bumps. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' using either substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination:

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'c':**  c = 180 - d
2. **Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:** 2(180 - d) + d = 304
3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':** 360 - 2d + d = 304
                                          360 - d = 304
                                          -d = -56
                                          d = 56

"Kenny needs to sell enough Pokemon cards to cover the $100 amusement park ticket.  We know he's selling each card for $1.50.  To figure out how many cards he needs to sell, we can use the following equation:

* **Total Earnings = Price per Card * Number of Cards**

We know the total earnings need to be $100.  Let's represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.

* **1.5x = $100**

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.5:

* **x = $100 / 1.5**
* **x = 66.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Kenny started with approximately **67** cards.

* **Indras' name:**  Has 6 letters.
* **Sister's name:** Has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.  

To find the number of letters in the sister's name, we need to calculate half of Indras' name: 6 letters / 2 = 3 letters. Then, we add 4 to that number: 3 letters + 4 letters = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name is 6 + 7 = 13.

* **Solve for the width:** 360 = 9 * width, so width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.
* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width).  Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To determine the difference in beads between the sisters, we need to consider the number of beads each sister has. 

Elizabeth has 3 packs of clear beads and 1 pack of red beads, totaling 3 + 1 = 4 packs of beads.  

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, totaling 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.

The difference in the number of beads is calculated as follows:

Margareth's beads - Elizabeth's beads = 7 packs * 20 pieces/pack - 4 packs * 20 pieces/pack = 140 pieces - 80 pieces = 60 pieces.

Therefore, Margareth has 60 more beads than Elizabeth.

"The house's temperature increases by 900 degrees from the oven's heating.  After the window is opened, the temperature decreases by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes.  To find the final temperature, we need to calculate the temperature after the oven has been on for 3 hours. 

The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.  The temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, so the temperature increases by 5 degrees/hour * 180 minutes = 900 degrees. 

The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 30/10 = 3 degrees.  

The final temperature is 40 degrees + 900 degrees - 3 degrees = 937 degrees.

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost the same, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other. 

Let's break down the costs for each venue:

* **Venue 1:**  The flat fee is $200, and the cost per guest is $5.  
* **Venue 2:** The cost per guest is $25.

Setting the cost equations equal to each other, we get:

$200 + $5 * x = $25 * x

Where 'x' represents the number of guests.

Solving for 'x':

* $200 = $20 * x
* x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are needed for the two venues to have the same cost.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

Let's use the following variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36

Multiplying both sides by 2: 5x = 72

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects: (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found **14.2** insects.

"Suzie purchased four packs of gum in total.  She bought two packs of strawberry gum, which cost $2 each.  She also purchased a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the strawberry gum, which cost $1.  The total cost of the gum was $7.  

To find the cost of the strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = (Cost of strawberry gum) + (Cost of green apple gum)

We know the total cost is $7 and the cost of the green apple gum is $1.  We can solve for the cost of the strawberry gum by substituting the values into the equation:

$7 = (Cost of strawberry gum) + $1

Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation, we get:

$6 = (Cost of strawberry gum)

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  To find the total number of animals at the farm and zoo, we add the number of animals on each side: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals at the farm and zoo is 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up an equation:

* Rose's onions: 12
* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.  

To find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we can use the same logic:

* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 3
* Sophia's potatoes: 4 - 3 = 1

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of ratios.  Since Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad gets, we can express this as a ratio:

*  Jeff's share : Brad's share = 4 : 1

This means for every $1 Brad receives, Jeff receives $4.  

To find out how much Jeff receives, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount Brad receives.
*  Jeff receives 4x.

We know their total amount is $100.  Therefore:

*  x + 4x = $100

Combining like terms:

*  5x = $100

Solving for x:

*  x = $100 / 5
*  x = $20

Now, we can find Jeff's share:

*  Jeff receives 4x, so Jeff receives 4 * $20 = $80

"This is a classic example of a recursive sequence.  Each round of calls effectively doubles the number of families notified.  

To find the total number of families notified after the fourth round, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

* **a = 3** (initial number of families)
* **r = 3** (the common ratio for the number of families notified in each round)
* **n = 4** (number of rounds)

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is: S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)
S = 3 (1 - 81) / (-2)
S = 3 (-80) / (-2)
S = 120

Therefore, **120 families** will be notified after the fourth round of calls.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  

We know the jar contains a specific ratio of red, blue, and green jelly beans.  

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can represent the number of red jelly beans as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can represent the number of green jelly beans as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

To find the value of 'b', we divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

Now, let's calculate the difference in green and red jelly beans:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000 with an additional $500 for a porcelain crown.  His initial deposit is $600.  

To determine the total cost, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 x 2 = $4000.  The additional cost of the crown is $500.  Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the remaining amount he needs to pay.  He earns $15 per hour.  The amount he needs to earn is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

**Here's why:**

* **Tire Rotation and Mileage:**  The tire rotation rate is a key factor in determining tire lifespan.  
* **Tire Wear:**  The number of rotations is directly related to the amount of wear and tear on the tires. 
* **Tire Replacement:**  Tires are designed to have a certain number of rotations before they reach a point of wear and tear that necessitates replacement.

"To determine the cost per pump, we need to consider the total cost of the shampoo and the number of washings it provides.  The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings.  

Since each wash requires 1 pump, we can calculate the cost per pump by dividing the total cost by the number of pumps used. 

The cost per pump is $24.00 / 120 pumps = $0.20 per pump. 

To express this in cents, we multiply the cost per pump by 100.  Therefore, each pump costs 0.20 * 100 = 20 cents.

"Jim has a 20-pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

To calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to consider the gum he chews at school, the gum he chews on the way home and after dinner, and the gum he gives to his sister. 

* **Gum chewed at school:**  He chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

We know the following:

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to understand the relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns.  

The key is to recognize that the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is consistent.  

* **Understanding the Ratio:**  If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns is directly proportional to the number of potatoes. 

* **Calculating the Output:**  To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following:

   *  **Proportion:** 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns
   *  **Solving for x:** Cross-multiply and solve for x: 
      * 6 * x = 36 * 96
      * 6x = 3456
      * x = 3456 / 6
      * x = 576

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

The total cost of the crate is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00. 

**Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit is $32.00.**

"To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between the number of orange and white fish after Bob added new fish.  

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  Let's represent the number of white fish Bob bought as 'x'.  

Since the total number of fish after adding the new fish is 24, we can set up an equation:

* 3 + 17 = 20 
* 20 = 2 * x

Solving for x, we get:

* x = 20 / 2
* x = 10

Therefore, Bob bought **10** white fish at the store.

"Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the difference in earnings, we need to calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours and then subtract Sally's earnings for the same hours. 

* Billy's hourly rate after the first raise: $10.50
* Billy's hourly rate after his anniversary: $11.50
* Billy's earnings for 20 hours: 20 hours * $11.50/hour = $230.00
* Sally's starting salary: $10.50
* Sally's earnings for 20 hours: 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.00

Therefore, Billy's earnings are $230.00 and Sally's earnings are $210.00. The difference is $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00.

"Let's break down the recipe and figure out the oil amount.

* **Understanding the Ratios:**  The key here is recognizing the relationships between the ingredients. Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. This means we can simplify our calculations.

* **Setting up the Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    * Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    * Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    * Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Using the Given Information:**
    * We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    * We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    * We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    * We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    * We know she uses 10 ounces of the mixture.

* **Solving for the Amount of Oil (o):**
    * Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    * Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    * Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x
    * We know x = zest, so o = 4z

* **Finding the Amount of Oil (o):**
    * We know that Tanya uses 10 ounces of the mixture. 
    * We know that the mixture is made up of salt, oil, zest, fragrance, and sugar. 
    * We can use the information above to find the amount of oil (o).

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20.  To determine Joe's current car count, we can calculate:

* Joe's initial car count: 2 * 20 = 40 cars

After selling 20% of his cars, Joe has:

* Cars sold: 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars
* Cars remaining: 40 - 8 = 32 cars

Joe then gives away twice the number of cars he sold, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

* Cars remaining: 32 - 16 = 16 cars

Therefore, Joe remains with **16** cars.

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to work through the relationships between the three individuals' card collections. 

Let's break it down:

* **PJ's cards:**  We know that PJ has 'x' cards.
* **Smendrick's cards:** Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so he has 3x cards.
* **Becca's cards:** Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can express the total number of cards as a single equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

This means PJ has 47 cards.  

To find Becca's cards, we substitute the value of x back into the equation for Becca's cards:

"To determine the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we need to consider their badge earning rates. 

* **Claire:** Earning one badge per month.
* **Amber:** Earning half as many badges as Claire, so she earns 1/2 badge per month.
* **Wendy:** Earning three times the number of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns, which is 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month.

The difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber is calculated as follows:

Wendy's monthly badge earnings - Amber's monthly badge earnings = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 badges per month.

* **Total marbles = Initial marbles + Gift marbles**
* **Total marbles = 52 + 28 = 80**

* **Marbles lost = (1/4) * Total marbles**
* **Marbles lost = (1/4) * 80 = 20**

"To determine the cost of the chickens Isaias purchased, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens he intends to sell. 

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Profit Goal:** Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** He plans to sell each chicken for $50.
* **Number of Chickens:** He has 300 chickens in total.
* **Chickens to Sell:** He will sell 3/5 of his chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

**To calculate the cost of the chickens, we can use the following formula:**

* **Total Revenue = Number of Chickens Sold * Selling Price per Chicken**
* **Total Revenue = 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000**

**The profit is calculated as:**

* **Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Chickens**

**To find the cost of the chickens, we can rearrange the formula:**

* **Cost of Chickens = Total Revenue - Profit**
* **Cost of Chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000**


**Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.**

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

* **Total boxes used:** 3 blue boxes + 3 red boxes = 6 boxes.
* **Red and blue boxes remaining:** 9 red boxes - 3 red boxes = 6 red boxes.
* **Blue boxes remaining:** 7 blue boxes - 3 blue boxes = 4 blue boxes.
* **Total remaining:** 6 red boxes + 4 blue boxes = 10 boxes.

Therefore, Tim has **10** red and blue shoe boxes remaining.

"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we can use the information given:

* Benny used 40 pieces of bologna for the red balloons.
* The total number of bologna used was 58.
* We know that 20 of the balloons were red.

Therefore, we can calculate the number of yellow balloons by subtracting the number of red balloons from the total number of balloons:

* Total number of balloons = 20 (red) + x (yellow)
* 58 (total bologna) = 20 (red) * 2 + x (yellow) * 3
* 58 = 40 + 3x
* 18 = 3x
* x = 6

Therefore, there are **6** yellow balloons in the bundle.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John.  To find Peter's age, we need to use a system of equations.

* Let's represent Peter's age as ""P""
* Paul's age is ""P + 10""
* John's age is ""J""

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

We can simplify this equation to:

2P + J = 100

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so:

P = (P + 10) + J

Now we can solve for J in the second equation:

J = P - (P + 10)
J = -10

This is a problem!  We can't have a negative age.  This means there's an error in the problem statement.  It's impossible for the ages to add up to 100 with the given information.

"Deanna is 26 years old.  Marcus is half of Leo's age, and Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna.  To find Leo's age, we can use the following equation:

* Marcus's age = Deanna's age / 2
* Marcus's age = 26 / 2 = 13 years old
* Since Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, we can find Leo's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age: 
* Leo's age = Deanna's age - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 21 years old.

* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A = B - 20
* A = (D + 10) - 20
* A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35 / 3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"Let's break down the problem to find out how many Pokemon Stan caught.

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

To solve for Stan's catch, we need to find the value of W (Adelwolfe's catch).  We can do this by substituting the first two equations into the third equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339
2S + W = 339

Now, substitute the second equation into this equation:
2(4W - 13) + W = 339
8W - 26 + W = 339
9W - 26 = 339
9W = 365
W = 40.56

Since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon, we'll round this to 41.

Now, we can find Stan's catch by substituting the value of W back into the second equation:
S = 4(41) - 13
S = 164 - 13
S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let Emil's current age be represented by 'e' and his father's age be represented by 'f'.  We know the following:

*  e = 19 (Emil's current age)
*  f = 2 * e (Emil's father will be twice Emil's age when he turns 24)
*  e + 24 = 1/2 * f (Emil will be half his father's age when he turns 24)

Let's solve for 'e' and 'f':

1.  Substitute the value of 'e' from the first equation into the third equation: 19 + 24 = 1/2 * f
2.  Simplify: 43 = 1/2 * f
3.  Solve for 'f': f = 43 * 2 = 86
4.  Substitute the value of 'f' into the second equation: f = 2 * e

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**

"Marcus has a 80% chance of needing to turn in his homework tomorrow.  Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%
* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

 
**Therefore, the probability of Marcus needing to turn in his homework is 80%.**

"Let's break down this fencing problem.  

We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Harry has.

* **Let's represent Sam's fencing as 'x' feet.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet.**

The total length of fencing is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

This means Sam has 20 feet of fencing.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fencing from the total:

* 100 - 80 = 20

**Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing left over.**

"The fastest car ever made is a topic of much discussion in the automotive world.  To determine its top speed, we need to consider the relative performance of different vehicles. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is a common benchmark for performance.  

The average car's speed is 120 mph.  Therefore, the 2nd fastest car is 120 * 5 = 600 mph.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, which is 600 mph.  Therefore, the fastest car's speed is 600 * 1.25 = 750 mph.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  This means we can represent their individual egg counts as 'x' and 'x' respectively.
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent Sarah's eggs as 'y' and Camden's eggs as 'y + 12'.
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56, so we can set up an equation: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**Solving for 'y' (Sarah's eggs):**

*  We know that 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  We can substitute the value of 'x' from the first equation (2x + 2y + 12 = 56) into this equation. 
*  This will give us an equation with only 'y' as a variable.

**Solving for 'x' (Arnold and Madeline's eggs):**

*  We can use the equation 2x + 2y + 12 = 56 to solve for 'x'. 
*  We can then substitute the value of 'y' we found in the previous step.

**Finding the Difference:**

*  Once we have the values for 'x' and 'y', we can find the difference between Camden's eggs and Arnold's eggs.

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons and boxes:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To express this in pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound: 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We can represent this information with the following equations:

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can set up an equation to solve for the length of the yellow rope:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
6x - 35 = 37
6x = 72
x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  To find the length of the red rope, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation for the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Colin is currently 12.5 years old. 

**Explanation:**

We can solve this problem using a system of equations. Let's represent Colin's current age as 'C' and Wendy's current age as 'W'.  

* **Equation 1:** W = 5(C + 7)  
* **Equation 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

We can substitute the value of W from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

Simplifying and solving for C:

* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
* C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
* C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
* C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
* (2/3)C = -5
* C = -5 * (3/2)
* C = -15/2

Since age cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach.  Let's revisit the initial equations and see if we can find a different solution.

"John's scotch purchase represents a standard cost analysis.  To determine the total cost of his cognac purchase, we need to consider the price per bottle and the quantity. 

* **Cost per bottle of cognac:**  The cognac is priced 50% higher than the scotch, meaning it costs $1.50 per bottle.

* **Quantity of cognac:**  John purchased twice the number of bottles of scotch, so he bought 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

* **Total cost of cognac:**  The total cost of the cognac is 20 bottles * $1.50/bottle = $300.

* **Total cost of both items:**  The total cost of both items is $600 (scotch) + $300 (cognac) = $900.

Here's how to calculate that:

* **Selling Price:** Trinity sells each magazine for 11/8 of the original price, which is $72 * (11/8) = $99.
* **Profit:**  Her profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, so her profit is $99 - $72 = $27.

"The dehumidifier's performance can be analyzed by understanding the relationship between the settings and their water removal rates. 

* **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
* **Medium setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 liter * 2 = 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** Removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters * 2 = 4 liters per day.

To calculate the total water removed, we need to consider the time spent on each setting:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters** 


Therefore, the total water removed by the dehumidifier is 30 liters.

"Pauline's annual museum visits have experienced a price increase.  Let's break down the cost calculation:

* **Initial Cost:**  The museum's admission fee is $2 per visit.
* **Price Increase:** The cost has increased by 150%, which translates to an additional $3 per visit.
* **New Cost:** The new cost per visit is $2 + $3 = $5.

Over a 5-year period, Pauline visits the museum 15 times.  The total cost for these visits is 15 visits * $5/visit = $75.

For the next 3 years, Pauline continues her visits, totaling 9 visits.  The cost for these visits is 9 visits * $5/visit = $45.

Therefore, the total cost for Pauline's museum visits over the entire 8-year period is $75 + $45 = $120.

"The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  To find the length of the longer piece, we need to know the length of the shorter piece.  

Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Carly needs to make enough treats for her art class, which has 5 students.  Each student gets 2 treats.  To figure out how many cupcakes she needs to make, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies.

We know that:

*  b = 3c - 2 
*  The total number of treats is 10.

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

*  b + c = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

*  (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

*  4c - 2 = 10
*  4c = 12
*  c = 3

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To determine the number of novels she has written this year, we can use the concept of proportions.  Since 3/4 of her novels this year represent the 9 novels she wrote last year, we can set up a proportion:

*  (3/4) * x = 9 

Where 'x' represents the number of novels Regina wrote this year.

Solving for 'x':

* x = 9 * (4/3)
* x = 12 novels

Therefore, Regina has written **12** novels this year.

* **Pasta cost:**  $1.00 per box
* **Cheddar cheese:** $3.00 per box
* **Gruyere cheese:** $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 per box
* **Total cheese cost:** $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

To determine the annual cost, we need to consider the number of weeks in a year. 

* **Weekly cost:** $9.00
* **Yearly cost:** $9.00 * 52 weeks = $468.00

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 on making macaroni and cheese in a year.

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between strawberry and blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  Therefore:

* x + (5x - 4) = 116

Simplifying the equation:

* 6x - 4 = 116

Solving for x:

* 6x = 120
* x = 20

This means Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.  

The number of blueberry cubes is then:

* 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

Therefore, Mary made **96** blueberry cubes.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his speaking speed and the word count per page. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **John's speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)
* **John's new speed:** 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM
* **Words per page:** 450 words
* **Total words:** 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it takes him to speak the total words:

"Tim needs 7 lemons. Here's how to figure that out:

* **Calculate total juice needed:**  He wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. So, he needs 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.
* **Calculate lemons for the extra gallon:**  He wants to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart as the other gallons.  This means he needs 4 cups * 2 = 8 cups of juice.
* **Calculate lemons for the extra gallon:**  To get 8 cups of juice, he needs 8 cups / 6 lemons/cup = 1.33 lemons. Since you can't have a fraction of a lemon, he needs to buy 1 more lemon.
* **Total lemons:** 1 lemon + 6 lemons = 7 lemons.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

Emma's age = x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"The quilt will be made from 11 small t-shirts (3 square feet each), 8 medium t-shirts (4 square feet each), and 6 large t-shirts (6 square feet each).  

To calculate the total square footage, we need to consider the area of each shirt type and then add them together.

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Adding these together: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet. 

Therefore, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, meaning it has 36 seeds + (36 seeds * 0.50) = 54 seeds.  Therefore, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.  The total number of seeds is 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds. 

**Answer:** 90

"To figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to consider his total funds after completing his chores and buying ice cream. 

* **Chore Earnings:** Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores, and he completed chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.
* **Ice Cream Cost:**  He spent $1.25 per ice cream cone and bought 3 cones for himself and 3 friends, so the total cost is $1.25 * 3 = $3.75.
* **Total Funds:**  After his chores and ice cream, Ryan has $18 + $3.75 = $21.75.
* **Movie Tickets:**  Tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.3 tickets.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. 

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
