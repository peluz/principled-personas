"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen.  

Since the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162.

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can use a simple algebraic equation.  Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is represented as 110.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

To determine the total cost, we first need to consider the number of guests who will receive gift bags.  Since 1/4 of the attendees are expected to be absent, we can calculate the number of guests who will be present: 16 guests * (1 - 1/4) = 12 guests.

The cost of the gift bags is $2 each, and Christina needs 9 gift bags to accommodate the 12 guests.  Therefore, the total cost is 9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18.00.

"Gerald's improved speed is a function of his training regimen and nutrition.  We can model this with a simple linear equation.  Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x' seconds.  Lee's time is then 'x + 2' seconds.  

We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

This means Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.  To calculate Gerald's new time with his improved diet, we can use the following formula:

Gerald's new time = x + 0.1x

Substituting the value of x, we get:

Gerald's new time = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We can calculate his current salary by adding 40% to his previous salary: $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

* Lylah's salary four years ago was calculated by knowing that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than hers.  We can use this information to find Lylah's salary. 

* To find Lylah's salary four years ago, we can use the following equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30. 
* Solving for Lylah's salary, we get: $40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30. 
* Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).

* Now, we can calculate Lylah's salary four years later by adding 40% to her previous salary: $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

* Finally, to find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we add their current salaries: $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"The hive's population dynamics can be analyzed through a simple bee-centric model.  

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is a fundamental factor in determining the hive's overall population.  
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are directly proportional to the number of queens.  
* **Baby Bees:** Baby bees (b) are a direct result of the queen's reproductive output.

Therefore, we can express the relationship between these bee types as follows:

* **w = 2b**  (The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees)
* **b = 2q**  (The number of baby bees is twice the number of queens)

To determine the number of worker bees, we can substitute the value of 'b' from the second equation into the first equation:

* **w = 2 * (2q)** 
* **w = 4q**

We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700.  Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of queens:

* **q + 2q + 4q = 700**
* **7q = 700**
* **q = 100**

Now, we can substitute the value of 'q' back into the equation for worker bees:

* **w = 4q**
* **w = 4 * 100**
* **w = 400**

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We are given that Seth's age is twice Brooke's age. This can be represented as: S = 2B
* In two years, their ages will sum to 28. This can be represented as: S + B + 2 = 28

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = 2B, we can substitute this into the second equation: 2B + B + 2 = 28
2. **Simplify:** Combine the B terms: 3B + 2 = 28
3. **Isolate B:** Subtract 2 from both sides: 3B = 26
4. **Solve for B:** Divide both sides by 3: B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* S = 2B, so S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"To determine the cost of lemons, we need to consider the profit margin and the revenue generated per gallon.  

* **Profit:** $25
* **Revenue per gallon:** $10 (calculated by multiplying the price per glass by the number of glasses sold per gallon)
* **Cost per gallon:** $5 (calculated by adding the cost of lemons and sugar)

We can determine the number of gallons sold by dividing the total profit by the revenue per gallon:

* **Gallons sold:** $25 / $10 = 2.5 gallons

The total cost of lemons is then calculated by multiplying the number of gallons sold by the cost per gallon:

* **Cost of lemons:** 2.5 gallons * $5/gallon = $12.50

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw distributed to the rodents.  

* **Hamsters:**  The 10 hamster cages each have 5 pieces of straw, totaling 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** The 160 pieces of straw used are distributed among the rodents, with 110 pieces used for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We can calculate the number of rats by dividing the total straw used for rats by the number of pieces of straw each rat receives: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.
* **Rat Per Cage:**  To find the number of rats per cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The trader's profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost of the wheat from the total revenue generated from selling the wheat.  

* **Total cost:** The cost of the wheat is determined by the purchase price per bag ($20) multiplied by the number of bags purchased (x). 
* **Total revenue:** The revenue is calculated by multiplying the selling price per bag ($30) by the number of bags sold (x).

The trader's profit is $400, which is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. 

To find the number of bags sold, we can set up an equation:

**Profit = Revenue - Cost**

**400 = 30x - 20x**

Solving for x:

**400 = 10x**

**x = 40**

Therefore, the trader sold **40** bags.

"The cost of a dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of half a dozen plates:**  Each plate costs $6000, and a dozen is 12, so the cost is $6000 * 6 = $36000.
* **Cost of twenty dozen cups:**  The cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.
* **Cost per cup:**  To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $34800 / 240 = $145.

**Therefore, the cost of buying each cup is $145.**

"The problem presents a classic scenario in poultry management.  Let's break it down:

* **Egg Production:**  We know the red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day.  
* **Total Eggs:**  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total. 
* **Chicken Ratio:**  The problem states there are two more white chickens than red chickens.

To solve this, we need to find a way to express the number of red chickens in terms of the number of white chickens.  

**Let's use the following equation:**

* **Total Eggs = (Red Chickens * Eggs per Red Chicken) + (White Chickens * Eggs per White Chicken)**

**Let's plug in the known values:**

* 42 = (r * 3) + (w * 5)

**We also know:**

* **r = w + 2**

**Now, we can solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

1. Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   42 = (w + 2 * 3) + (w * 5)
2. Simplify and solve for 'w':
   42 = (w + 6) + (5w)
   42 = 6w + 6
   36 = 6w
   w = 6

**Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation r = w + 2 to find 'r':**

* r = 6 + 2
* r = 8

**Therefore, Jerry has 8 red chickens.**

* **Current Water Levels:** The problem states the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This implies a current state of the water levels.

The problem is inconsistent.  The initial state of the pools is not consistent with the current state. 

**Therefore, the problem cannot be solved as presented.**

"To determine the average age of the three individuals in three years, we need to consider their current ages and the impact of aging. 

* **Harriet's Age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's Age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's Age:**  Zack is half of Harriet's age, making him 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

**Calculating the Average:**

In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old. Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old. Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old.

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5 years.

"To determine the probability of a randomly selected card being a water type, we need to consider the current composition of James's collection. 

* **Total Pokemon:** James possesses 30 (Fire) + 20 (Grass) + 40 (Water) = 90 Pokemon.
* **Water Pokemon:** After losing 8 water type Pokemon, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type Pokemon remaining.

The probability of selecting a water type card is then calculated as:

**Probability = (Number of Water Pokemon) / (Total Pokemon)**

**Probability = 32 / 90**

This simplifies to approximately 0.356.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is **36%**.

* **Stage 2: Subsequent Harvest:** Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.

* **Stage 3:  Unripe Watermelons:**  To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we must subtract the number of watermelons harvested from the initial number of watermelons. 

Therefore, the number of watermelons not ready for harvest is 120 - 36 - 63 = **21**.

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving a direct relationship between the number of snails and fish.  Let's break it down:

* **Snail Discrepancy:** The difference in snail populations (32 - 4 = 28) is directly proportional to the number of fish. 
* **Proportionality:**  This relationship can be expressed mathematically as: 28 = 2 * x, where 'x' represents the number of fish.
* **Solving for x:**  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 14.

Therefore, each aquarium contains 14 fish.

"The weight of a single redwood section is 400 pounds.  To determine the total weight of the redwood, we need to consider the height of the tree and the weight of each section.  

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each section weighs 400 pounds.  Therefore, the total weight of the redwood is:

* 200 feet * 10 feet/section * 400 pounds/section = 80,000 pounds

Termites consume a portion of the wood, and the weight of the wood eaten is 30% of the total weight.  

The weight of the wood eaten is 80,000 pounds * 0.30 = 24,000 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood is 80,000 pounds - 24,000 pounds = 56,000 pounds.

"The time required to dig the holes can be calculated by considering the time per hole for each type of hole. 

* **Small holes:** 3 minutes per hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes
* **Large holes:** 10 minutes per hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

The total time for all the holes is 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total time in minutes by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours. 

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to understand the relationship between the number of cobras and mambas.  

* **Cobra Spot Count:**  A cobra has 70 spots.
* **Mamba Spot Count:** A mamba has 35 spots.

The total number of spots for all snakes in the park is calculated by adding the number of spots for each snake type.

* **Total Spots:** 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra + 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

* **Half the Total Spots:** 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

"To transport 80 flagstones, we need to determine the number of trucks required to carry the total weight.  

Each truck has a capacity of 2000 pounds.  

First, calculate the total weight of the flagstones: 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 5,000 pounds.

Next, divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck: 5,000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks.

Since we cannot have half a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 3 trucks are required.

"The car in the fast lane traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.  To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can utilize the relationship between distance, speed, and time.

The formula is:  *distance = speed * time*

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the car in the slow lane is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.

Therefore, 480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"To determine the total number of medals given out for counting, we need to consider the relationship between Ali and Izzy's medals and the total medals awarded. 

Let 'x' represent the total number of medals given out.  We know:

* Ali and Izzy have 39 medals combined.
* This is equal to 39 = x - (Ali's medals + Izzy's medals)

We can substitute the known values:

* 39 = x - (22 + 17)

Simplifying the equation:

* 39 = x - 39

Solving for x:

* x = 39 + 39
* x = 78

Therefore, **78** medals have been given out for counting.

"Theo's business trip to South Africa requires careful financial planning.  

Let's analyze his expenses:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight:** The flight cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, which is $500.  Therefore, the flight cost is $500 + $700 = $1200.
* **Total Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

He has $6000 to spend, leaving him with $6000 - $2350 = $3650.

To determine how much he can spend on gifts, we need to subtract his expenses from his remaining funds: $3650 - $2000 = $1650.

"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can use a strategic approach.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Total Players:** The team has 105 members in total.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense.

We can represent this with the following equation:

*  x (defense) + 2x (offense) + (x/2) (special teams) = 105

Simplifying the equation:

* 3x + (x/2) = 105

Combining like terms:

* (7/2)x = 105

Solving for x:

* x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

"To determine the number of boxes required to store all the pencils, we need to consider the number of pencils each individual possesses. 

Jam has 24 pencils, and we know that each box holds 12 pencils.  Therefore, Jam requires 24 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 2 boxes. 

Meg has 46 pencils.  To determine the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box: 46 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 3.83.  Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round this number up to 4 boxes.

Therefore, a total of 2 boxes for Jam and 4 boxes for Meg is required to store all the pencils.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in record trading.  Let's break it down:

* **Record Exchange Ratio:** The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1. This means for every 2 old records traded, 1 new record is obtained.

* **Total Records Traded:**  The 5 individuals traded a total of 5 * x records, where 'x' represents the number of old records each person brought.

* **New Records:** The total number of new records obtained is 7.

* **Solving for 'x':**  We can express the total number of new records as 5x = 7.

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate.  Let's analyze the two scenarios:

**Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $30,000
* **Tax:** $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $24,000

**Job B:**

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having an equal number of students.  The remaining group is 10 students less than each of the other two groups.  To determine the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for 'x':** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200
   * 3x = 210
   * x = 70

* **Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.**

"The train's operational requirements are straightforward.  To determine the service interval, we need to consider the total distance traveled per day.  

The train travels 225 miles per trip, and it makes three trips per day.  Therefore, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles.

The service interval is 18,000 miles.  To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval: 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train requires service every **27 days**.

"Erin's current score of 14 points represents a 3:1 ratio to Sara's 8 points.  To determine Erin's score before the current game, we can utilize the concept of ratios.  

Since Erin's score is three times greater than Sara's, we can express this as a ratio: 14:8.  To find Erin's score before the current game, we can use the following equation:

"Millie's lemonade stand is a classic example of a simple business model.  To maximize profit, we need to analyze her cost structure and revenue generation. 

**Cost Analysis:**

* **Supplies:** Millie's initial investment of $18 covers the cost of ingredients and packaging. This is a fixed cost, meaning it remains constant regardless of the number of cups sold.

**Revenue Analysis:**

* **Pricing:**  Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1. This is a standard pricing strategy, ensuring a consistent revenue stream.
* **Sales Volume:**  She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, indicating a steady demand for her product.

**Profit Calculation:**

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to consider her revenue and cost. 

* **Revenue:**  Millie sells 144 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup, resulting in $144.
* **Cost:**  Her initial investment of $18 covers the cost of supplies.

**Profit:**  Millie's profit per hour is calculated as follows:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $144 - $18 = $126

**Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is $126.**

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a 11-part ratio.  To determine the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we can calculate the difference in popsicles based on the ratio. 

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we can find the value of one ratio part by dividing the total popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts of the ratio, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.  Sam has 6 parts of the ratio, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.  The difference between Sam's popsicles and Betty's popsicles is 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel's energy consumption can be analyzed by understanding the power consumption of his air conditioner.  

The AC operates at a power of 900 watts, and he uses it for 8 hours daily. This translates to a daily energy consumption of 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours. 

If Mel reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, his daily energy consumption drops to 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

The energy saved daily is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

To express this in kilowatt-hours, we divide by 1000: 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours. 


**Final answer: 135 kWh**

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'd' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"To determine the initial number of Pokemon cards Kenny possessed, we need to consider the revenue generated from card sales and his available cash. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Revenue:** Kenny aims to earn $100 to cover the amusement park ticket.
* **Selling Price:** Each card is priced at $1.50.
* **Profit:**  The profit is the revenue generated from card sales.

We can express this mathematically as:

* **Profit = Number of Cards * Selling Price**

We know the profit must be equal to the cost of the ticket, which is $100.  

* **Equation:** 1.5x = 100 
* **Solving for x:**  Divide both sides by 1.5 to find the number of cards (x): x = 100 / 1.5 = 66.67

Since we need a whole number of cards, we round this value to the nearest whole number. 

**Answer:** Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

"The problem presents a classic example of a proportion.  We know that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers, and 20 students do not.  This means that 1/4 of the students have desktop computers.  

To find the total number of students, we can set up a proportion:

*  (3/4) * x = 1/4 * (total students)

Solving for x, we get:

*  x = (1/4) * (total students) * (4/3)
*  x = (1/3) * (total students)

We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers.  This means that 1/4 of the students have desktop computers.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

*  (1/4) * (total students) = 20

Solving for the total number of students, we get:

*  (total students) = 20 * 4
*  (total students) = 80

**Answer:** 80

"To determine the number of guests for cost equivalence, we need to analyze the cost structure of each venue. 

Venue 1:  A flat fee of $200 is charged regardless of the number of guests.  However, the cost of food is an additional $5 per guest.

Venue 2:  The cost is directly proportional to the number of guests, with a fixed price of $25 per guest.

For the two venues to be cost-equivalent, the cost of Venue 1 must equal the cost of Venue 2.  

Let's set up an equation to represent this:

$200 + $5 * x = $25 * x

Where 'x' represents the number of guests.

Solving for 'x':

$200 = $20 * x

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be cost-equivalent. 


**Answer:** 10

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we can break down the problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Solving for x:
* Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
* Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects:
* Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, so the couch is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet long. 

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the quantities they purchased.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4x onions.

We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can write the proportion: 
 
 4x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, we can find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.  

*  Rose bought 4 potatoes.
*  Sophia bought 3 onions.

We can use the relationship between the quantities they purchased to find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'y' represent the number of potatoes Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4y potatoes.

We know Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can write the proportion:

4y = 4

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4 / 4 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 1 potato.

Finally, to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought:

3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes.

"To determine the nephew's age, we can use a simple linear equation.  

Let 'x' represent the nephew's current age.  In seven years, he will be x + 7 years old.  

We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This is because Shiloh's age in seven years will be three times the nephew's age in seven years.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3(x + 7) = 51

Solving for x:

1. 3x + 21 = 51
2. 3x = 30
3. x = 10

Therefore, the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The key to this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the jelly bean quantities.  Let's break it down:

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we can express this as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:**  We know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we can express this as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains **15** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

* **Age in Three Years = Current Age + 3**

Let's calculate Jerry's current age:

* **Age Five Years Ago = Current Age - 5**
* **Age in Three Years = Current Age + 3**

We know that Jerry's current age is 10 years old.  Therefore, his age five years ago was 10 - 5 = 5 years old.

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 per implant * 2 implants = $4000. The additional cost of the crown is $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the total cost of the dental work. His hourly wage is $15 per hour.  Therefore, the number of hours he needs to work is $4500 / $15 per hour = 300 hours.

"The angles in a triangle must always add up to 180 degrees.  Let's represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms: 6x = 180

Solving for x: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  The problem states that Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours at school.  He is at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:**  He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:**  Jim gives his sister half of his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  Therefore: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This can be expressed as s + g = 20

Solving for 's' in Equation 2, we get: s = 20 - g.

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1: 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70.

Simplify and solve for 'g': 80 - 4g + 2g = 70  =>  -2g = -10  =>  g = 5.

Substitute the value of 'g' back into the equation s = 20 - g to find 's': s = 20 - 5 => s = 15.

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Based on the established relationship between potatoes and hash browns, we can determine the number of hash browns produced from 96 potatoes.  

The key is to understand the proportionality of the relationship.  Since 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can deduce that the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. 

To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6x = 36 * 96
* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"The price of the crate of fruit can be determined by considering the cost of each fruit type.

"Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students.  To determine the total number of shirts needed, we can break down the student sizes:

* **Extra-small:** 11 students
* **Small:** Twice the number of extra-small students is 11 * 2 = 22 students.
* **Medium:** Four less than the number of size small students is 22 - 4 = 18 students.
* **Large:** Half the number of size medium students is 18 / 2 = 9 students.
* **Extra-large:** Six more than the size large students is 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Adding the number of students for each size, we get 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 students.

"Based on the given information, we can determine the total number of puppies Jana has.  Since two-thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians, and we know one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can deduce that the total number of puppies is directly proportional to the number of Pomeranians. 

Therefore, if we know the number of Pomeranian girls, we can calculate the total number of puppies. 

The number of Pomeranian girls is 6, and we know that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls.  Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18. 

Since two-thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, the total number of puppies is 18 * (2/3) = 12.

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Ratios:**  The problem states that Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. This means the ratios of these ingredients are equal.

2. **Utilizing the Information:** We know the following:
    *  x = zest
    *  y = salt = z
    *  o = oil = 2y

"To determine Becca's card count, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the number of cards PJ has as 'x'.  Smendrick has 3 times this amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical trend.  We can analyze this by breaking down his production over the first three weeks:

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars

To determine the production for week 4, we need to consider the total production for the first three weeks.  

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find the production for week 4, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** 14,000 bars.

"The installation cost for Angela's project is calculated as follows:

* **Mirrors:**  Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation is $529.00.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We can determine this by analyzing the relationship between the individuals' lifting abilities and the mountain's height.

* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. This means Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches. This means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches. This means Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"The time it takes for four turtles to traverse the same distance is directly proportional to the number of turtles and inversely proportional to the speed of each turtle.  

Since the distance is constant, we can use the following relationship:

* **Time = Distance / Speed**

Let's break down the problem:

* **Kangaroos:**  Each kangaroo travels at a speed of 'x' and takes 18 hours to cover the distance.
* **Turtles:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is 'x/2'.

To find the time for four turtles, we can use the following:

* **Time (turtles) = (Distance) / (Speed per turtle)**
* **turtles = 18 hours * (4 turtles) / (x/2)**
* **turtles = 36 hours**


Therefore, it will take **36 hours** for four turtles to travel the same distance.

"To determine the number of books Fawn possesses, we can employ a systematic approach.  

Let's represent Fawn's book collection as ""F"".  We know that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, and Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.  

* **Anne's books:** F - 12
* **Sofie's books:** F - 12 + 25

The total number of books is the sum of these three: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Combining like terms, we get: 3F + 13 = 85

Subtracting 13 from both sides: 3F = 72

Finally, dividing both sides by 3: F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

"To determine the initial cost of the chickens, we need to consider the profit margin and the number of chickens sold. 

* **Profit:** Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
* **Selling Price:** Each chicken is sold for $50.
* **Number of Chickens Sold:** Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

To calculate the total revenue, we multiply the number of chickens sold by the selling price: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Subtracting the profit from the total revenue, we can determine the initial cost: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias must have purchased the chickens for $7000.

* Melanie's age in 'x' years: 8 + x
* Her age will be thrice her present age: 8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for 'x':

* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"To determine Peter's age, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:

* Peter's age: P
* Paul's age: P + 10
* Jean's age: J

We know the following:

* P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
* P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Solving for J in the second equation:

* J = 100 - 2P

Substituting this value of J into the first equation:

* P + P + (100 - 2P) = 100

Simplifying the equation:

* 2P + 100 - 2P = 100
* 100 = 100

This equation is true, meaning the given information is consistent. 

Therefore, we can conclude that Peter's age is 36.67 years old.

"To determine Azibo's score, we can use the given information and the principles of algebraic modeling. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to eliminate B:

(A + D + (A + 20)) = 45
2A + D + 20 = 45
2A + D = 25

We can now solve for D in terms of A:

D = 25 - 2A

We can substitute this value of D back into the equation B = D + 10:

B = (25 - 2A) + 10
B = 35 - 2A

We can substitute this value of B into the equation B = A + 20:

A + 20 = 35 - 2A
3A = 15
A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored **5 points**.

"The problem presents a classic scenario in cooperative game theory.  We can solve this by understanding the concept of ""fair division.""  

Let's break it down:

* **Individual Shares:**  Amora and Lainey receive 70 chips each, totaling 70 + 70 = 140 chips.
* **The ""Extra"" Share:**  The remaining chips are distributed to the other two individuals.  
* **The Key:**  The key to solving this is to understand that the ""extra"" share is a function of the total number of chips. 

**Therefore, the total number of chips is 140 + 125 = 265.**

"The cost of travel is calculated by adding 50% to the cost of supplies.  Therefore, the cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies.  

The total cost of the trip is $400, which is the sum of the cost of supplies and the cost of travel.  

Let 'x' represent the cost of travel.  We can set up the following equation:

400 = x + 1.50x

Combining like terms, we get:

400 = 2.50x

Solving for x, we find:

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three legs: a southward flight, a northward flight, and a final southward flight.  

* **Southward Flight:** The bird travels 300 miles south at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 10 hours. 
* **Northward Flight:** The bird then flies 36 miles north at a speed of 18 miles per hour for 2 hours.
* **Southward Flight:** Finally, the bird flies 110 miles south at a speed of 22 miles per hour for 5 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances of each leg. 

**Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles**

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.

"To determine the sum of Emil's father and brother's ages, we can use a system of equations.  Let Emil's father's current age be represented by 'f' and his brother's age by 'b'.  

We know the following:

*  f = 24 * 2 = 48 years (Emil's father will be twice as old as his brother when Emil turns 24)
*  f = 1/2 * (24 + 48) (Emil will be half the age of his father when he turns 24)

Solving for 'f' and 'b' we get:

* f = 48 years
* b = 12 years

The sum of their ages is:

* f + b = 48 + 12 = 60 years

Therefore, the sum of their ages is 60.

To calculate the time to recoup his losses, we need to determine how many years it takes to earn $300,000. 

**Time to recoup:**  To earn $300,000, it would take Jim 300,000 / 50,000 = 6 years.

"To determine the fabric requirements for Jim's comforter, we need to consider the dimensions of the bed and the desired dimensions of the fabric. 

The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To ensure a proper fit, the fabric pieces should be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  

Therefore, the fabric pieces will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

The area of the bed is calculated as 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.

Each fabric piece will have an area of 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

To determine the total fabric needed, we multiply the area of each piece by the number of pieces: 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

**Answer:** 160 square feet

"The problem can be solved by considering the relationship between the number of balls retrieved in each set.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set. 

*  The first set is represented by 'x + 4'.

*  The third set is represented by 'x/2'.

*  The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of these three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

*  Solving for 'x', we get: 
    * 5x/2 + 4 = 19
    * 5x/2 = 15
    * x = 6

*  Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. 

*  The first set is represented by x + 4, so Rory retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  To calculate the value in 2010, we need to consider the depreciation rate and the initial value.  

The depreciation rate is 21% per year.  

The value in 2010 is calculated as follows:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"To determine the amount of fence remaining for Sam, we need to first determine the total length of fence allocated to Harry.  

Let's represent Sam's fence length as 'x' and Harry's as 'x + 60'.  The total fence length is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms: 
2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find the amount left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence length from the total fence length:

100 - 80 = 20

"Let's break down the problem using a systematic approach.

* **Let's represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline with 'x'.**  This is a standard approach in such scenarios.
* **We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.** This is a fundamental principle in this type of problem.
* **We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.** This is a key piece of information.
* **We can use this information to create equations.** 

**Let's use the information to solve for the unknowns:**

* **Equation 1:** x + x = 2x (This represents the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline)
* **Equation 2:** y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12 (This represents the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah)
* **Equation 3:** 2x + (2y + 12) = 56 (This represents the total number of eggs painted by all four individuals)

**Solving for 'y' (the number of eggs Sarah painted):**

* **Equation 2:** 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* **Equation 2:** 2y = 44 - 2x
* **Equation 2:** y = 22 - x

**Solving for 'x' (the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted):**

* **Equation 1:** x + x = 2x
* **Equation 1:** 2x = 56
* **Equation 1:** x = 28

**Solving for 'Camden's' eggs:**

* **Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12**
* **Camden painted 22 - 28 + 12 = 26 eggs**

"The avocado tree's fruit production follows a clear pattern:

* **Year 1-5:**  The tree exhibits a consistent production rate of 50 fruits per year.
* **Year 6-8:**  The production increases by a factor of 3, then 7, and then 200 less than the 10-year-old tree. 
* **Year 9:**  The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:** The tree produces 20 times the initial production.

To calculate the total fruit production, we can break down the production for each year and sum the results. 

**Total Fruit Production:**

* Year 1-5: 50 fruits/year * 5 years = 250 fruits
* Year 6: 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits
* Year 7: 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits
* Year 8: 350 fruits - 200 fruits = 150 fruits
* Year 9: 0 fruits
* Year 10: 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits

**Total: 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits**

"The problem presents a classic linear equation scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.
    *  The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' cm long.
    *  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(y - 7)' cm long.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm, so:
    y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve the equation:**
    1. y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
    2. 6y - 35 = 37
    3. 6y = 72
    4. y = 12

* **Determine the length of the red rope:**
    The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so:
    Red rope length = 4(y - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 cm.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Amounts:** Ronnie had $5, and Rissa had 3 * $5 = $15.
* **Giving to Sister:**  Both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount, which we'll call 'x'.  
* **Rissa's Remaining Balance:**  After giving 'x', Rissa had 1/5 * $15 = $3 left.
* **Ronnie's Remaining Balance:**  Ronnie also gave 'x' to her sister, leaving her with $5 - x.

**The Key Insight:**  The problem states that Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. This means that the amount she gave away represents 1/5 of her initial amount. 

**Solving for x:**

* We know that Rissa gave away $3, and this represents 1/5 of her initial amount. 
* Therefore, we can set up the equation: $3 = (1/5) * $15 
* Solving for x, we get: $3 = $3.

"The mural's color distribution is crucial for a balanced aesthetic.  Since the yellow paint represents half the mural, we can deduce that the red and purple paints each represent 1/4 of the mural.  Therefore, the total amount of red and purple paint is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.  

To determine the amount of red paint, we can use the fact that the red, white, and purple paint are equal.  Therefore, the amount of red paint is 6 pints * 3 pints/color = 18 pints.

"Colin's current age can be determined by analyzing the relationship between his age and Wendy's age in the future.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Wendy's age in the future:**  We know Wendy's age in 7 years will be 5 times Colin's age in 7 years. This can be represented as: W = 5(C + 7)
* **Colin's age in 25 years:**  We know in 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age. This can be represented as: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, we can solve for Colin's current age (C). 

**Solving for C:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

**Therefore, Colin is currently 12.5 years old.**

"The problem presents a classic physics scenario involving Newton's apple-throwing and the subsequent apple-harvesting.  

Let's break down the sequence of events:

1. **Initial State:** Two apples fall from the tree.
2. **First Throw:**  The initial throw of one apple back into the tree causes a cascade of 5 more apples to fall.
3. **Second Throw:**  The subsequent throw of the remaining apple causes another 6 apples to fall.

The key to this problem is the concept of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.  The initial apple falling on Newton's head is a result of the gravitational force between the apple and the Earth.  The subsequent throws of apples are also governed by the same force. 

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brings home is determined by the number of apples that were initially on the tree.

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs, we need to consider the ratio of slices per pizza. 

* **Cheese pizza:**  Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
* **Pepperoni pizza:** Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.

Kate consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.  

To find the number of cheese pizzas, we divide the total cheese slices consumed by the slices per pizza: 6 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 0.5 pizzas.  

To find the number of pepperoni pizzas, we divide the total pepperoni slices consumed by the slices per pizza: 4 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 0.5 pizzas. 

Since we can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to purchase 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase, we need to consider his total funds after completing his chores and purchasing the ice cream. 

First, we know Ryan earns $18 from his chores.  Then, he spends $3.75 on ice cream for himself and three friends.  This leaves him with $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.

Next, we need to calculate how many movie tickets he can buy with his remaining funds.  Tickets cost $6.50 each, so we divide his remaining funds by the ticket price: $14.25 / $6.50/ticket = 2.2 tickets.

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can purchase **2** movie tickets.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can utilize a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows.  We know the following:

* **c + w = 20**  (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for 'c':
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
