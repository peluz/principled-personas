"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio between Darrell and Allen.  Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162.  

Solving for x, we get: 18x = 162, therefore x = 162/18 = 9.

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for 'x', we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Since the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30', we can calculate that Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Dana's speed is a key factor in this problem.  We can break down the problem into two parts: running and walking. 

* **Running:** Dana runs at a speed four times faster than her walking speed.  We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour.  Therefore, her running speed is 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour.
* **Walking:** Dana spends two-thirds of her time walking, so she walks for 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to consider both running and walking.

* **Running Distance:** Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

* **Walking Distance:** Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance walking = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

"Gerald's improved speed is a result of a 10% increase in his performance.  To calculate his new time, we can use the following formula:

* **New Time = Original Time * (1 + Improvement Percentage)**

Let's break it down:

* **Original Time:** Gerald's original time is represented by 'x' seconds.
* **Improvement Percentage:** 10%
* **New Time:**  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation:
   x + 0.1x = 38

Solving for 'x':
* 1.1x = 38
* x = 38 / 1.1
* x = 34.55 (approximately)

Now, we can calculate Gerald's new time:

* **New Time = 34.55 * (1 + 0.1) = 34.55 * 1.1 = 37.995**

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately **37.995 seconds**.

"The hive's population is structured in a specific ratio.  We know there are 700 bees in total.  Let's break down the relationship between the bee types:

* **Queens:**  The number of queens (q) is the foundation of the hive's structure.
* **Baby Bees:**  The number of baby bees (b) is directly related to the number of queens.  
* **Worker Bees:**  Worker bees (w) are the most numerous group, and their number is directly related to the number of baby bees.

To determine the number of worker bees, we can use the following equation:

* **w = 2b** 

We can also express the number of baby bees in terms of the number of queens:

* **b = 2q**

Now, let's use the total bee population to solve for the number of bees in each category:

* **q + b + w = 700**

Substituting the values we know:

* **q + (2q) + 2(2q) = 700**

Simplifying the equation:

* **q + 2q + 4q = 700**
* **7q = 700**

Solving for q:

* **q = 100**

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:

* **w = 2b = 2 * 2q = 2 * 2 * 100 = 400**

Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* In two years, their combined age will be 28.

To find Seth's current age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Let Brooke's current age be represented by 'B'.**
2. **Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can express Seth's current age as '2B'.**
3. **In two years, Brooke will be B + 2 years old, and Seth will be 2B + 2 years old.**
4. **The sum of their ages in two years will be (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28**

Now, let's solve for B:

* **Combine like terms:** 3B + 4 = 28
* **Subtract 4 from both sides:** 3B = 24
* **Divide both sides by 3:** B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's current age, we can find Seth's age:

* **Seth's age is 2B, so Seth's age is 2 * 8 = 16**


**Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.**

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

**Explanation:**

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract it from the total time of the faster team. 

The less well-rounded team's time is calculated as follows:

* 60 seconds (first runner) + 3 seconds (second runner) + 3 seconds (third runner) + 3 seconds (fourth runner) = 69 seconds

The faster team's time is calculated as follows:

* 55 seconds (each runner) * 4 runners = 220 seconds

"To determine the number of rats per cage, we need to consider the total straw used with the rodents. 

* **Hamsters:** 10 cages of hamsters are given 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rats:**  We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total, and 50 pieces were used with hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We need to divide the remaining straw (110 pieces) by the number of rats to find the number of rats per cage. 
* **Rat per Cage:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats. 
* **Rounding:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we need to know the cost of a single pen.  Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined, we can calculate the cost of a single pen by finding the combined cost of a pencil and eraser and then dividing by 2.  

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30.  Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.  

The cost of a pen is equal to the combined cost of a pencil and eraser, so the cost of a pen is $1.50.  

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

"The problem presents a classic chicken-egg scenario!  Let's break it down:

We know the total number of eggs collected is 42.  We also know the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.  

To find the number of red chickens, we can use the following equation:

* **Total eggs = (Red eggs per day * Number of red chickens) + (White eggs per day * Number of white chickens)**

Let's plug in the known values:

* 42 = (3 * r) + (5 * w)

We also know that the number of red chickens is equal to the number of white chickens plus 2.  This can be represented as:

* **r = w + 2**

Now we can solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens)

1. **Substitute the value of 'r' from the second equation into the first equation:**
   42 = (3 * (w + 2)) + (5 * w)

2. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   42 = 3w + 6 + 5w
   42 = 8w + 6
   36 = 8w
   w = 4.5

3. **Since we can't have half a chicken, there is an error in the problem statement.** 


**Final Answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

* **Total for the first two days:** 100 + 150 = 250 customers.
* **Day 3:**  The total number of customers for the three days is 500.  Therefore, Sloane counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years.  

* **Adrian's age in three years:** Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* **Harriet's age in three years:** Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* **Zack's age in three years:** Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

* **Scene 2:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, which has 54 lines.  Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  He has 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines in the second scene.
* **Total:**  The total lines Sean needs to memorize is 36 + 48 = 84 lines.

"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Cards with A:** 80 cards * (2/5) = 32 cards
* **Cards remaining:** 80 cards - 32 cards = 48 cards
* **Cards with B:** 48 cards * (1/2) = 24 cards
* **Cards remaining after B:** 48 cards - 24 cards = 24 cards
* **Cards with C:** 24 cards * (5/8) = 15 cards

"To determine the combined number of spots, we first need to calculate the total number of spots for each snake species. 

* Cobras have 70 spots each, and there are 40 cobras in the park.  
* Mambas have 35 spots each, and there are 60 mambas in the park.

The total number of spots for all the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
The total number of spots for all the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

The total number of spots for all the snakes is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

To find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"To transport 80 flagstones, we need to determine the number of trucks required.  Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and the total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  

To calculate the number of trucks needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck: 

5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks

Since we can't have half a truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we will need **3 trucks** to transport the flagstones.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

* Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  

* 480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

* t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

To determine how much he can allocate to gifts for his business partners, we need to calculate the total cost of his trip expenses.

* **Business attire:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Luggage:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight ticket:**  The flight ticket cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500.  Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
* **Total trip expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

He has $6000 - $2350 = $3650 remaining for gifts.

* **Defense:**  We know the defense has 'x' players.
* **Offense:** The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.
* **Special Teams:** The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning there are x/2 players on special teams.

To find the number of players on the defense, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Combining like terms: (7/2)x = 105

Solving for x: x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"Job B offers a higher net pay rate compared to Job A.  Let's break down the calculations:

* **Job A:**
    * Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
    * Tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
    * Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

* **Job B:**
    * Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
    * Tax: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
    * Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size. The remaining group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following steps:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.**

* **The size of the smallest group is 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 3 times the number of students in the equal groups.**

* **We can set up an equation to represent this:** 3x + (x - 10) = 200

* **Solving for 'x':**
   * 4x - 10 = 200
   * 4x = 210
   * x = 52.5

* **Since the number of students cannot be a fraction, we need to re-evaluate our approach.**  The problem is likely designed to be a bit tricky.  The number of students in the smallest group is 52.5.

"The animals on Farmer Brown's farm have a total of 160 legs. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know the following:

* **c + w = 60** (The total number of animals is 60)
* **c = 2w** (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Solving for 'c' in the second equation:
* c = 2w

Substituting this into the first equation:
* 2w + w = 60
* 3w = 60
* w = 20 (The number of cows is 20)

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
* c = 2w = 2 * 20 = 40 (The number of chickens is 40)

Finally, calculate the total number of legs:
* Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person.  
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

To figure out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the total cost of the activities.  

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Mini-golf:**  Let's say she invites 'x' number of friends. The cost of mini-golf for all her friends is 5x.
* **Go-karts:** She wants to go twice, so the cost of go-karts is 10 * 2 = $20.

**Total cost:**  The total cost of the party is $5x + $20.

**To stay within her $90 budget, we need to find the value of 'x' that makes the total cost equal to or less than $90.**

**Let's set up an equation:**

5x + 20 = 90

**Solve for 'x':**

* Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x = 70
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14

**Answer:** Morgan can invite 14 friends.

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the service interval. 

The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  

The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles. 

To calculate the number of days between services, we divide the total distance traveled by the service interval:

Number of days between services = Total distance traveled / Service interval

Number of days between services = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/service = 0.375 service intervals. 

Since we need to round to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog bed type and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of 2 and 8.

To calculate the total stuffing for the chihuahua beds, we multiply the number of chihuahua beds by the stuffing per bed: 4 chihuahua beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds.

For the collie beds, we multiply the number of collie beds by the stuffing per bed: 3 collie beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.

Finally, to find the total stuffing needed, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Mel can save a significant amount of energy by reducing his AC usage.  Here's how to calculate the savings:

* **Daily Energy Consumption:** The AC uses 900 watts per hour, and he uses it for 8 hours daily, resulting in 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours of energy used per day.
* **Reduced Usage:**  He reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, so his daily energy consumption is now 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.
* **Energy Savings:**  Mel saves 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours per day.
* **Total Savings in 30 Days:** Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Kilowatt-Hour Conversion:**  1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 watt-hours. Therefore, Mel saves 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = **135 kWh** of energy.

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people, Tyson will need 5 sandwiches.  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.  

* **Meat:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
* **Cheese:** 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, so the total cost of meat is 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.

The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound, so the total cost of cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use the given information about the total number of heads and bumps. 

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.  We know:

* **Heads:**  c + d = 180
* **Bumps:** 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' in the first equation:
* c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

* **Total Earnings = Price per Card * Number of Cards**

We know the total earnings need to be $100.  Let's represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.

* **1.5x = $100**

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it.  Divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

* **x = $100 / 1.5**
* **x = 66.67**

Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.  Kenny needs to sell approximately **67** cards.

"To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to get 5 cookies, we can set up an equation.  

Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.  

The problem states that Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.  This translates to the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5

Solving for 'x', we get:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat **6** carrot sticks.

"To determine the number of guests that make the two venues cost the same, we need to set the cost equations equal to each other. 

Let's break down the costs:

* **Venue 1:**  The flat fee is $200, and the cost per guest is $5.  
* **Venue 2:** The cost per guest is $25.

Setting the cost equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * x = $25 * x

Where 'x' represents the number of guests.

Solving for 'x':

$200 = $20 * x

x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are needed for the two venues to have the same cost.

"To determine the number of insects Lily found, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

Let's use the following variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
*  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36

Multiplying both sides by 2: 5x = 72

Dividing both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now, we can find Lily's insects: (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found **14.2** insects.

To find the cost of the strawberry gum, we can use the following equation:

Total cost = (Cost of strawberry gum) + (Cost of green apple gum)

We know the total cost is $7.00 and the cost of the green apple gum is $1.00.  We can solve for the cost of the strawberry gum:

$7.00 = (Cost of strawberry gum) + $1.00

Subtracting $1.00 from both sides of the equation, we get:

$6.00 = (Cost of strawberry gum)

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $3.00.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which means the farm has 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  To find the total number of animals, we add the number of animals on the farm and the zoo: 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  The total number of animals at the farm and zoo is 50 animals + 80 animals = 130 animals.

* Rose's onions: 12
* Rose's potatoes: 4
* Sophia's onions: 12 / 4 = 3 
* Sophia's potatoes: 4 - 3 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

"Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, and she's adding a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour.  This means her total daily consumption will be 14 kilowatts per hour.  

To calculate her weekly consumption, we multiply her daily consumption by the number of days in a week: 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days/week = 98 kilowatts/week.

"The jar's composition is a classic example of a ""percentage-based"" problem.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.**  This is our starting point.
* **The statement ""1% fewer red jelly beans than blue"" translates to (0.99)b red jelly beans.**  This means the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans.
* **The statement ""1% more green jelly beans than blue"" translates to (1.01)b green jelly beans.** This means the number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans.

**To find the number of jelly beans, we can set up an equation:**

b + (0.99)b + (1.01)b = 4500

**Solving for 'b' (the number of blue jelly beans):**

1. Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500
2. Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:**

* Green jelly beans: (1.01) * 1500 = 1515

**Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:**

* Red jelly beans: (0.99) * 1500 = 1495
* Green jelly beans: 1515
* Difference: 1515 - 1495 = 20

**Answer:** The jar contains 20 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He’s already put down a deposit of $600.  

To determine the total cost of the implants, we need to consider the base price and the additional cost of the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500. 

To calculate the remaining amount George needs to pay, we subtract his deposit from the total cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900.

To figure out how many hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours. 


**Answer:**  George needs to work 126.67 hours.

"The angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We can represent the angles as follows:

*  Let 'x' represent the smallest angle.
*  The other two angles are: 2x and 3x.

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is 3 times the smallest angle, so:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees

* **Marissa's production:** Marissa produces 3/4 times Ruiz's production, meaning she produces (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

**Total production:**  Over 12 hours, Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa produces 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.  

Therefore, their combined production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  
   * Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  
   * This translates to: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.
   * This means the number of sheep plus the number of geese equals 20.
   * This translates to: s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' (the number of sheep) using these equations. 

**Solving for 's'**

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

**Answer:** There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we need to understand the relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns.  

The ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36.  This means that for every 6 potatoes, you can make 36 hash browns.

To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following proportion:

* 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for x, we get:

* 6 * x = 36 * 96
* 6x = 3456
* x = 3456 / 6
* x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know there's a set of twins and a set of triplets.
* One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
* Their combined ages are 44.

To find the age of the twin, we can use the following logic:

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

Since the ages of the twin and triplet are related by a difference of 7 years, we can express this relationship as:

* t = 3t - 7

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the combined ages:

* t + 3t = 44

Combining like terms:

* 4t = 44

Solving for 't':

* t = 44 / 4
* t = 11

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"The price of the crate of fruit is determined by the cost of each individual fruit.  

* **Apples:**  Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Bananas:**  Each banana costs twice the price of an apple, so it costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Oranges:** Each orange costs three times the price of a banana, so it costs $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of each fruit type:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

The total cost of the crate is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00. 

**Therefore, the price for the crate of fruit is $32.00.**

* **Small Stickers:** She starts with 30 small stickers, which is a good foundation for button production.
* **Large Stickers:**  She has 40 large stickers, which is a valuable resource for button production.
* **Trading Strategy:**  Lorraine's trading strategy is based on maximizing the value of her stickers. She prioritizes converting small stickers to large buttons, as this is the most efficient way to increase her button output.

"Bob's initial fish population was 7, with 3 orange and 4 white.  He added 17 fish to his pond, bringing the total to 24.  To determine the number of white fish purchased, we need to consider the ratio of orange to white fish after the addition.  Since he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up an equation:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of white fish purchased.**

The total number of fish after the addition is 24, and the ratio of orange to white fish is 2:1.  This means:

* **Orange fish = 2x**
* **White fish = x**

We know that the total number of fish is 24, so:

* **2x + x = 24**

Combining like terms:

* **3x = 24**

Solving for x:

* **x = 24 / 3**
* **x = 8**

Therefore, Bob purchased **8** white fish at the store.

"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for his birthday party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To determine how many more cupcakes he needs, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes he has: 8 + 40 = 48.  To find the number of cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.  Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes.

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20.  To find Joe's total number of cars, we multiply Robert's 20 by 2, resulting in 40 cars.  

After selling 20% of his cars, Joe has 40 - (0.20 * 40) = 40 - 8 = 32 cars remaining.

Joe then gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

Finally, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars remaining.

"To determine Becca's card count, we need to consider the relationships between the three individuals' card collections. 

Let's break it down:

* **PJ's cards:**  Let's represent the number of cards PJ has with the variable 'x'.
* **Smendrick's cards:** Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so he has 3x cards.
* **Becca's cards:** Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341.  We can express this mathematically as:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

This means PJ has 47 cards.  

To find Becca's cards, we substitute the value of x back into the expression for Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

* **Refund:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.00.  
* **Final Calculation:** The total cost Milly will pay is $3.00.  The refund will be $24.00, leaving Milly with a loss of $21.00.

"Boris's production pattern is a classic example of a cyclical pattern.  To determine his production in week 4, we need to consider the total production for the first three weeks. 

* Week 1: 8,000 bars
* Week 2: 4,000 bars
* Week 3: 24,000 bars

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find the production in week 4, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from his monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, who in turn has saved $10.00 more than Eva.  Eva saved $20.00.  To determine Roy's savings, we can break down the relationship:

* **Eva's savings:** Eva saved $20.00.
* **Anthony's savings:** Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, meaning he saved 1.40 times Anthony's amount.  Therefore, Roy saved 1.40 * $30.00 = $42.00.

"Naruto's lifting capacity is directly proportional to the mountain's height.  We know that Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.  

To determine Naruto's lifting capacity, we can use the following logic:

* **Saskay's lifting ability:** Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches. 

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot: 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"Mason travels 32 miles in the first leg of his journey at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours.  He then takes a rest, and then travels for another 6 hours at the same speed.  

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to consider the time spent on each leg of the journey. 

* **Leg 1:** 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
* **Leg 2:** 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Therefore, Mason travels a total of 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

"To determine the time it takes four turtles to traverse the highway, we need to consider the relationship between the number of turtles, their individual speeds, and the total distance. 

Here's how we can approach this:

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key is to recognize that the turtles' speed is directly proportional to the time it takes them to complete the journey.  
* **Calculating the Time:**  Since the distance is constant, the time taken is inversely proportional to the speed.  

**Therefore, the time taken by four turtles will be half the time taken by one kangaroo.**

   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Age Relationships:** We know the ages of the siblings are related by a specific pattern.  
* **Mom's Age:**  The mother's age is one less than three times the brother's age. 

To find the age of each person, we can use a system of equations. 

Let's represent the ages:

* Your age:  *x*
* Your brother's age: *x + 3*
* Your sister's age: *x - 2*
* Mom's age: 3(*x + 3*) - 1

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total age of all four:

"To determine the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we need to consider their badge earning rates. 

* **Claire:** Earning one badge per month.
* **Amber:** Earning half as many badges as Claire, so she earns 1/2 badge per month.
* **Wendy:** Earning three times the amount of badges as Claire, so she earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns, which is 3 * 1 = 3 badges per month.

The difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber is 3 - 0.5 = 2.5 badges per month. 

Over a year, Wendy earns 2.5 badges/month * 12 months = 30 more badges than Amber.

"To determine the number of books Fawn has, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of books Fawn has as ""F"".  

We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.  This translates to the following equations:

* Sofie's books: F - 12 + 25
* Anne's books: F - 12

The total number of books is 85.  Therefore:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation:

3F + 13 = 85

Solving for F:

3F = 72
F = 24

Therefore, Fawn has **24** books.

Now, let's calculate the cost of David's purchase:

* **Soda Cost:** 3 bottles of soda * $3.00/bottle = $9.00
* **Water Cost:** 2 bottles of water * $2.00/bottle = $4.00
* **Total Cost:** $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"Melanie's age in 10 years will be 18 years old.  To find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.
*  Her age in 'x' years will be 8 + x.
*  We know that her age will be thrice her present age, so: 8 + x = 3 * 8

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we can use the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  

* **Let's represent their ages:**
    * Peter's age: P
    * Paul's age: P + 10
    * John's age: J

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * P + (P + 10) + J = 100  (The sum of their ages is 100)
    * P = (P + 10) + J  (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = (P + 10) + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

* **Let D represent Dinar's score.**
* **Let A represent Azibo's score.**
* **Let B represent Bahati's score.**

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

We can substitute the values of B from the first two equations into the third equation:

(A + 20) + (D + 10) + (D + 10) = 45

Simplifying the equation:

2A + 2D + 40 = 45

Now, we can solve for D:

2A + 2D = 5

Since we know that A = D - 10, we can substitute that into the equation:

2(D - 10) + 2D = 5

Simplifying:

2D - 20 + 2D = 5

4D - 20 = 5

4D = 25

D = 6.25

Now that we know D, we can find A:

A = D - 10

A = 6.25 - 10

A = -3.75

Therefore, Azibo scored -3.75 points.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are all Pokemon enthusiasts, and they've caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  To figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught, we need to use a bit of algebra.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation:
        (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the cost of filling Pat's flower bed, we need to consider the dimensions and spacing of the plants. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches.  111 feet is equal to 111 * 12 inches = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to determine the number of plants that can fit within the flower bed.  We know the plants are 12 inches wide and need 1.5 feet of space between each plant.  Therefore, the total width of the bed is 1332 inches, and we can calculate the number of plants that can fit by dividing the total width by the width of each plant: 1332 inches / 12 inches/plant = 111 plants.

Since Pat already owns 17 plants, we need to calculate the number of additional plants she needs to purchase.  The number of additional plants is 111 plants - 17 plants = 94 plants.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the plants.  Each plant costs $6, and Pat needs to purchase 94 plants, so the total cost is 94 * $6 = $564.

"Marcus has a 80% chance of needing to turn in his homework tomorrow. 

Here's why:

* **Probability of no homework:** 50% (substitute teacher) * 40% (extension) = 20%
* **Probability of no homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 100% (no extension) = 20%
* **Probability of homework:** 100% - 20% = 80%
* **Probability of homework and no extension:** 20% (no homework) * 60% (extension) = 12%
* **Probability of homework and extension:** 20% (no homework) * 40% (extension) = 8%

"To determine the time it takes Jim to recoup his loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the total amount he needs to earn. 

Jim's degree increases his annual income by a factor of three, meaning he earns $75,000 per year after college.  

* **Total income from college:**  Over four years, he earns $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.
* **Total loan payments:** He pays $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000 in loans.
* **Total lost income:**  He loses $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000 in income while in school.
* **Total to earn:**  To recoup his loan payments and lost income, Jim needs to earn $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

Therefore, it will take Jim **4 years** to earn the equivalent of his loan payments and lost income.

"Jim needs fabric for a king-sized bed, which is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To ensure a proper fit, he'll need fabric that is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  

The fabric pieces will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.  

To calculate the total area of fabric needed, we need to consider the area of the bed and the area of each fabric piece. 

The bed has an area of 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.

Each fabric piece has an area of 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric.

"The car's value depreciates by 21% each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"James' insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  The normal monthly premium is $120.  To calculate his annual premium, we need to consider the increased cost.

The increased cost is 60% of the normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his annual premium is $120 + $72 = $192. 

His annual premium is $192.

"Greg needs to wash 5 beds per week, and his laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.  To determine the number of loads he does in a year, we need to consider the number of sets he washes per week and the number of loads the machine can handle. 

Greg washes 5 beds per week, and his laundry machine can handle 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.  Therefore, he washes 5 beds / 2 sets/load = 2.5 loads per week. 

Greg washes 2.5 loads per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year.  Therefore, Greg washes 2.5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 130 loads per year.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.
* Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.

To find the duration of Betsy's portion, we can use the following equation:

*  Betsy's portion time = Donovan's portion time + 18 minutes

Let's represent Donovan's portion time with the variable 'x'.  

* Betsy's portion time = x + 18

We know that the total time is 98 minutes, so:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.

* Betsy's portion time = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.**
* **Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.**

We know the total fence length is 100 feet:  x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Solving for 'x':
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total: 100 - 80 = 20

"The scenario describes a food chain interaction.  The Allosaurus consumed the remaining meat after the T-Rex and velociraptors had their share.  To determine the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to consider the following:

* **T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat, which represents half of the remaining amount after the T-Rex's initial consumption.
* **Velociraptor's Consumption:** The velociraptors consumed half of the remaining meat after the T-Rex's initial consumption.

Therefore, the original amount of meat on the triceratops can be calculated as follows:

* **T-Rex's initial consumption:** 270 kilograms
* **Velociraptors' consumption:** 270 kilograms / 2 = 135 kilograms
* **Original amount of meat:** 270 kilograms / 2 = 135 kilograms

To determine the difference in ride time, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each slide.

For the biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide, the time is calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in ride time is: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"The problem states that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light.  We know that 6 jellyfish changed color.  To find the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following equation:

* **Total jellyfish = (Number of large jellyfish) * (Number of large jellyfish that change color) / (Number of jellyfish that change color)**

We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, and a third of the large jellyfish change color.  Therefore, we can solve for the number of large jellyfish:

* **Number of large jellyfish = (Number of jellyfish that change color) * (Total jellyfish) / (Number of jellyfish that change color)**

We can plug in the values we know to solve for the total number of jellyfish:

* **Total jellyfish = (6 jellyfish) * (Total jellyfish) / (6 jellyfish)**

This simplifies to:

* **Total jellyfish = (Total jellyfish)**

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is **90**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  
* We can represent this as 2x, where x is the number of eggs each of them painted.
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  
*  We can represent this as 2y, where y is the number of eggs Sarah painted.
*  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 

**Let's solve for the number of eggs each person painted:**

*  We know that 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  We also know that y = 22 - x
*  Substitute the value of y into the equation: 2(22 - x) + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  Simplify: 44 - 2x + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  Combine like terms: 56 = 56 

**Therefore, we can conclude that:**

*  Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs. 
*  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to organize them into groups of 8 crayons per box. Each box weighs 8 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  

To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of boxes and the weight of each box. 

* **Number of boxes:** 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes
* **Total weight of boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces
* **Total weight of crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces
* **Total weight:** 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we divide the total weight in ounces by 16 ounces per pound. 

* **Total weight in pounds:** 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this relationship with an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Solving for x:

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

The length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters.  To find the length of the red rope, we use the equation:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.


**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  To find the length of the longer piece, we need to know the length of the shorter piece.  

Let's represent the length of the shorter piece with the variable 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times the length of the shorter piece, which can be represented as 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 8.

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"Mary is making ice cubes with fruit frozen in them for a cocktail party. She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?

To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we need to consider the relationship between the number of strawberry cubes and the number of blueberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. The number of blueberry cubes is then calculated as 5x - 4.  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Solving for x:
* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. 

The number of blueberry cubes is calculated as 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

"To determine the time it takes John to speak 10 pages, we need to consider his speaking speed and the word count per page. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **John's speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)
* **John's new speed:** 2.5 times faster than his starting speed, so his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM
* **Words per page:** 450 words
* **Total words:** 10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it takes John to speak 4500 words at his new speed:

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To determine the number of weeks to fill the holes, we need to consider the rate at which Nate fills the holes and the rate at which the dog digs. 

* **Filling rate:** Nate fills 9 holes per day.
* **Digging rate:** The dog digs 6 holes per night.

To find the total number of holes filled, we need to consider the number of days Nate is filling the holes. 

* **Total holes filled:** 126 holes.

To find the number of weeks to fill the holes, we need to divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled per day. 

* **Weeks to fill:** 126 holes / 9 holes/day = 14 days. 

Therefore, it takes Nate **14 days** to fill all the holes.

"To determine the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. 

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get:
* **c = 20 - w**

Substituting this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* **2(20 - w) + 4w = 70**

Simplifying and solving for 'w':
* **40 - 2w + 4w = 70**
* **2w = 30**
* **w = 15**

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 20 - w:
* **c = 20 - 15**
* **c = 5**

Therefore, there are **5** chickens on the farm.
