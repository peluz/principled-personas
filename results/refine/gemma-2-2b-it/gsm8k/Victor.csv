"To determine Allen's age in 10 years, we need to consider the age ratio and the current ages of Darrell and Allen. 

Since their ages are in the ratio 7:11, we can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively, where x is a constant.  

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:

18x = 162

Solving for x:

x = 162 / 18 = 9

This means Darrell's current age is 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's current age is 11 * 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:

99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be **109**.

"Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins with the variable 'x'.  Therefore, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.  To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation: 110 = x + (x + 30).  Solving for 'x', we get 110 = 2x + 30, which simplifies to 80 = 2x.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.  Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins, and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"The truck's maximum payload capacity is 5000 pounds.  To determine the maximum number of boxes, we need to consider the weight of the boxes and the truck's weight. 

The weight of the boxes is 15 pounds per box, and we need to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. 

Let's calculate:

"Gerald's improved speed is a result of a 10% increase in his performance.  To calculate his new time, we need to consider the impact of this improvement on his original time. 

Let's break it down:

* **Gerald's original time:**  We know Lee ran the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.  
* **Lee's advantage:** Lee ran 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
* **Calculating Gerald's new time:**  We can represent Gerald's original time as 'x' and Lee's time as 'x + 2'.  We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   x + 2 = 38

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 36

Now, to calculate Gerald's new time, we need to add the 10% improvement to his original time.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years, and we need to find the total salary he and Lylah were earning four years later. 

* Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. 
* We know his salary now is 1.4 times his salary four years ago.

To find his current salary, we can use the following equation:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  

* We can set up an equation: Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30
* We know Adrien's salary is $56,000. 
* Therefore, Lylah's salary is $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate their total salary four years later:

Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary = $56,000 + $30,77 = $86,77 (approximately)


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was approximately $86,77.**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of pink gumballs.
*  We know that 'x' is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.  This translates to the equation: x = 4 * blue gumballs + 22

Since we know there are 12 blue gumballs, we can substitute that into the equation:

x = 4 * 12 + 22

Simplifying the equation:

x = 48 + 22

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.  In two years, their ages will sum to 28.  

* Let's represent Seth's current age as ""S"" and Brooke's current age as ""B"".

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

* S = 2B  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

To solve for Seth's age, we can use the following steps:

1. **Substitute S = 2B into the second equation:**
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Combine like terms:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Subtract 2 from both sides:**
   3B = 26

4. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. **Now that we know Brooke's age (B), substitute it back into the equation S = 2B:**
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"The rats are distributed in groups of 6 pieces of straw per rat.  We know that 160 pieces of straw were used in total.  To find the number of rats, we can use the following formula:

* **Total straw used = number of rats * pieces of straw per rat**

We can solve for the number of rats:

* **Number of rats = Total straw used / pieces of straw per rat**

Plugging in the values:

* **Number of rats = 160 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 26.67 rats**

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Therefore, there are 26 rats in total.**

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we need to consider the relationship between the cost of a pen and the combined cost of a pencil and eraser.  

Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by considering the cost of a single pen. 

The cost of a single pen is $1.50.  Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is:

8 pens * $1.50/pen = $12.00

"Elaine's Pokemon collection is a fascinating study in growth!  Let's break down her collection progression:

* **Month 1:** She starts with 20 cards and adds 3 times that amount, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She then collects 20 fewer cards than in Month 1, so she acquires 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 3:**  She doubles the total from the first two months, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  Then, she adds 200 cards to that total.

Therefore, her total collection is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = **320** cards.

"The problem presents a classic chicken-egg scenario with a potential inconsistency.  Let's break it down:

* **Egg Production:**  The key is to understand the relationship between the number of red and white chickens and the total number of eggs produced.  
* **The Discrepancy:** The problem states that Jerry collects 42 eggs, and we know the red and white chickens produce a total of 42 eggs.  However, the number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3 per day, and the number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5 per day. 
* **The Issue:**  The problem states that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.  This is a key piece of information that we need to use to solve for the number of red chickens. 

**To solve this, we need to find a way to express the number of red chickens in terms of the number of white chickens.** 

Let's use the information given to set up an equation. 

* **Equation:** 3r + 5w = 42 
* **Equation:** r = w + 2

**Solving for 'r'**

* **Substitute:**  We can substitute the second equation into the first equation. 
* **Simplify:** 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
* **Solve:** 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* **Combine:** 8w + 6 = 42
* **Isolate 'w':** 8w = 36
* **Solve for 'w':** w = 4.5

**The Problem:**  We can't have half a chicken.  This means there is an error in the problem statement.

* **Water Loss:**  The problem states the pools have lost 16 gallons in 4 minutes.

**The Problem:** The problem is inconsistent.  A pool emptying at a constant rate will always have a consistent rate of water loss.  

**Conclusion:**  The problem as stated is not solvable.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, or 30 miles per hour.  To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we can use the following formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour.  Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  

Therefore:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Ali and Izzy have a combined total of 39 medals.  We also know that they represent a fraction of the total medals awarded.  To find the total number of medals given out, we need to figure out how many medals represent Ali and Izzy's total. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as ""x"".  We can set up an equation:

* Ali and Izzy's medals: 39
* Total medals given out: x

We know that Ali and Izzy's medals represent 1/10th of the total medals given out.  Therefore:

* 39 = (1/10) * x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

* 390 = x

"Theo has a budget of $6000 for his business trip to South Africa.  He's purchasing business attire, luggage, and a flight.  

Let's analyze his spending:

* **Business Suits:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Luggage:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight:** The flight cost is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so we can calculate it as follows: 
    * 5 * $100 = $500
    * $700 more than $500 is $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total Spending:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350
* **Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650
* **Gift Budget:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

"The phone charges at a rate of 1% per 3 minutes. To reach 100% charge, the phone needs to gain 40% of charge, which is equivalent to 40/100 * 100 = 40% of the total charge.  

To calculate the time required, we can use the following formula:

Time = (Target Charge / Charging Rate) * 3 minutes

In this case, the target charge is 100% and the charging rate is 1% per 3 minutes.  

Therefore, the time required to reach 100% charge is:

Time = (100 / 1) * 3 = 300 minutes.

Finally, convert the time to hours:

"Job B offers a higher net pay, but the difference is significant.  Let's break it down:

* **Job A:**  $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000 gross pay.  A 20% tax rate means Nick pays $6,000 in taxes, leaving him with $24,000 net pay.

* **Job B:**  $42,000 gross pay.  First, we need to calculate the net income after property tax.  $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.  Then, a 10% tax rate on the remaining $36,000 is $3,600.  This leaves Nick with a net pay of $32,400.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.  

**Answer:** Job B offers a net pay of $8,400 more than Job A.

"The class is divided into three groups, with two groups having the same size.  The third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two.  To find the size of the smallest group, we can use the following logic:

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
* The size of the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups: 2x + (x - 10) = 200.

Solving for 'x', we get: 3x - 10 = 200
                                       3x = 210
                                       x = 70

Therefore, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = **60** students.

* **Mini-golf:**  A round of mini-golf costs $5 per person.  
* **Arcade Tokens:** She has $5 for arcade tokens.
* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.

To find the maximum number of friends she can invite, let's consider the total cost:

"The train's service interval is based on the total distance traveled.  To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in a day and then divide that by the service interval.

* **Total distance traveled per day:** 675 miles (3 trips * 225 miles/trip)
* **Service interval:** 18,000 miles

**Calculation:**

* Days between services = Total distance traveled / Service interval
* Days between services = 675 miles / 18,000 miles/day = 0.3875 days

**Rounding to the nearest whole number:**

* The train needs service every 0.3875 days, which rounds to **1 day**.

"To determine the total stuffing needed, we need to consider the stuffing requirements for each dog breed and the number of beds we're making. 

* Rottweiler beds require 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Chihuahua beds require 2 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds require an average of 5 pounds of stuffing, calculated as the average of the two previous types.

For the chihuahua beds, we need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collie beds, we need 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, the total stuffing needed is 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

"Based on the provided information, we can determine the number of individuals kicked out for other reasons. 

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 customers were removed for refusing to wear masks.
* **Shoplifting:** 12 individuals were removed for shoplifting.
* **Physical Violence:** 21 individuals were removed for physical violence.

To find the number of individuals removed for other reasons, we can subtract the number of individuals removed for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of individuals removed:

Total individuals removed - (Mask Refusal + Shoplifting + Physical Violence) = Other Reasons

Therefore, the number of individuals removed for other reasons is: 50 - 12 - 7 - 21 = 10.

* **Anna's assets:** Anna has twice the silver pesos Axel has, meaning she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.  Additionally, she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, totaling 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* **Total assets:** To find the total amount of pesos they have, we add Axel's and Anna's assets: 50 + 80 + 100 + 120 = 350 pesos.

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 350.

"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  To determine his original land size, we can use the following proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the original amount of land.
*  He sold (3/5)x hectares.
*  The remaining land is represented by (2/5)x.
*  We know (2/5)x = 12.8 hectares.

Solving for x:

*  Multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
*  Calculate: x = 32 hectares.

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially owned 32 hectares of land.

"The ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, representing a total of 165 popsicles.  To determine the difference in popsicles between them, we can utilize the concept of proportions. 

Let's represent the value of one ratio part as 'x'.  

* Betty's popsicles: 5x
* Sam's popsicles: 6x

The total popsicles are 165, so: 5x + 6x = 165

Combining like terms: 11x = 165

Solving for x: x = 165 / 11 = 15

Betty has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

The difference in popsicles between Sam and Betty is 90 - 75 = 15.

"Mel's energy consumption is a straightforward calculation.  He uses 900 watts per hour, and his AC is on for 8 hours daily.  If he reduces his usage by 5 hours, his daily energy consumption drops to 2700 watt-hours.  

To determine the total energy saved over 30 days, we need to consider the difference in energy consumption.  

**Here's how to calculate the energy savings:**

* **Daily energy savings:** 7200 watt-hours (original) - 2700 watt-hours (reduced) = 4500 watt-hours

* **Total energy savings in kilowatt-hours:** 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours

**Therefore, Mel will save 4.5 kilowatt-hours of energy over 30 days.**

* **Short Walk:** He then took an additional 1,000 steps on his walk with his friend.
* **Remaining Steps:** After his short walk, he had 2,000 steps remaining.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took for the school commute and the short walk from the total steps he had left: 10,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 = 2,000.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Joanne's apples:**  We know Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.  
* **Sister's apples:**  Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, meaning she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:**  The sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:**  Joanne's sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:**  To find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees, we need to find the value of x.

"The problem presents a classic case of simultaneous equations.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries using a simple substitution method. 

Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Tom's trip can be broken down into two distinct phases: the initial European exploration and the subsequent journey. 

**Phase 1: Initial Exploration**

* **Days 1-4:** Tom covered 200 kilometers per day for four consecutive days, totaling 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

**Phase 2: The Second Week**

* **Days 5-7:** Tom traveled for two days, covering 30% of the distance from Phase 1, which is 800 km * 0.30 = 240 kilometers. 
* **Day 8:** Tom did not travel.
* **Days 9-14:** Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for seven days, totaling 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

"Kenny needs to sell enough Pokemon cards to cover the $100 amusement park ticket.  We can represent the number of cards he has with the variable 'x'.  

To determine the number of cards he needs to sell, we can set up an equation:

* **Earnings:** 1.5x 
* **Cost:** $100

We know that he has $50 in cash, so we can set up the equation:

* 1.5x = $100

* Divide both sides by 1.5: x = $100 / 1.5 = 66.67

Since we need a whole number of cards, we round this to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the relationship between the quantities they purchased.  Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4x onions.

We know Rose bought 12 onions, so we can write the proportion: 
 
 4x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 / 4 = 3

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, we can find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.  We can use the same proportion to find the number of potatoes Sophia bought:

*  Let 'y' represent the number of potatoes Sophia bought.
*  Rose bought 4y potatoes.

We know Rose bought 4 potatoes, so we can write the proportion:

4y = 4

Solving for y, we get:

y = 4 / 4 = 1

Therefore, Sophia bought 1 potato.

Finally, to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought:

3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes.

"The problem states that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's break down the relationship between the different colors of jelly beans.

* **Blue jelly beans:**  Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.
* **Red jelly beans:**  The number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 0.99b.
* **Green jelly beans:** The number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 1.01b.

To find the number of jelly beans in the jar, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, we can calculate the number of green jelly beans:

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, we can determine the difference between green and red jelly beans:

Difference = 1515 - 1495 = 20

**Answer:** The jar contains 20 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Jerry's age is a function of his age five years ago.  We can express this relationship as:

*  Current age = 2 * (Age five years ago)

To find Jerry's age in three years, we need to consider his current age and add three to it. 

Let's calculate:

*  Age five years ago = Current age - 5
*  Age in three years = Current age + 3

We know that the current age is equal to twice the age five years ago.  Therefore, we can substitute the expression for age five years ago into the equation for current age:

*  Current age = 2 * (Age five years ago) = 2 * (Current age - 5)

Solving for the current age:

*  Current age = 2 * (Current age - 5)
*  Current age = 2 * Current age - 10
*  Current age + 10 = 2 * Current age
*  10 = Current age

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

In three years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for two dental implants, each costing $2000 with an additional $500 for a porcelain crown.  His initial deposit is $600.  

To determine the total cost, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the crown. The total cost of the implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.  The crown adds an extra $500, bringing the total cost to $4000 + $500 = $4500.

To calculate the number of hours George needs to work, we need to consider his hourly wage and the remaining amount to be paid.  He needs to earn $4500 - $600 = $3900.  

To find the number of hours needed, we divide the total amount needed by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.

"Jim has a 20-pack of gum.  He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  He also gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?

**Answer:** 14 

**Explanation:**

* **Gum chewed at school:**  He chews 1 piece every 2 hours, and he's at school for 8 hours, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.
* **Total gum chewed:** He chews 4 pieces at school + 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 6 pieces.
* **Gum given to sister:** He gives his sister half his remaining gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s). To convert this to megabits per second (Mb/s), we need to know that 1 megabit is equal to 1000 kilobits. 

Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20 kb/s * 1000 = 20000 bits per second. 

To convert bits per second to megabits per hour, we need to consider that there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.  

Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20000 bits/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72000000 bits/hour. 

Finally, we need to convert bits per hour to megabits per hour. 

Her internet connection speed is 72000000 bits/hour / 1000 = **72 Mb/hour**.

"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we can use a system of equations based on the given information. 

Let 's' represent the number of sheep and 'g' represent the number of geese.  

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of legs is 70.  Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  So, we can write this as: 4s + 2g = 70
* **Equation 2:** The total number of heads is 20.  This means s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' using either substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

To find the amount of money Sarah has left, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the money she made from selling the old rope. 

**Therefore, the final answer is dependent on the number of meters of the new rope Sarah buys.**

"To determine the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be three times her current age, we can use a simple algebraic equation. 

Let 'x' represent the number of years it will take.  

Melanie's age in 'x' years will be: 8 + x

We know that this age will be three times her current age, so:

8 + x = 3 * 8

Solving for 'x':

8 + x = 24
x = 24 - 8
x = 16

Therefore, it will take **16** years for her age to be thrice her present age.

"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.  A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob.  If a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, how fast does a whirligig spin?

**Solution:**

To determine the speed of a whirligig, we need to consider the relationship between the speeds of the three objects.  

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, meaning the whatchamacallit's speed is 11 times greater than the thingamabob's speed.
* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second. 
* Therefore, the thingamabob's speed is 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.
* The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob, so its speed is 11 meters per second * 5 = 55 meters per second.

**Answer:** 55 meters per second

* Total bologna = (Number of red balloons) * (Bologna per red balloon) + (Number of yellow balloons) * (Bologna per yellow balloon)

We can solve for the number of yellow balloons:

* 58 = 20 * 2 + (Number of yellow balloons) * 3
* 58 = 40 + (Number of yellow balloons) * 3
* 18 = (Number of yellow balloons) * 3
* 6 = (Number of yellow balloons)

Therefore, there are **6** yellow balloons in the bundle.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We need to find Peter's age.

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Peter's age: P
    * Paul's age: P + 10
    * John's age: J

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine Azibo's score, we need to break down the given information and apply a strategic approach. 

Let's represent the scores as follows:

* Dinar: D
* Azibo: A
* Bahati: B

We know the following:

* B = A + 20 
* B = D + 10
* A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to find A:

* A + D + (A + 20) = 45
* 2A + D + 20 = 45
* 2A + D = 25

We can then solve for D using the third equation:

* A + D + (D + 10) = 45
* A + D + D + 10 = 45
* 2A + D = 35

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the previous equation into the second equation:

* 2(25 - D) + D = 25
* 50 - 2D + D = 25
* -D = -25
* D = 25

Finally, we can find A:

* A = 25 - D
* A = 25 - 25
* A = 0

Therefore, Azibo scored 0 points.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that the total number of chips is represented by a variable, 'x'.  We also know that the number of chips each person gets is determined by the number of people involved.  

* **Let's represent the number of people as 'n'**
* **The number of chips each person gets is 'x/n'**

We are given that two people get an equal amount of chips, and the remaining person gets 15 more than the others.  This can be represented as:

* **x/n = 70**
* **x/n = 70 + 15**

We can solve for 'x' by combining the two equations:

* **x/n = 85**
* **x = 85n**

We can now substitute this value of 'x' into the equation for the number of chips each person gets:

* **85n/n = 70**
* **85 = 70**

This equation is not true, so there is an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down this problem.  We need to determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.  

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  The key is recognizing that the adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice. This means the adult's slice is represented by 2x, where x is the size of a kid's slice.

* **Calculating the Total:**  We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are a total of 6 slices.

* **Percentage Calculation:**  To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to express the adult's slice as a fraction of the total slices.  This fraction is (2x / 6).  To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100%.

**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (2x/6) * 100%.**

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the required down payment savings. 

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

* Hourly wage: $10
* Hourly tips: $15
* Total weekly earnings: $10 + $15 = $25

Next, we need to determine her weekly savings:

* Total weekly earnings: $25
* Savings per week: $25 * 0.20 = $5

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks to reach her savings goal:

* Total savings needed: $10000
* Weekly savings: $5
* Number of weeks: $10000 / $5 = 2000 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work for **2000** weeks to save the down payment.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Teresa sells large stuffed animals at three times the price of small stuffed animals.  This means the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal.

We also know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large stuffed animals.  This means the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 times the number of large stuffed animals sold.

Let's use the information we have to solve for the number of small stuffed animals sold.

* Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
* Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
* The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.
* The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.
* The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.
* The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.
* Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.
* Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

"A steel pickaxe provides a significant boost in ore extraction.  With a steel pickaxe, each dwarf can mine 18 pounds per day, a 50% increase over the 12 pounds of ore mined with an iron pickaxe.  

To calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes over a 30-day period, we can use the following:

* **Daily Output:** 40 dwarves * 18 pounds/dwarf = 720 pounds
* **Total Output:** 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine **21,600** pounds of ore in a month.

"Marcus's homework situation presents a classic probability problem with multiple potential outcomes.  Let's analyze the probabilities:

* **Substitute Teacher:** There's a 50% chance the substitute teacher won't collect the homework.
* **Normal Teacher:** There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension.
* **Extension:** Even if the normal teacher doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her his dog ate his assignment.

To find the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, we need to consider all the possible scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Substitute teacher, no extension.
* **Scenario 2:** Normal teacher, no extension.
* **Scenario 3:** Normal teacher, extension.
* **Scenario 4:** Substitute teacher, extension.

The probability of each scenario is:

* **Scenario 1:** 0.50 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 2:** 0.50 * 0.60 = 0.30
* **Scenario 3:** 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20
* **Scenario 4:** 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20

The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.20 = **0.80**

**Therefore, the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 80%.**

"Jim needs fabric for a king-sized bed, which is a standard size.  To ensure a proper fit, he'll need to purchase two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  

The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet.  To calculate the area of the fabric, we need to consider the dimensions of the fabric pieces.  

* **Fabric Length:** The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer than the bed, so they are 6 + 2 = 8 feet long.
* **Fabric Width:** The fabric pieces are 2 feet wider than the bed, so they are 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

The area of the bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

To calculate the area of each fabric piece, we multiply the length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs to purchase two fabric pieces, each with an area of 80 square feet.  The total area of fabric needed is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

* **Wednesday:** Twice the number delivered on Tuesday, which is 102 * 2 = 204 letters. Adding 5 to this gives us 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 425 + 102 + 209 = **736** letters.

"Let's break down this fence problem.  

We know the total length of fence is 100 feet.  Let's represent the amount of fence Sam has with the variable 'x'.  Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, so he has 'x + 60' feet.  

The total length of fence is the sum of their individual lengths: x + (x + 60) = 100.  

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.  Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 20.  

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20.

"The problem states that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color under UV light.  This means that the number of large jellyfish is 5/10th of the total jellyfish population.  We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color under UV light.  

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can use the following equation:

* **Total jellyfish = (Number of large jellyfish) * (Number of large jellyfish that change color) / (Number of jellyfish that change color)**

We can then solve for the total number of jellyfish.

"Let's break down this retirement planning scenario.  

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to consider her savings rate and her projected living expenses. 

* **Savings Rate:** Lauren saves 20% of her annual income, which is a solid starting point.
* **Living Expenses:**  She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is a common approach for retirement planning.

**Calculating the Savings Gap:**

To figure out how much more she needs to save, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to accumulate over 20 years. 

* **Total Savings Needed:**  Lauren wants to save $1,200,000 for retirement.

**Determining the Timeframe:**

* **Years to Save:**  She needs to save $1,200,000.  
* **Annual Savings:**  She saves $60,000 per year.
* **Years to Work:**  $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.


**Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 20 more years to reach her retirement savings goal.**

"The fastest car ever made is a topic of much discussion in the automotive world.  To determine its top speed, we need to consider the relative performance of different vehicles. 

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which is a common benchmark for performance.  

The average car's speed is 120 mph.  Therefore, the 2nd fastest car is 120 * 5 = 600 mph.

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, which is 600 mph.  Therefore, the fastest car's speed is 600 * 1.25 = 750 mph.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs.  Since they painted the same number, we can represent that as:

*  Arnold's eggs + Madeline's eggs = 56

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.  We can represent this as:

*  Camden's eggs + Sarah's eggs = 30

To find the number of eggs each person painted, we can use the following steps:

1.  **Camden's eggs:**  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let's represent Sarah's eggs as 'y'.  Therefore, Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.

2.  **Sarah's eggs:** We know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30.  We can represent this as:  'y + (y + 12) = 30'

3.  **Solving for y:**  Simplify the equation: '2y + 12 = 30'
   * Subtract 12 from both sides: '2y = 18'
   * Divide both sides by 2: 'y = 9'

4.  **Camden's eggs:**  We know that Camden painted 'y + 12' eggs.  Substitute the value of 'y' we just found: '9 + 12 = 21'

5.  **The difference:**  To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we can use the following equation: 'Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs = 21 - 11 = 10'


**Answer:** Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold.

"To determine the number of seashells each person receives, we need to break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Carlos's Seashells:**  We know Jim collected 27 seashells, and this was 5 more than Carlos's collection.  Therefore, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
* **Carrey's Seashells:**  Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.  This means Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.
* **Total Seashells:**  The total number of seashells collected is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.
* **Equally Divided:**  To find out how many seashells each person gets, we divide the total seashells by the number of people: 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"The IRS typically receives a consistent volume of tax reports throughout the week.  To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can analyze the total reports received over the week. 

The total number of reports received is 5168.  We know that Monday and Tuesday combined totaled 1907 reports, and Thursday and Friday totaled 2136 reports.  Subtracting these totals from the total number of reports gives us the number of reports received on Wednesday: 5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125. 

Therefore, the IRS received **1125** reports on Wednesday.

"The problem states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  We can represent this relationship with the following equation:

*  Red Rope Length = 4 * (Blue Rope Length)

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  This can be represented as:

* Blue Rope Length = Yellow Rope Length - 7

We can now express the total length of the three ropes as:

* Yellow Rope Length + Blue Rope Length + Red Rope Length = 37

Let's substitute the expressions for the blue and red rope lengths into the total length equation:

*  (Yellow Rope Length) + (Yellow Rope Length - 7) + 4 * (Yellow Rope Length - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

* 6 * (Yellow Rope Length) - 28 = 37

Solving for the Yellow Rope Length:

* 6 * (Yellow Rope Length) = 65
* Yellow Rope Length = 65 / 6 = 10.83 (approximately)

Now, we can find the length of the red rope:

* Red Rope Length = 4 * (Yellow Rope Length - 7)
* Red Rope Length = 4 * (10.83 - 7)
* Red Rope Length = 4 * 3.83
* Red Rope Length = 15.32 (approximately)


**Answer:** The length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 centimeters.

* **Rissa's remaining amount:**  After giving to her sister, Rissa had $15 - $3 = $12.
* **Ronnie's initial amount:** Ronnie had $5.
* **Amount given to sister:**  Ronnie gave away the same amount as Rissa, so she gave away $3.
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:**  After giving to her sister, Ronnie had $5 - $3 = $2.

"The problem involves calculating the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  We can approach this by considering the volume of the jar and the volume of the jelly beans.

**1. Volume of the Jar:**

* The jar is a rectangular prism with a base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
* Volume = base * base * height
* Volume = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

**2. Packing Efficiency:**

* The jelly beans are packed with an efficiency of 80%. This means that 80% of the space in the jar is actually occupied by the jelly beans.

**3. Number of Jelly Beans:**

* We know the true number of red jelly beans is 900.
* We can calculate the volume of the jelly beans by multiplying the volume of the jar by the packing efficiency.
* Volume of jelly beans = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches
* We can then calculate the number of jelly beans by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.
* Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans

**4. Difference:**

* The difference between the estimated number of jelly beans and the actual number is 900 - 2880 = -1980. 

**Answer:**  The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number of red jelly beans is -1980.

"The popcorn kernels exhibit a classic popcorn popping pattern.  The initial burst of popping is due to the rapid heating of the kernels.  The rate of popping increases as the temperature rises, reaching a peak in the third 30-second interval.  The rate then decreases as the kernels reach their maximum potential.  The final 30 seconds of popping represent the kernels that have reached their peak potential and are now cooling.  The residual heat will continue to pop kernels for a short period of time.

To determine the total number of kernels, we need to consider the initial burst, the subsequent increases, and the final burst.

* **Initial burst:** 20 kernels
* **Second burst:** 60 kernels
* **Third burst:** 240 kernels
* **Final burst:** 120 kernels
* **Residual heat:** 30 kernels

**Total kernels:** 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = **440 kernels**

"The tower's composition is straightforward: 4 blue blocks, twice the number of yellow blocks, and an unknown number of red blocks.  To determine the number of red blocks, we can use the following equation:

Total blocks = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks

We know the total number of blocks is 32.  Let's substitute the known values:

32 = 4 + 8 + Red blocks

Solving for the unknown number of red blocks:

32 = 12 + Red blocks
Red blocks = 32 - 12
Red blocks = 20

Therefore, there are **20** red blocks in the tower.

"The boat's value depreciates linearly, so we can calculate the depreciation for each year.  

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:**  $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is calculated as follows:

(Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can represent their ages as:

* Mia's age = x
* Emma's age = x + 16

Substituting these values into the average formula:

(x + (x + 16)) / 2 = 48

Simplifying the equation:

(2x + 16) / 2 = 48

Further simplifying:

x + 8 = 48

Solving for x:

x = 40

Therefore, Emma's age is:

Emma's age = x + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56

The average of their ages is:

(40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to consider the total number of cookies made and the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies.  

The Adams family has 7995 total cookies, with 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies: 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2225. 

Therefore, the Adams family has made **2225** chocolate chip cookies.

"Igor's error in item count is likely due to a simple miscalculation.  Let's break down the problem:

* **Test Tubes:** Igor gathered 8 test tubes, which is half the requested 16.
* **Petri Dishes:** He gathered 16 Petri dishes, which is the requested number.
* **Total Items:**  The total number of items on the bench is 29.

To determine the number of beakers lost, we can use the following equation:

Total Items = Test Tubes + Petri Dishes + Beakers - Beakers Lost

We know the total number of items is 29.  We also know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.  Let's substitute these values into the equation:

29 = 8 + 16 + Beakers - Beakers Lost

Solving for the number of beakers lost:

29 = 24 + Beakers - Beakers Lost
5 = Beakers - Beakers Lost

Therefore, Igor lost **5** beakers.

"James is currently 18 years old, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  To find James's age, we can use the following formula:

Age = (Years since birth) * (Age of the child)

Since James was born when John was 19, we can calculate his age by:

Age = (19 - 1) * 2 = 36

Therefore, James is currently 36 years old.

To find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we can use the following formula:

Age = (Years since birth) + 3

Since John's youngest son was born when John was 32, we can calculate his age in 3 years by:

Age = 32 + 3 = 35

Therefore, John's youngest son will be 35 years old in 3 years.

**Answer:** 35

"Mark's car needs a new radiator, and he's found a good deal at a junk yard.  The radiator itself is $400, but he gets it for 80% off, so the price is $400 - (0.80 * $400) = $80.  He then needs to have it installed by a mechanic, and it takes 3 hours at $50 per hour.  The total cost is $80 + ($50/hour * 3 hours) = $80 + $150 = $230. 

**Answer:** $230

"The problem presents a classic animal population scenario.  Let's break it down:

* **Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of cows.**

We know:

* **c + w = 20** (The total number of animals is 20)
* **2c + 4w = 70** (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

To solve for the number of chickens, we can use a system of equations.  

**Solving for 'w' in the first equation:**
* w = 20 - c

**Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:**
* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

**Simplifying and solving for 'c':**
* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5

**Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.**
