"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We have clues about where people live and what they like.  Let's see if we can figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
* **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
* **Clue 8:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 9:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 10:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
* **Clue 12:** The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
* **Clue 14:** The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 16:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
* **Clue 17:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 18:** The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.

**Let's think about it:**

We need to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.  We can use the clues to figure out where everyone else lives.

"Let's figure out where the bird keeper lives!

We know the baseball player is in the second house.  We also know the basketball player isn't in the first house.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 7:** The bird keeper doesn't live in the third house.

Let's look at the houses and see if we can figure out where the bird keeper lives.

"Let's figure this out!

* We know the person who likes red lives in the second house.
* We also know the mystery book reader lives in a different house than the person who likes red.

So, the mystery book reader must live in one of the other houses.

* The fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the first house.
* The person who likes white doesn't live in the third house.

This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house. 


**Answer:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **(A) 3**. 
"
"Let's figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives!

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 5:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses.

"Let's figure out where the person who only drinks water lives!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
* **Clue 1:** The golfer doesn't live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 2:** The violinist doesn't live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house.

We can start by figuring out where the golfer and violinist live. 

Let's look at the clues that tell us about the people who live in the houses. 

* **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 6:** The flutist lives to the right of the person wearing boots.
* **Clue 7:** The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.
* **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
* **Clue 10:** The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.
* **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives to the right of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, we can use these clues to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

"Let's break down the clues to find out where the person who likes white lives!

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.  Since the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

Now, the person who likes apples lives to the left of the person who is eating oranges.  This means the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

T |  |  |  |  
L |  |  |  |  
C |  |  |  |  
R |  |  |  |  
D |  |  |  |  
```

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

* **Clue 1:** The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with the phone.
* **Clue 2:** The person with the phone lives to the left of the person with the television.
* **Clue 4:** The person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio.
* **Clue 5:** The person with daffodils does not live in the fourth house.

We can figure out the order of the houses and the location of the person with the carnations arrangement.

"Let's figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The pianist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

We can make a little chart to help us:

```
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
-------|---|---|---|---|
  P |  |  |  |  
  S |  |  |  |  
  F |  |  |  |  
  P |  |  |  |  
  Y |  |  |  |  
```

Now, let's see if we can figure out where the other people live.

"Let's figure out where the pizza eater lives!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
* **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

We can draw a little picture to help us:

```
House | Shoes | Lunch | Book | Car
-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
1     |  |  |  |  
2     |  |  |  |  
3     |  |  |  |  
4     |  |  |  |  
```

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the grid.

Let's look at the clues and see if we can figure out the rest!

"Let's figure out where the percussionist lives!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The flutist lives in the second house.
* **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

We can start by making a little chart to keep track of the information. 

```
House |  Drink  | Instrument | Food | Color
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1     |  |  |  |  
2     |  |  |  |  
3     |  |  |  |  
4     |  |  |  |  
5     |  |  |  |  
```

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the chart. 

* **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
* **Clue 3:** The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
* **Clue 9:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 11:** The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives.
* **Clue 13:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 15:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Now, let's look for patterns and see if we can figure out where the percussionist lives.

"Let's figure out where the person who likes white lives!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow.

Let's think about the houses and the clues:

* **House 1:**  We don't know anything about this person.
* **House 2:** We know the person who likes green doesn't live here, and the person who had stew doesn't live here.
* **House 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives here.

* **Clue 2:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

**Thinking it through:**

* We know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.
* We also know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. 
* Since the person who likes yellow is to the left of the person wearing sandals, and the person who only drinks water is to the left of the person wearing high heels, we can deduce that the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who likes yellow.

**The answer:**

The person wearing sandals lives in house 2.

"Let's break down the clues to find out where the kiwi eater lives!

* **Clue 2:**  The person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The person who drinks tea lives to the left of the person with a television.

We know that the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes are next to each other.  This means they are either on the same side of the houses or next to each other.

Now, we know the person who drinks tea lives to the left of the person with a television.  This means the person with a television is to the right of the person who drinks tea.

We also know that the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals. 

Putting it all together, we can figure out the kiwi eater's house. 



**Answer:**  The kiwi eater lives in house **1**.

* House 3: W (Water drinker)

The guitarist must be in house 2. 


**Answer: (A) 2**

**So, the horse person must be in one of the other houses!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know this is a bit of a puzzle, but we can solve it step-by-step.

* **Clue 1:** The person who eats oranges lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.

This is a good start!  

Now, let's think about the other clues.  We know the person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible.  

Let's make a little chart to help us:

| House | Person | Pet | Car | Fruit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | O |  |  |  |
| 2 | ? |  |  |  |
| 3 | H |  |  |  |

We also know that the person who eats mangos doesn't live in the third house.  

We also know that the person who eats mangos and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other.

**So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.**


**Answer: (A) 2**

"Let's figure out where the person who owns horses lives!

We know this:

* The guitarist and root beer lover live next to each other.
* The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
* The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

Let's use this to make a little chart:

```
     |  House 1  | House 2  
-------|-----------|---------
   |  Guitarist  |  Root Beer Lover
   |  Cellist   |  Cat Lover
   |  Mystery Book Reader |  History Book Buff
```

We can figure out where the cat lover and mystery book reader live. 

The mystery book reader lives in house 2 because the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. 

The cat lover lives in house 1 because the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. 

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 1. 



**Answer:**  House 1

* **Clue 1:** The person with the carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
* **Clue 2:** The dog owner doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person with the tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

We can figure out the order of the houses!

*  The carnations person is to the right of the bird keeper, so the bird keeper is in house 1.
*  The dog owner is not in the second house, so the dog owner is in house 1.
*  The person with the tulips is to the right of the dog owner, so the tulips person is in house 3. 


**Answer:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in **(C) 3**.

So, the bird keeper must be in house 3! 


**Answer: (D) 3**

3. Bird keeper

The romance book lover lives in house 2. 


**Answer:** (B) 2

We know the person who likes red lives in the second house. We also know the person who likes white lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes must be in the house to the right of the person who likes white. 

We can now deduce the order of the houses based on the clues.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the bird keeper lives in the second house.  We also know the person with lilies lives to the left of the violinist.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Clue 3** tells us the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
* **Clue 4** tells us there's one house between the violinist and the person with a rose bouquet.
* **Clue 5** tells us the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 6** tells us the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
* **Clue 7** tells us the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the guitarist.
* **Clue 8** tells us the bird keeper lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 9** tells us the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 10** tells us the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

Let's put it all together!

"Let's break down the clues to find out where the science fiction book fanatic lives!

* **Clue 1:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

**Thinking it through:**

Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the person with the computer is to the right of the person with the phone, the person with the phone must be in house 2.

The mystery book reader is to the left of the person who has a television, so the person with the television must be in house 3.

The science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3.


**Answer:** 3

"No, someone with St. Vitus's Dance would not likely win a ballet competition. 

Here's why:

* St. Vitus's Dance is a really hard thing to deal with. It makes people's bodies move in a way they don't want to. 
* Ballet is all about being really graceful and moving your body in a very specific way.  It takes a lot of practice and control.  Someone with St. Vitus's Dance would have a really hard time doing all the fancy moves.

"Pig Latin is a fun word game, so it's not impossible for pigs to use it!  

Here's why:

* **Pig Latin is just a way to change the order of words.**  It's like a silly code. 
* **Pigs don't talk like humans.** They use sounds and body language to communicate. 

So, while pigs can't really ""speak"" Pig Latin, they could probably figure out how to play it! 
 
**Answer:**  (A) No

"Ringo Starr is a vegetarian.  So he would probably not eat the pot roast. 

**Answer:** (A) 
"
"No, the 1936 Summer Olympics stadium was big enough for a Super Bowl crowd! 

Here's why:

* The Olympics stadium was really big, it could hold about 100,000 people.
* Super Bowl games are really big too, and they can have even more people than that! 


So, even though the Olympics stadium was smaller than some Super Bowls, it was still big enough to hold a lot of people. 
"
"Yes, brown rockfish are found in the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis!  They like to live in rocky areas, and the islands have lots of those. 
"
"Seedless cucumbers are a good choice for people who are scared of bugs! 

Here's why:

* **Regular cucumbers** need bees or other bugs to help them make seeds.  
* **Seedless cucumbers** don't need those bugs to make seeds. They are made in a special way in a lab. 


So, if you're worried about bugs, seedless cucumbers are a good option! 

**Answer:** (A) Yes 
"
"Yes, he would run out of theses in half a year. 

Here's why:

* Martin Luther posted 95 theses.
* A year has 365 days. 
 
So, if he posted one thesis a day, he would run out of them in 365 days. 
"
"Waltz is not more safe than slam dance.  Slam dance is more likely to cause injuries because it's a very energetic dance with lots of jumping and spinning. 

Here's why:

* **Waltz:**  It's a slower dance with more controlled movements.
* **Slam dance:** It's fast-paced and involves a lot of jumping and spinning. 


So, slam dance is more likely to cause injuries. 
"
"No, a 1943-S penny would not be good for making silverware.  

Here's why:

* **Silverware is made from silver or sterling silver.**  These are much more valuable and strong than pennies. 
* **Pennies are made of copper-nickel.**  They are not as valuable or durable as silver. 


So, a penny wouldn't be a good choice for making silverware. 
"
"Venus is super hot! It's like a giant oven.  The temperature is so high, it would melt anything, even your snowboard!  And the air is super thick and made of poisonous stuff.  So, no way you could snowboard on Venus.

"Charlemagne's dad, Pepin the Short, was a really important king for the Franks, but he wasn't around for the Battle of Tours.  

The Battle of Tours happened in 732 AD.  Pepin died in 768 AD.  So, he couldn't have been there! 


**Answer:**  (B) No

"No, Hermes and Vulcan are not the same. 

They are both gods, but they have different jobs. Hermes is the messenger god in Greek mythology, and he's known for his speed and his winged sandals. Vulcan is the Roman god of fire and metalworking. 

So, they are different! 


"
"Ariana Grande has talked about having anxiety and panic attacks.  Those are things that can be related to PTSD. PTSD is a serious condition that can happen after someone has been through a really scary or upsetting event.  So yes, Ariana Grande could be a good example to talk about PTSD.

"Jack Black is a really funny actor and singer, but Bear McCreary is a famous composer.  He makes music for movies and shows like ""God of War"" and ""The Walking Dead.""  So, I think it's pretty unlikely Jack Black would win an award for music like Bear McCreary does. 

Here's why:

* **Bear McCreary is really good at making music for movies and shows.**  He's like a music superhero!
* **Jack Black is good at acting and singing, but not as much at making music.** 


So, the answer is **(B) Yes**.

"Bob got The Odyssey because he traded with Eve. 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob traded books.
* Alice and Dave traded books.
* Alice and Claire traded books.
* Bob and Eve traded books.
* Alice and Dave traded books. 



So, Bob got The Odyssey. 

The answer is (B). 
"
"Let's figure out who has which book at the end!

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Lolita
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Catch-22
    * Eve: Ulysses

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they switch books.  So, Claire gets Dave's book and Dave gets Claire's book. 
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  They switch books.

**So, at the end, Dave has Catch-22.** 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap their balls, so Alice gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Alice's orange ball.
* **Eve and Alice:**  They swap their balls, so Alice gets Eve's white ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.
* **Bob and Dave:**  They swap their balls, so Dave gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap their balls again, so Alice gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Alice's white ball.
* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap their balls, so Bob gets Claire's red ball and Claire gets Bob's white ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the blue ball. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about how the books get traded!

First, Eve and Dave swap books. Then, Claire and Eve swap books. Then, Dave and Bob swap books. Then, Eve and Alice swap books. Finally, Bob and Claire swap books. 

So, who has the book at the end?  Let's look at the list of books they all have:

* Eve: Catch-22
* Dave: Ulysses
* Bob: Moby Dick
* Claire: The Odyssey
* Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles

The answer is **(C) Moby Dick**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets a black ball, Dave gets a blue ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets a blue ball, Eve gets a black ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets a black ball, Eve gets a blue ball.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets a blue ball, Dave gets a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets a blue ball, Bob gets an orange ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the blue ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Bob got The Odyssey! 

Here's why:

*  The trades happen in a circle.  
*  We know that Dave and Bob swap books. 
*  Bob started with The Odyssey. 



So the answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Dave is in the center, Bob is on the right, Claire is on the right wing, Alice is on the bench, and Eve is on the left wing.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the center.

* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice moves to the right wing, and Claire moves to the center.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the right wing.

* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob moves to the center, and Claire moves to the right wing.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the center.

**So, at the end of the game, Dave is playing left wing!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Claire is playing Left Winger! 

Here's why:

*  Eve and Claire switched places.
*  Alice and Dave switched places.
*  Bob and Eve switched places.
*  Dave and Bob switched places.
*  Bob and Eve switched places again. 



 
"
"Dave is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance! 

Here's why:

* **Step 1:**  Dave starts with Rodrigo.
* **Step 2:**  Alice and Bob switch partners.
* **Step 3:**  Dave and Alice switch partners.
* **Step 4:**  Dave and Claire switch partners.
* **Step 5:**  Bob and Claire switch partners. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

So, at the end of the game, everyone has swapped their balls.  This means that Alice has the green ball. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Claire gets Ulysses! 

Here's why:

*  They all trade books, and we know that Claire and Bob swap books at the end. 
*  This means that Claire ends up with the book that Bob and Claire swapped. 


So the answer is (E). 
"
"Eve ends up with the brown ball. 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap their balls, so they end up with each other's colors.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's ball.

"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Bob is the benchwarmer, Alice is the right winger, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the goalkeeper, and Eve is the cheerleader.

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch places.  Bob becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.

* **Trade 2:** Dave and Claire switch places. Dave becomes the right midfielder, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 3:** Alice and Claire switch places. Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right winger.

* **Trade 4:** Eve and Alice switch places. Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 5:** Dave and Bob switch places. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

**So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing goalkeeper.**

*  Claire and Dave swap books, then Dave and Alice swap books, and so on. 
*  The last trade is Claire and Eve swapping books. 


So, Claire ends up with Ulysses. 


**Answer: (E) Ulysses** 
"
"Claire is dancing with Izzi! 

Here's why:

* **Step 1:**  Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Step 2:** Dave and Alice switch partners.
* **Step 3:** Dave and Bob switch partners.
* **Step 4:** Alice and Eve switch partners.
* **Step 5:** Eve and Claire switch partners. 



 
"
"Let's think about the swaps! 

Here's what we know:

* **Alice** started with purple.
* **Bob** started with white.
* **Claire** started with brown.
* **Dave** started with red.
* **Eve** started with yellow.

We don't know what they swapped, but we know that they swapped gifts. 

**So, we can't figure out the final gift.** 

**The answer is (None of the above)** 



"
"Let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Sam, and Claire is with Bob. 

Then Bob and Eve switch partners, so Bob is now with Eve, and Eve is with Sam.

Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Melissa.

Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa.

Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is with Bob.

So, Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color Claire ends up with! 

Here's how the gifts swap:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change the color of their gifts.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This doesn't change the color of their gifts.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the color of their gifts.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the color of their gifts.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the color of their gifts.

So, Claire starts with a black ball. 


**Answer: (E) black ball** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about how the books get traded!

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve and Claire switch books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve switch books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire and Dave switch books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve switch books again.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice and Bob switch books.

So, at the end, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Let's figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end!

We know that Bob and Claire switched partners, then Alice and Dave switched partners, and then Bob and Alice switched partners again.  

Then, Claire and Eve switched partners, and finally, Eve and Alice switched partners. 

So, Eve is dancing with **Ophelia** at the end.

"Okay, so we have to figure out what Claire has at the end! 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's pink ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
2. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's orange ball, Dave gets Bob's pink ball.
3. Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Eve's brown present.
4. Bob and Alice swap: Bob gets Alice's red present, Alice gets Bob's pink ball.
5. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Dave's orange ball.

So, Claire ends up with the black ball! 

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Eve is playing Left Midfielder at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as a right winger.
*  Claire and Eve switched positions, then Claire and Dave switched positions. 
*  Eve and Claire switched positions again.
*  Claire and Alice switched positions.
*  Finally, Bob and Dave switched positions. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a brown ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a blue ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball.

So, Dave ends up with the green ball. 


**The answer is (C).**

"Eve is playing Left Midfielder at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as Left Midfielder.
*  Then, Eve and Bob switched positions.

"Eve got Lolita! 

Here's why:

* Eve started with The Odyssey.
* Bob and Alice traded, so Bob got The Pearl and Alice got Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Claire and Dave traded, so Claire got Lolita and Dave got Moby Dick.
* Eve and Dave traded, so Eve got Moby Dick and Dave got Lolita.
* Bob and Dave traded again, so Bob got Lolita and Dave got Moby Dick.

"Eve ends up with the green ball! 

Here's why:

* Alice gives Eve her black ball.
* Dave and Claire swap balls.
* Dave gives Eve his yellow ball.
* Claire gives Eve her orange ball.
* Bob gives Eve her green ball. 


So Eve has the green ball. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Let's think about how the balls are swapped!

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

So, after all the swaps, Bob has the purple ball. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball, and Claire gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets the blue ball, and Bob gets the red ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Eve gets the black ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gets the red ball, and Bob gets the brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the black ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the blue ball. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Bob gets Ulysses! 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets Frankenstein, and Eve gets Ulysses.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Dave gets Frankenstein, and Bob gets Ulysses.

"Okay, so let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Frankenstein*, Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets *The Great Gatsby* and Alice gets *Ulysses*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets *Frankenstein* and Alice gets *Ulysses*.

* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Dave gets *Ulysses*.

**So, at the end of the semester, Bob has *Frankenstein*.** 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Claire has Ulysses! 

Here's why:

*  They trade books in a circle.
*  The trades happen in a round-robin fashion. 
*  The last trade is between Alice and Eve. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Alice starts as a fullback.  Then, Bob switches places with Alice.  Then, Dave switches places with Bob.  Then, Alice switches places with Claire.  Then, Bob switches places with Claire.  Finally, Alice switches places with Eve. 

So, Alice is playing right winger at the end of the match. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Claire got Lolita! 

Here's why:

*  Claire and Alice traded books first.  
*  Then Dave and Alice traded books.
*  Eve and Bob traded books.
*  Dave and Bob traded books.
*  Finally, Bob and Claire traded books. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the dance moves:

* **Start:**  Bob is with Rodrigo, Claire is with Patrick, Dave is with Izzi, Alice is with Jamie, and Eve is with Melissa.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave is now with Izzi, and Eve is now with Bob.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Melissa, and Claire is now with Rodrigo.
* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, and Eve is now with Claire.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire is now with Rodrigo, and Alice is now with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is with Izzi. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a purple ball, and Dave starts with a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a green ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

So, at the end, Dave has the yellow ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  

Here's how it works:

* **Start:**  Alice has yellow, Bob has red, Claire has green, Dave has orange, and Eve has black.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they switch their gifts.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch their gifts again.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave is with Rodrigo, and Eve is with Melissa.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice is with Bob, and Claire is with Dave.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice is with Patrick, and Eve is with Dave.

So, Dave is now with **Patrick**! 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that the gifts are being swapped around.  

* Dave and Eve swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
* Eve and Claire swap, so Claire gets Eve's present and Eve gets Claire's present.
* Dave and Bob swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's present.
* Claire and Bob swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
* Dave and Alice swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.

So, the final gift is the one that Dave had.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), Alice gets Eve's book (Frankenstein).
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Eve's book (Frankenstein), Eve gets Bob's book (Moby Dick).
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), Dave gets Claire's book (The Fellowship of the Ring).

So, Dave started with The Odyssey and then traded with Claire.  The final book Dave has is The Fellowship of the Ring. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

First, Claire and Alice swap their gifts.  That means Claire gets the red present and Alice gets the pink ball.

Then, Claire and Dave swap.  This means Claire gets the orange ball and Dave gets the pink ball.

Then, Alice and Bob swap.  This means Alice gets the black ball and Bob gets the red present.

Finally, Eve and Dave swap.  This means Eve gets the orange ball and Dave gets the brown present.

And then, Bob and Claire swap.  This means Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the orange ball.

So, the final gift is the **pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* **Alice and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets the yellow and Alice gets the green.
* **Bob and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets the orange and Bob gets the purple.
* **Bob and Eve:**  They swap gifts again, so Eve gets the green and Bob gets the orange.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets the red and Claire gets the green.
* **Dave and Alice:**  They swap gifts, so Alice gets the orange and Dave gets the purple.

So, Dave ends up with the green present. 

The answer is **(B)**.

"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **First swap:** Bob and Dave swap.  This means Bob's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Bob's.
* **Second swap:** Alice and Dave swap.  This means Alice's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Alice's.
* **Third swap:** Eve and Claire swap.  This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's.
* **Fourth swap:** Alice and Bob swap.  This means Alice's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Alice's.
* **Fifth swap:** Dave and Claire swap.  This means Dave's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Dave's.

So, the final gift is Claire's present.  The answer is **(D) brown present.**

* **First:**  Alice and Claire switch partners.
* **Second:** Dave and Eve switch partners.
* **Third:** Alice and Claire switch partners again.

* **Eve and Dave switch partners:** This means Eve and Dave switch partners.
* **Eve and Claire switch partners:** This means Eve and Claire switch partners. 



So, Bob is dancing with Ophelia. 


The answer is **(A)**.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave is now the fullback, and Claire is now the striker.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve is now on the left wing, and Dave is now the striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob is now the benchwarmer, and Alice is now the center midfielder.

So, Bob is now the benchwarmer. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Eve ends up with the brown ball! 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire swap their balls.
* Alice and Dave swap their balls.
* Dave and Claire swap their balls.
* Claire and Bob swap their balls.
* Bob and Eve swap their balls. 


Let me know if you have any other word puzzles! 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.

So, the last person to have a ball is Dave. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  

Let's think about it like this:

* **Start:**  Alice has green, Bob has blue, Claire has red, Dave has yellow, and Eve has purple.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  So now Claire has the green, and Alice has the red.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Now Bob has the red, and Eve has the blue.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Now Alice has the blue, and Dave has the red.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Now Bob has the red, and Dave has the blue.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Now Dave has the blue, and Eve has the red.

So, Dave ends up with the blue present! 


**The answer is (C) blue present.** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the game!

Alice and Eve swap balls, then Dave and Claire swap, and so on.  

The important thing is that Eve gets all the balls that were originally held by the other players.  

So, at the end, Eve has all the balls! 

The answer is **(B) red ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Bob's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice's ball becomes Claire's, and Claire's ball becomes Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire's ball becomes Bob's, and Bob's ball becomes Claire's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's ball becomes Dave's, and Dave's ball becomes Claire's.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the **green ball**.

"Eve ends up with the orange ball! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Eve starts with a brown ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has the orange ball, and Dave has the brown ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave now has the brown ball, and Alice has the orange ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the orange ball, and Claire has the brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the brown ball, and Claire has the orange ball. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

We know that Claire and Bob switched partners, then Claire and Eve switched partners, and then Bob and Dave switched partners.  

The last step is Claire and Eve switching partners again.  

So, Bob is now dancing with Izzi. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that Bob started with a black ball.  Here's how the swaps work:

* Eve and Alice swap gifts.
* Claire and Bob swap gifts.
* Alice and Bob swap gifts.
* Alice and Eve swap gifts.
* Dave and Bob swap gifts.

The important thing is that Bob gets to keep the gift he started with. 


So the answer is **(C) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Claire swap, so Eve gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Eve's red ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's red ball and Eve gets Alice's blue ball.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's red ball and Claire gets Bob's blue ball.
* Dave and Alice swap, so Dave gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Dave's red ball.

So, at the end, Dave has the blue ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the right midfielder, and Eve is the left midfielder.

* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to the left midfielder, and Alice moves to the right midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve moves to the right midfielder, and Bob moves to the left winger.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to the right midfielder, and Dave moves to the left winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice moves to the left winger, and Eve moves to the right midfielder.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to the fullback, and Bob moves to the left winger.

**So, Claire is now playing right midfielder!** 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's think about this like a game of tag!  

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.

"Okay, so we have Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve.  They're doing a white elephant gift exchange, and they're all trading gifts.  

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Brown
    * Bob: Black
    * Claire: Green
    * Dave: Purple
    * Eve: Yellow

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.  
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** They switch gifts.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** They switch gifts.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** They switch gifts.

So, after all the swapping, who has the purple present? 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Claire is the one who changes positions the most!  Let's see how it goes:

* **Start:** Claire is the striker.
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire is now the right winger.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire is now the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Claire is now the striker.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire is now the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob is now the left midfielder.

So, Claire is the goalkeeper! 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Eve and Dave swap balls first.  Then Alice and Dave swap.  Then Alice and Claire swap.  Then Dave and Bob swap.  Finally, Eve and Dave swap again. 

The last swap is Eve and Dave.  So, Eve has the orange ball. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Eve got Catch-22! 

Here's why:

*  Eve and Dave swapped books. 
*  Dave got Lolita, so Eve got Catch-22. 



**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance.

"Claire gets Ulysses! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Claire swap books:**  Bob gets The Odyssey, Claire gets Ulysses. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Eve got Catch-22! 

Here's why:

*  They all trade books, and we know Eve got Catch-22 to start. 
*  The book trading happens in a circle, so Eve gets the book she started with.

"Let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

First, Dave and Alice switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then Bob and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Sam. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Dave is a left winger.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes a left winger.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes the left winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Dave is playing **left winger**. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave starts with purple, Bob starts with black. They swap, so Bob now has purple and Dave has black.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice starts with red, Dave starts with black. They swap, so Dave now has red and Alice has black.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob starts with black, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve now has black and Bob has green.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with purple, Claire starts with yellow. They swap, so Claire now has purple and Dave has yellow.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with red, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve now has red and Alice has green.

So, Bob ends up with the green present. 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Dave's white present.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets Eve's orange ball and Eve gets Dave's black ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Eve's orange ball and Claire gets Alice's black ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets Alice's green present and Alice gets Eve's black ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets Alice's green present and Dave gets Bob's orange ball.

So, Dave ends up with the orange ball! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's think about how the books get traded!

1. **Start:**  Bob has Frankenstein, Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire has Ulysses, Alice has The Pearl, and Eve has Moby Dick.

2. **Bob and Dave swap:**  They switch books, so Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave gets Frankenstein.

3. **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets Ulysses, and Claire gets Frankenstein.

4. **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets Ulysses, and Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

5. **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Moby Dick, and Bob gets Ulysses.

6. **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice gets Moby Dick, and Eve gets Ulysses.

**So, Bob has Ulysses at the end!** 


**Answer: (E)**

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap gifts.  This means the colors are now mixed up.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap gifts.  Again, the colors are mixed up.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap gifts.  The colors are mixed up.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap gifts.  The colors are mixed up.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap gifts.  The colors are mixed up.

We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are mixed up.  

**So, we can't figure out what Dave has!** 



 
"
"Let's figure out who has the book at the end!

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they switch books.  So now:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch books again.  So now:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books.  So now:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch books.  So now:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

**So, Dave ends up with Ulysses!** 


**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color Claire has at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice's pink ball goes to Dave's orange ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave's orange ball goes to Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Alice's pink ball goes to Dave's orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob's red present goes to Claire's green present.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob's red present goes to Eve's black ball.

So, the final gift is the one that was originally Eve's.  That means Claire has the **black ball**. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap gifts, so the green present goes to Bob and the white present goes to Alice.
* **Alice and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so the white present goes to Alice and the yellow present goes to Eve.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap gifts, so the yellow present goes to Claire and the black ball goes to Eve.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap gifts, so the orange ball goes to Alice and the green present goes to Dave.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap gifts, so the yellow present goes to Bob and the white present goes to Eve.

So, at the end, Claire has the yellow present. 


**The answer is (D).**

"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Claire and Alice switched partners a few times.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire-Lola, Alice-Ophelia
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve-Ophelia, Alice-Lola
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire-Jamie, Dave-Lola

The last step is important!  We know that Dave and Bob switched partners. 

So, the final dance partner for Alice is Lola. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* Claire and Dave swap: This means Claire starts with a purple ball, and Dave starts with a red ball.
* Dave and Alice swap: This means Dave starts with a red ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* Bob and Claire swap: This means Bob starts with a red ball, and Claire starts with a purple ball.
* Dave and Claire swap: This means Dave starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a red ball.
* Bob and Eve swap: This means Bob starts with a red ball, and Eve starts with a purple ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the red ball. 


**Answer: (D)**

"Here's how the books get traded around:

1. **Start:**
   * Alice: The Odyssey
   * Bob: Frankenstein
   * Claire: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Dave: Moby Dick
   * Eve: Lolita

2. **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets Moby Dick, and Dave gets Frankenstein.

4. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire gets Lolita.

5. **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Lolita, and Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

**So, at the end of the semester, Claire has Hound of the Baskervilles.**

"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's white ball and Dave gets Alice's orange ball.

* Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets Bob's pink ball and Bob gets Dave's black ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's red ball and Eve gets Alice's white ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the red ball.

"Eve ends up with the red ball! 

Here's why:

* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice gives Dave her purple ball, and Dave gives Alice his yellow ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gives Eve his yellow ball, and Eve gives Dave his brown ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gives Dave his black ball, and Dave gives Bob his yellow ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her red ball, and Claire gives Dave his yellow ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gives Eve her red ball. 



 
"
"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

* Eve and Alice switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Claire and Eve switch partners.
* Claire and Alice switch partners.

This means that after the first round, Eve and Alice switch partners, and then Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners. 

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Eve. 


The answer is **(A) Ophelia**. 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Dave is the fullback, Bob is the striker, Claire is the benchwarmer, Alice is the right winger, and Eve is the left midfielder.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, Bob becomes the fullback.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, Eve becomes the striker.

* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, Bob becomes the striker.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, Claire becomes the left midfielder.

* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the left midfielder.

**So, Dave is now the left midfielder!** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* Alice and Dave swap, so Dave gets Alice's pink ball and Alice gets Dave's purple ball.
* Claire and Eve swap, so Eve gets Claire's red ball and Claire gets Eve's yellow ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, so Bob gets Alice's pink ball and Alice gets Bob's white ball.
* Dave and Claire swap, so Claire gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Claire's purple ball.
* Alice and Claire swap, so Claire gets Alice's pink ball and Alice gets Claire's red ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball. 


**Answer: (E) pink ball.** 
"
"Bob ends up dancing with Izzi! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice switch:**  This means Alice now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Claire now dances with Izzi. 
 
Let me know if you have any other dance questions! 
"
"Eve is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* Eve and Alice switched partners first.
* Dave and Claire switched partners next.

"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Eve gives Alice her pink ball, and Alice gives Eve her green present.
* Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave gives Bob his red present, and Bob gives Dave his orange ball.
* Claire and Dave swap gifts. Claire gives Dave his red present, and Dave gives Claire her white present.
* Eve and Claire swap gifts. Eve gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gives Eve her white present.
* Bob and Dave swap gifts. Bob gives Dave his orange ball, and Dave gives Bob his red present.

So, at the end, Alice has the green present. 


**Answer:** (E) green present. 
"
"Let's figure out what book Alice has at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Alice starts with ""The Great Gatsby"".**
2. **Alice and Bob swap books.**  This means Bob now has ""The Great Gatsby"".
3. **Eve and Bob swap books.**  Eve now has ""The Great Gatsby"".
4. **Bob and Claire swap books.**  Bob now has ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
5. **Alice and Claire swap books.**  Alice now has ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
6. **Dave and Claire swap books.**  Dave now has ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".

**So, at the end of the semester, Alice has ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".** 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's look at the dance moves:

1. Eve and Claire switch partners.
2. Bob and Eve switch partners.
3. Dave and Bob switch partners.
4. Alice and Bob switch partners.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners.

We can see that Dave ends up dancing with Melissa. 

So the answer is (A). 
"
"Eve ends up with Izzi! 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire is now with Sam, Bob is with Izzi.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is now with Izzi, Eve is with Sam.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob is now with Melissa, Dave is with Izzi.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is now with Izzi, Eve is with Melissa.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Eve is now with Izzi. 



So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* Alice starts with Helga.
* Then, Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Then, Alice and Dave switch partners.
* Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.
* Finally, Eve and Bob switch partners.

This means that Alice has switched partners with everyone else.  So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Helga. 


The answer is **(E) Helga.** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the left midfielder, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the striker.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the striker.

* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.

* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

"Okay, so let's look at the dance moves:

* **Start:**  Bob is with Lola, Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Patrick, Eve is with Jamie, and Alice is with Izzi.
* **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Sam, and Eve is with Alice.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave is now with Izzi, and Alice is with Sam.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire is now with Patrick, and Dave is with Sam.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire is now with Lola, and Alice is with Jamie.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is with Lola. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Eve is dancing with Bob at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(B) Karl**. 



"
"Eve ends up with the white ball. 

Here's why:

* Eve and Alice swap their balls. 
* Dave and Bob swap their balls.
* Claire and Alice swap their balls.
* Alice and Dave swap their balls.
* Eve and Alice swap their balls. 


Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets blue, Claire gets yellow.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets green, Dave gets brown.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets yellow, Alice gets blue.
* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets blue, Bob gets yellow.

Now, we know that Dave started with the green ball.  Since he swapped with Bob, and Bob swapped with Dave, Dave must have the green ball at the end. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice trade:**  Bob moves to the right winger position, and Alice moves to the bench.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave moves to the right winger position, and Claire moves to the goalkeeper position.
* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice moves to the goalkeeper position, and Claire moves to the right winger position.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve moves to the right winger position, and Alice moves to the cheerleader position.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave moves to the bench, and Bob moves to the goalkeeper position. 



 
"
"Let's look at the dance moves:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Alice and Bob switch partners.
3. Dave and Eve switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means that Dave and Eve switch partners, then Eve and Claire switch partners, and then Alice and Claire switch partners. 

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with **Alice**. 



"
"Okay, so let's see who has what book at the end!

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets Frankenstein, and Eve gets Ulysses.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets Ulysses, and Dave gets Moby Dick.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Moby Dick, and Bob gets The Pearl.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets The Pearl, and Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve gets The Pearl.

So, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades!

First, Claire and Dave swap books.  That means they switch their books.  Then Alice and Eve swap books.  Then Bob and Eve swap books.  Then Dave and Bob swap books.  Finally, Alice and Dave swap books again. 

So, let's look at the end.  Bob has to have the book that was traded the most.  

* **Bob: Frankenstein** 



"
"Let's think about the trades!

First, Claire and Eve swap books.  Then Alice and Bob swap books.  Then Bob and Eve swap books.  Then Eve and Alice swap books.  Finally, Bob and Dave swap books. 

So, Dave ends up with the book that Bob and Dave swapped.  

The answer is **(B) Lolita**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire swap.  This means Bob gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Bob's brown ball.
* **Second swap:** Claire and Eve swap. This means Claire gets Eve's brown ball and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Third swap:** Alice and Dave swap. This means Alice gets Dave's yellow ball and Dave gets Alice's red ball.
* **Fourth swap:** Bob and Alice swap. This means Bob gets Alice's red ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball.
* **Fifth swap:** Dave and Bob swap. This means Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's yellow ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the yellow ball. 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Eve is dancing with Karl at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Dave switch partners:**  This means Claire is now dancing with Sam, and Dave is now dancing with Lola.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has yellow, Dave has pink, and Eve has green.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts one last time.

So, after all the swapping, who has the gift?  

**The answer is (E) green.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave now has Claire's gift.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means Dave now has Bob's gift.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire now has Eve's gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve now has Alice's gift.

So, Dave ends up with the gift that was originally Claire's. 

**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"Eve ends up with the blue ball! 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Eve gets Dave's green ball, and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets Claire's blue ball, and Claire gets Bob's ball.

"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a yellow ball, Alice starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the yellow ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a white ball, Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the white ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob has the orange ball, Dave has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob has the blue ball, Alice has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire has the red ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the red ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave starts with a pink ball, Alice starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Dave gets the brown ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice has the pink ball, Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire has the pink ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve has the white ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Eve gets the blue ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice has the orange ball, Dave has the pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the white ball. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

* **Alice and Claire switch partners:**  This means they swap partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch:**  They swap partners again.
* **Dave and Bob switch:**  They swap partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch:**  They swap partners again.
* **Dave and Eve switch:**  They swap partners.

So, after all the switching, Alice is dancing with **Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

First, we know that Claire and Alice switched partners. Then, Alice and Dave switched partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then, Bob and Eve switched partners. Finally, Dave and Bob switched partners. 

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Eve. 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

First, Claire and Alice swap.  That means Claire gets the brown present and Alice gets the orange ball.

Then, Dave and Bob swap.  This means Dave gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red present.

Then, Dave and Claire swap again.  This means Dave gets the red present and Claire gets the orange ball.

Then, Claire and Alice swap again.  This means Claire gets the red present and Alice gets the orange ball.

Finally, Eve and Alice swap.  This means Eve gets the orange ball and Alice gets the black ball.

So, Dave has the **orange ball**.

"Bob is dancing with Izzi at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Bob switch:**  This means they swap partners.
* **Eve and Bob switch:**  This means they swap partners. 
 
Let me know if you have any other dance questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is the goalie, Bob is the striker, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the midfielder, and Eve is the right midfielder.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the midfielder, Dave becomes the right midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, Bob becomes the midfielder.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, Claire becomes the midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, Bob becomes the midfielder.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Bob becomes the goalie, Alice becomes the striker.

So, Bob ends up playing the goalie! 


The answer is **(C)**.

"Claire got Catch-22 to start.  Then Eve and Claire traded books.  Alice and Bob traded books.  Dave and Alice traded books.  Bob and Dave traded books.  Eve and Bob traded books. 

So, Claire has Catch-22. 



**Answer: (B) Catch-22** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *Frankenstein*, and Eve has *The Great Gatsby*.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Bob's book (Catch-22), Alice gets Eve's book (The Great Gatsby).
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's book (Catch-22), Bob gets Alice's book (Lolita).
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's book (Catch-22), Bob gets Claire's book (The Pearl).
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Dave's book (Frankenstein), Dave gets Eve's book (The Great Gatsby).
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's book (The Pearl), Claire gets Bob's book (Catch-22).

So, at the end, Claire has *The Pearl*. 


**Answer: (C)**

"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Alice and Eve switch places.  Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve becomes the striker.
2. Alice and Claire switch places. Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the striker.
3. Dave and Bob switch places. Dave becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the benchwarmer.
4. Alice and Dave switch places. Alice becomes the benchwarmer, and Dave becomes the striker.
5. Dave and Eve switch places. Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Dave is playing goalkeeper. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end!

We know Eve and Alice switched partners first. Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Claire and Eve switched partners again.  Then Bob and Alice switched partners. Finally, Bob and Dave switched partners. 

So, the last dance is Dave and Claire. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

1. **Dave and Alice switch:**  Dave now dances with Lola, Alice now dances with Karl.
2. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire now dances with Melissa, Dave now dances with Helga.
3. **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice now dances with Sam, Dave now dances with Helga.
4. **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob now dances with Melissa, Eve now dances with Sam.
5. **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob now dances with Helga, Alice now dances with Sam.

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Sam! 


**Answer: (A)**

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Claire becomes the right winger.

"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the right midfielder, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the striker, and Eve is the left winger.

* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve becomes the cheerleader, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the striker, and Dave becomes the left winger.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing the striker! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end!

We know that Claire and Dave switched partners, then Eve and Bob switched partners, and then Claire and Alice switched partners.  

Finally, Eve and Alice switched partners.  

So, Dave is now dancing with Sam. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  

Let's think about it like this:

* **Start:** Alice has green, Bob has blue, Claire has red, Dave has yellow, and Eve has purple.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  So now Claire has the green, and Alice has the red.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Now Bob has the red, and Eve has the green.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Now Alice has the blue, and Dave has the red.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Now Bob has the red, and Dave has the blue.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Now Dave has the blue, and Eve has the red.

So, Eve ends up with the red present! 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Eve ends up with the black ball! 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets an orange ball and Claire gets a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets a blue ball and Bob gets a red ball.

"Eve is playing right winger! 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as a left midfielder.
*  Then, Eve and Bob switched positions.
*  Eve then switched with Bob again. 
*  Finally, Alice and Claire switched positions. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets the white present and Alice gets the purple present.
* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets the yellow present and Claire gets the white present.
* **Dave and Eve:**  Dave now has the white present, and Eve has the pink ball. They swap, so Eve gets the white present and Dave gets the pink ball.
* **Bob and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets the green present and Bob gets the white present.
* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap gifts, so Claire gets the green present and Dave gets the white present.

So, at the end, Eve has the white present! 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the dance moves:

* **First:** Alice is with Melissa, Bob is with Sam, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Patrick, and Eve is with Jamie.
* **Then:** Bob and Dave switch partners.
* **Next:** Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **After that:** Eve and Dave switch partners.
* **Finally:** Claire and Alice switch partners.

So, the last step is Dave and Alice switch partners. 

**Answer: (B) Sam** 



"
"Claire is playing Right Midfielder! 

Here's why:

*  The trades happened in a specific order. 
*  We know that Claire started as a right winger and then moved to left winger. 
*  Then, she moved to right midfielder. 



Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch books.  We don't know who got which book.

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books.  We don't know who got which book.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they switch books.  We don't know who got which book.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means they switch books.  We don't know who got which book.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they switch books.  We don't know who got which book.


**The only way to figure out who has which book is to look at the final order.**

"Bob has Ulysses! 

Here's why:

*  They trade books in a circle.
*  The last trade is Claire and Eve swapping books. 
*  This means that Bob has the book that Eve had at the beginning. 


So the answer is (E). 
"
"Eve gets the pink ball! 

Here's why:

* Eve and Alice swap their gifts.
* Dave and Bob swap their gifts.
* Claire and Dave swap their gifts.
* Eve and Claire swap their gifts.
* Bob and Dave swap their gifts. 


So, Eve ends up with the pink ball. 


The answer is (C).

"Let's look at the dance moves:

1. **Bob and Eve switch partners:**  This means Bob now dances with Ophelia, and Eve dances with Bob.
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners:**  This means Alice now dances with Bob, and Bob dances with Alice.
3. **Dave and Alice switch partners:**  This means Dave now dances with Claire, and Alice dances with Dave.
4. **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Claire dances with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Claire. 


**Answer: (C) Claire** 
"
"Let's think about the dance moves!

* **First:** Dave is with Jamie.
* **Then:** Claire and Alice switch partners.
* **Next:** Eve and Alice switch partners.
* **After that:** Claire and Dave switch partners.
* **Finally:** Dave and Bob switch partners.

So, the last step is Dave and Bob switch partners.  

**Therefore, Dave is dancing with Bob.** 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has yellow, Claire has green, Dave has pink, and Eve has white.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire gets Dave's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Dave's present.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Bob's present.

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Eve's present.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.

**So, the final gift Alice has is the one she got from Dave!** 



**Answer:** (C) pink ball. 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with a brown ball, and Claire starts with a red ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve starts with a red ball, and Alice starts with a green ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with a red ball, and Bob starts with a green ball.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire starts with a green ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the green ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is the cheerleader, Bob is the benchwarmer, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the fullback, and Eve is the right midfielder.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes the right winger, Dave becomes the fullback.

So, Bob is now the right winger! 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Eve ends up with the blue present! 

Here's why:

* **Eve gets the blue present from Bob:**  Bob and Eve swap gifts. 
* **Eve gets the blue present from Dave:** Dave and Eve swap gifts. 


So the answer is (A). 
"
"Claire is now playing right winger! 

Here's why:

*  We know Claire started as the center midfielder.
*  Alice and Bob switched positions.
*  Dave and Bob switched positions.

* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gives Alice her pink ball, Alice gives Eve her green present.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave gives Bob his red present, Bob gives Dave his orange ball.
* Claire and Dave swap: Claire gives Dave his white present, Dave gives Claire her red present.
* Eve and Claire swap: Eve gives Claire her green present, Claire gives Eve her white present.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gives Dave his orange ball, Dave gives Bob his red present.

Now, let's look at the gifts at the end. Dave has the red present. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Claire starts as the goalkeeper.  Then, she switches places with Eve, who becomes the goalkeeper.  Then, Claire switches places with Dave, who becomes the striker.  Then, Alice switches places with Claire, who becomes the striker.  Finally, Dave switches places with Claire, who becomes the left winger. 

So, Claire is now playing the right winger. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's think about the trades!

* **Eve and Dave start:** Eve gets Dave's book, The Great Gatsby, and Dave gets Eve's book, Lolita.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Eve's book, The Great Gatsby, and Eve gets Bob's book, Lolita.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets Bob's book, Ulysses, and Eve gets Claire's book, The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Claire's book, Ulysses, and Eve gets Alice's book, The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets Dave's book, The Great Gatsby, and Dave gets Alice's book, The Odyssey.

So, Dave ends up with The Great Gatsby! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's look at the dance moves:

* **Start:** Dave is with Rodrigo.
* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire with Melissa, Bob with Jamie.
* **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire with Alice, Eve with Dave.
* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire with Alice, Bob with Eve.
* **Eve and Dave switch:**  Eve with Rodrigo, Dave with Alice.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Alice. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* **Step 1:**  Dave and Eve switch partners.
* **Step 2:** Bob and Claire switch partners.
* **Step 3:** Bob and Eve switch partners.
* **Step 4:** Claire and Alice switch partners.
* **Step 5:** Claire and Bob switch partners. 


Let me know if you have any other dance questions!

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **First Swap:** Claire and Bob swap.  
* **Second Swap:** Bob and Dave swap.
* **Third Swap:** Eve and Claire swap.
* **Fourth Swap:** Bob and Alice swap.
* **Fifth Swap:** Dave and Claire swap.

Now, we need to figure out who has the brown present at the end.  

The answer is **(A) brown present**. 



"
"Claire switches partners with Eve, then Dave and Alice switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners again.  Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners.  So, Claire is dancing with Patrick. 

The answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the goalkeeper, Bob is the striker, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the right midfielder.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve moves to the center midfielder spot, and Dave moves to the right midfielder spot.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the center midfielder.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

**So, at the end of the match, Bob is the center midfielder.** 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Alice starts as a fullback.**
* **Claire and Eve switch places.**  Claire becomes a right winger, and Eve becomes a cheerleader.
* **Bob and Claire switch places.** Bob becomes a cheerleader, and Claire becomes a right midfielder.
* **Bob and Dave switch places.** Bob becomes a right winger, and Dave becomes a center midfielder.
* **Alice and Claire switch places.** Alice becomes a right midfielder, and Claire becomes a right winger.
* **Claire and Eve switch places.** Claire becomes a center midfielder, and Eve becomes a right winger.

"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* Alice and Dave switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Alice and Eve switch partners.
* Bob and Dave switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.

This means that after each switch, the person who was dancing with the person who switched partners, now dances with the person who was originally with the person who switched partners. 

So, after the last switch, Alice is dancing with Karl. 


The answer is **(C) Karl.** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire gets Dave's white ball and Dave gets Claire's yellow ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice gets Eve's yellow ball and Eve gets Alice's black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice gets Eve's black ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's yellow ball and Eve gets Claire's black ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the yellow ball. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's see who has what book at the end!

* **Alice starts with:** Lolita
* **Bob starts with:** The Great Gatsby
* **Claire starts with:** Ulysses
* **Dave starts with:** The Fellowship of the Ring
* **Eve starts with:** The Odyssey

They trade books a few times, but we need to figure out who gets what at the end. 

Let's look at the trades:

1. Bob and Alice swap books.  This means Bob gets Ulysses and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.
2. Eve and Claire swap books. This means Eve gets The Fellowship of the Ring and Claire gets The Odyssey.
3. Alice and Bob swap books. This means Alice gets The Odyssey and Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
4. Dave and Eve swap books. This means Dave gets Ulysses and Eve gets The Great Gatsby.
5. Claire and Eve swap books. This means Claire gets The Great Gatsby and Eve gets Ulysses.

So, at the end, Alice has The Odyssey! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap gifts, so Alice gets Bob's white present.
* **Alice and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets Alice's green present.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets Claire's black ball.
* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets Alice's green present.
* **Bob and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Bob gets Eve's yellow present.

So, the final gift Alice has is the white present. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's look at the dance changes:

1. **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means Bob is now with Izzi, and Claire is now with Dave.
2. **Eve and Dave switch partners:** This means Eve is now with Patrick, and Dave is now with Helga.
3. **Bob and Dave switch partners:** This means Bob is now with Eve, and Dave is now with Helga.
4. **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means Alice is now with Dave, and Bob is now with Helga.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Helga. 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Let's think about the trades!

* Alice and Dave swap books.  
* Dave and Claire swap books.
* Alice and Bob swap books.
* Dave and Claire swap books.
* Eve and Alice swap books.

This means that Alice got the book she didn't get at the beginning. 


So the answer is **(E) Catch-22**. 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's green ball and Claire gets Bob's brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets Eve's red ball and Eve gets Dave's white ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice gets Eve's red ball and Eve gets Alice's blue ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets Claire's green ball and Claire gets Dave's white ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets Dave's brown ball and Dave gets Bob's white ball.

So, Dave ends up with the brown ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is the right midfielder, Bob is the benchwarmer, Claire is the goalkeeper, Dave is the left winger, and Eve is the center midfielder.

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve moves to the left midfielder spot, and Alice moves to the center midfielder spot.

* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes the center midfielder, and Alice becomes the left winger.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice moves to the left winger spot, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire moves to the left winger spot.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire moves to the left winger spot.

**So, Bob is now the goalkeeper!** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as a left midfielder.
*  Alice and Eve switched positions.
*  Claire and Bob switched positions.

"Alice starts as the goalkeeper.  Then, she switches places with Claire, who becomes the goalkeeper.  Then, Alice switches places with Bob, who becomes the goalkeeper.  Then, Dave and Bob switch places.  Finally, Dave and Eve switch places.  So, Alice is now playing center midfielder. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

So, at the end of the game, Dave has the orange ball. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's see who has what book at the end!

* **Start:** Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets *Lolita* and Alice gets *The Great Gatsby*.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *The Odyssey*.

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets *The Great Gatsby* and Bob gets *Lolita*.

* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets *The Odyssey* and Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets *The Odyssey* and Eve gets *Ulysses*.

**So, at the end, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring!** 


**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Eve ends up with the blue ball! 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice his pink ball, Alice gives Dave his brown ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her brown ball, Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, Bob gives Claire her blue ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gives Bob his blue ball, Bob gives Eve her blue ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice gives Dave his brown ball, Dave gives Alice her pink ball. 



Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves!

* Dave and Bob switch partners.  This means Dave is now with Ophelia.
* Then, Claire and Dave switch partners. This means Claire is now with Rodrigo.
* Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. This means Eve is now with Dave.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Eve. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve starts as the benchwarmer.  Then, Alice and Bob switch places.  Then, Dave and Bob switch places.  Then, Alice and Eve switch places.  Finally, Dave and Claire switch places.  

So, Eve ends up playing striker! 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve.  They all start with a different color gift.  

Here's what happens:

1. Bob and Dave swap gifts.
2. Eve and Bob swap gifts.
3. Bob and Dave swap gifts again.
4. Eve and Alice swap gifts.
5. Claire and Eve swap gifts.

The final gift Alice has is the orange ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are all playing a game where they swap gifts.  

* **First swap:** Alice and Claire swap their gifts.
* **Second swap:** Bob and Alice swap their gifts.
* **Third swap:** Eve and Alice swap their gifts.
* **Fourth swap:** Claire and Dave swap their gifts.
* **Fifth swap:** Eve and Claire swap their gifts.

The important thing is that we need to figure out who has the blue present at the end. 

**So the answer is (B).** 



"
"Let's look at the dance changes:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Dave and Alice switch partners.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.

"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is the striker, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the benchwarmer.

* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire moves to fullback, and Bob moves to left winger.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave moves to left winger, and Claire moves to center midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to fullback, and Bob moves to striker.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve moves to center midfielder, and Dave moves to benchwarmer.

* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice moves to center midfielder, and Dave moves to striker.

**So, Bob is now playing striker!** 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about who has what book at the end!

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Bob gets Frankenstein.**
* **Claire gets Ulysses.**
* **Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles.**
* **Eve gets Moby Dick.**

Now, let's see how the trades work:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles, and Dave gets Frankenstein.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Ulysses, and Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Moby Dick, and Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Frankenstein, and Bob gets Moby Dick.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Moby Dick, and Eve gets Frankenstein.

So, at the end, Alice has **Frankenstein**! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has yellow, Dave has pink, and Eve has green.

2. **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch their presents.  So now Claire has purple and Alice has yellow.

3. **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch again.  So now Bob has yellow and Claire has purple.

4. **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch, so now Alice has pink and Dave has purple.

5. **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch, so now Dave has green and Eve has pink.

6. **Alice and Bob swap:**  Finally, they switch, and Bob ends up with the green present. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob starts with an orange ball, Eve starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Eve now has an orange ball and Bob has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has an orange ball, Dave now has a brown ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave now has a brown ball, Alice now has a green ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has a green ball, Claire now has a brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has a brown ball, Claire now has a green ball.

So, Dave ends up with the green ball! 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as the striker.
*  Bob and Dave switched positions.
*  Alice and Eve switched positions.
*  Claire and Dave switched positions.
*  Claire and Bob switched positions.
*  Eve and Bob switched positions. 



 
"
"Let's look at the dance moves:

1. **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  Dave now dances with Jamie, Eve now dances with Dave.
2. **Alice and Claire switch partners:** Alice now dances with Rodrigo, Claire now dances with Dave.
3. **Dave and Bob switch partners:** Dave now dances with Melissa, Bob now dances with Eve.
4. **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice now dances with Rodrigo, Eve now dances with Dave.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Melissa. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

Here's how we know:

1. Eve and Claire swap books.
2. Bob and Eve swap books.
3. Claire and Dave swap books.
4. Bob and Eve swap books.
5. Alice and Bob swap books. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so we have Eve, Claire, Bob, Dave, and Alice.  Let's think about how the gifts are swapped.

* Eve and Claire swap their gifts.
* Claire and Bob swap their gifts.
* Bob and Alice swap their gifts.
* Eve and Alice swap their gifts.
* Bob and Dave swap their gifts.

The last swap is between Bob and Dave.  So, the final gift Bob has is the color that was in the last swap, which is the green present. 

**Answer: (E) green present.** 



"
"Eve has Ulysses! 

Here's why:

* Alice gave Eve her book. 
*  Eve got the book from Alice. 


So the answer is (B). 
"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo! 

Here's why:

*  We know that Dave and Bob switched partners.
*  Then Claire and Dave switched partners.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Start:** Alice is purple, Bob is brown, Claire is green, Dave is red, and Eve has a pink ball.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  We don't know who has what after this.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  We don't know who has what after this.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  We don't know who has what after this.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  We don't know who has what after this.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  We don't know who has what after this.

**So, we can't figure out who has what after all the swaps!** 



 
"
"Eve is dancing with Helga at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Alice switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:** This changes Eve's partner.

"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Bob swap, so Eve gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Eve's green ball.
* Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets Claire's brown ball and Claire gets Dave's red ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's blue ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.
* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's yellow ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the blue ball. 


**Answer: (E) blue ball** 
"
"Let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

* **Start:** Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Karl, Alice is with Lola, Bob is with Melissa, and Eve is with Helga.
* **Dave and Alice switch:**  Dave now dances with Lola, and Alice dances with Karl.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire now dances with Karl, and Dave dances with Helga.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice now dances with Helga, and Dave dances with Lola.
* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob now dances with Melissa, and Eve now dances with Sam.

So, Claire is now dancing with **Karl**. 


The answer is **(B)**.

"Eve ends up with Rodrigo because they switched partners at the very end! 

The answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Let's think about the swaps! 

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes the colors again.

So, Bob ends up with the color that was originally with Eve. 


The answer is **(E) blue present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, we know Alice starts with a white present. Then, Dave gets the purple present from Alice.  

Next, Claire and Dave swap gifts.  

Then, Dave and Eve swap gifts. 

Finally, Bob and Dave swap gifts. 

So, the final gift is the purple present. 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Dave starts with a green ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

So, Bob ends up with the brown ball! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

So, at the end of the game, everyone has a new ball. 


**Therefore, the answer is (E) yellow ball.** 
"
"Alice gets the purple ball! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets Green, Claire gets Purple
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Purple, Bob gets Green
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Green, Bob gets Purple
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Blue, Alice gets Purple

"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap their balls, so Dave gets Alice's white ball and Alice gets Dave's orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap their balls, so Claire gets Bob's black ball and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap their balls, so Dave gets Claire's orange ball and Claire gets Dave's pink ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap their balls, so Bob gets Dave's orange ball and Dave gets Bob's black ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap their balls, so Eve gets Alice's white ball and Alice gets Eve's red ball.

So, at the end of the game, Dave has the red ball. 

**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Dave switch partners.
* Claire and Eve switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.

This means that Bob is dancing with someone new after Eve and Bob switch partners. 


So the answer is **(B) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Eve ends up with the red ball! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets a red ball and Dave gets a white ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Alice gets a white ball and Dave gets a pink ball.

"Okay, so we have Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve.  Let's think about how the gifts change hands.

* **First Swap:** Bob and Claire swap.  This doesn't change anything.
* **Second Swap:** Eve and Alice swap.  This changes the colors.
* **Third Swap:** Bob and Claire swap again.  This changes the colors again.
* **Fourth Swap:** Claire and Dave swap.  This changes the colors again.
* **Fifth Swap:** Eve and Dave swap.  This changes the colors again.

So, the final gift Alice has is the purple present. 

**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Alice gets the orange ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Alice gets the purple present.
* Claire and Eve swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.

So, Claire ends up with the purple present. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is on the outside, Claire is the goalie, Dave is on the left, and Eve is on the right.

* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve moves to the left, and Claire moves to the right.

* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice moves to the left, and Dave moves to the center.

* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the right, and Bob moves to the center.

So the answer is (A). 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire starts with a black ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with a black ball, and Bob starts with a pink ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with a black ball.

So, at the end of the game, Dave has the black ball. 

**Answer: (D)**

"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the fullback, Bob is the benchwarmer, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the left midfielder, Eve is the right winger, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the goalkeeper.

* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes the left winger, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes the left winger, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes the right winger, Bob becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the right winger, Eve becomes the left winger.

So, Alice is now playing the **left winger**! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Eve ends up with the white present! 

Here's why:

* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Eve gets Alice's pink gift.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets Fred's orange gift.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets Bob's yellow gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's red gift.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's purple gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's white gift. 



So, Eve has the white present! 


 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

* Eve and Bob switch places.  Eve becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the left winger.
* Fred and Claire switch places. Fred becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* Bob and Fred switch places again. Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Fred becomes the left winger.
* Bob and Claire switch places again. Bob becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* Eve and Alice switch places. Eve becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* Dave and Gertrude switch places. Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Gertrude becomes the striker.

So, Bob is now the left winger. 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Eve ends up with the orange ball! 

Here's why:

* **The swaps:**  We need to look at the swaps to figure out who gets what ball. 
* **The final result:** Eve and Claire swap, and Eve ends up with the orange ball. 


So the answer is (E). 
"
"Gertrude ends up playing striker! 

Here's why:

* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes Fullback, Bob becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Striker
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper
* **Dave and Fred trade:** Dave becomes Cheerleader, Fred becomes Left Midfielder
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes Striker, Eve becomes Center Midfielder
* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred becomes Center Midfielder, Gertrude becomes Striker 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives her ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives her ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives her ball to Gertrude.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives her ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives his ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives his ball to Fred.

We can see that Alice ends up with the ball that was originally held by Gertrude. 


**Therefore, the answer is (F) purple ball.** 
"
"Fred is now dancing with Izzi! 

Here's why:

*  The dance partners switch partners in a pattern. 
*  Fred and Izzi switched partners. 



The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Dave and Eve switched partners, then Gertrude and Fred switched partners, and then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Dave and Eve switched partners again. 

This means that Alice and Rodrigo switched partners. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's think about the gift exchange! 

We know that each person swaps gifts with someone else.  The important thing is to remember that the color of the gift doesn't matter.  

So, we need to figure out what happens to the gifts after each swap.  

* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's gift is now Eve's, and Eve's gift is now Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's gift is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's gift is now Claire's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Eve's gift is now Fred's, and Fred's gift is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's gift is now Bob's, and Bob's gift is now Fred's.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's gift is now Bob's, and Bob's gift is now Fred's.

* **Eve and Bob:** They switch books again.
* **Eve and Dave:** They switch books.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** They switch books.

* Bob and Gertrude swap.
* Dave and Bob swap.
* Eve and Gertrude swap.
* Bob and Alice swap.
* Eve and Fred swap.
* Claire and Dave swap.
* Gertrude and Fred swap.

The last person to swap is Fred.  Fred ends up with the blue ball. 

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Let's break down the game!

Eve and Dave swap balls a few times, so they're probably getting a new ball each time.  Then, Eve and Fred swap, and then Eve and Dave swap again.  This means Eve and Dave are getting a new ball each time they swap.  

Finally, Alice and Dave swap.  

So, Eve ends up with the ball that was originally held by Dave. 


The answer is **(C) red ball**.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has blue, Claire has brown, Dave has orange, Eve has white, Fred has pink, and Gertrude has yellow.

* **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  They switch presents.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  They switch presents again.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  They switch presents.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  They switch presents.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  They switch presents again.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  They switch presents.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  They switch presents one last time.

Now, the important thing is that we don't change the color of the present.  So, Eve ends up with the yellow present. 

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Dave is dancing with!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Dave is with Rodrigo.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve and Claire switch partners.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve and Bob switch partners.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve and Alice switch partners.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave and Bob switch partners.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave and Eve switch partners.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice and Dave switch partners.

So, after all the switching, Dave is now with Rodrigo. 


**Answer: (C) Rodrigo** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the green ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Eve and Dave swap balls.
* Gertrude and Eve swap balls.
* Bob and Fred swap balls.
* Claire and Fred swap balls.
* Alice and Claire swap balls.
* Eve and Fred swap balls.
* Eve and Dave swap balls.

We can see that Eve and Dave swap balls a few times, and then Eve and Fred swap balls a few times.  This means that Eve and Dave are likely to have swapped balls with each other.  

So, the final ball distribution is:

* Alice: **Green ball**
* Bob: **Brown ball**
* Claire: **Orange ball**
* Dave: **Red ball**

"Bob is playing striker! 

Here's why:

*  We know Bob started in the center midfielder position.
*  Bob then traded with Eve, who became the right midfielder. 
*  Bob then traded with Eve again, and Eve became the striker. 



Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:**  This means Eve is now with Fred, and Gertrude is now with Rodrigo.
* **Fred and Dave switch partners:** Fred is now with Alice, and Dave is now with Ophelia.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice is now with Dave, and Bob is now with Claire.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch partners:** Gertrude is now with Claire, and Bob is now with Eve.
* **Alice and Claire switch partners:** Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is now with Rodrigo.
* **Dave and Alice switch partners:** Dave is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Rodrigo.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude is now with Rodrigo, and Claire is now with Melissa.

So, Claire is now dancing with Melissa! 


The answer is (A). 
"
"Gertrude switches partners a few times, but the key is to remember who she was with at the start.  She started with Sam, then switched with Alice, then with Dave, then with Fred, then with Eve, and finally with Claire.  

So, at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with Claire. 

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it like this:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a green present, Bob has a blue one, and so on.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Bob's.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Claire's present and Claire gets Alice's.

Now, the important part is to remember that each person gets a new present after each swap.  So, after all the swaps, Alice will have the present that was originally with Claire. 


**So the answer is (A) red present.** 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what Fred has at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob gets a white present, Alice gets a black present.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets a blue present, Fred gets a green present.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gets an orange present, Eve gets a white present.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets a brown present, Claire gets a green present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gets a black present, Bob gets a blue present.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets an orange present, Eve gets a green present.

Fred started with a green present and then got an orange present from Eve.  So Fred's present is now an **orange ball**. 


**Answer:** (E) 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Fred and Bob swap balls.
* Eve and Fred swap balls.
* Dave and Eve swap balls.
* Alice and Bob swap balls.
* Dave and Fred swap balls.
* Bob and Claire swap balls.
* Gertrude and Alice swap balls.

Notice that the last trade is between Gertrude and Alice.  This means that Gertrude ends up with the ball that Alice had. 

So the answer is **(B) blue ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's figure out who has what.

Here's how it works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** They swap gifts.
2. **Alice and Bob:** They swap gifts.
3. **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap gifts.
4. **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap gifts.
5. **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap gifts.
6. **Alice and Claire:** They swap gifts.
7. **Claire and Bob:** They swap gifts.

So, let's think about who has what after all the swaps. 

* **Bob:**  He started with a pink ball. 
* **Gertrude:** She started with a yellow present. 
* **Dave:** He started with a black ball. 
* **Eve:** She started with a purple present.

"Fred is playing fullback at the end of the match.  

Here's why:

*  The trades happened in a specific order. 
*  Fred started as a fullback and then Alice and Fred switched positions. 



The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the ball!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire gets the orange ball, and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets the orange ball, and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets the pink ball, and Claire gets the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred gets the pink ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Fred has the **brown ball**. 



"
"Let's think about the swaps! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve ends up with a red ball, Dave ends up with a blue ball, and Fred ends up with a blue ball. 

Then, Alice and Bob swap balls, and Gertrude and Claire swap balls.  This means Alice ends up with a green ball, Bob ends up with a purple ball, and Claire ends up with a pink ball. 

Finally, Alice and Dave swap balls. This means Dave ends up with a purple ball. 

So, Fred has the **(B) white ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what book Alice has at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Fred and Alice:** They traded books, so Alice got Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They also traded books, so Eve got Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Eve:** They traded books again, so Eve got Alice's book.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They traded books, so Gertrude got Dave's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They traded books, so Claire got Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Claire:** They traded books again, so Claire got Alice's book.
* **Dave and Bob:** They traded books, so Bob got Dave's book.

So, Alice has the book that was traded with everyone else. 



**The answer is (E) Catch-22.** 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of friends who like to read!  Let's figure out who has which book at the end.

Here's how we know:

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Fred got Eve's book, and Eve got Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This means Gertrude got Alice's book, and Alice got Gertrude's book.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave got Claire's book, and Claire got Dave's book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice got Bob's book, and Bob got Alice's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:**  This means Alice got Fred's book, and Fred got Alice's book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Eve got Dave's book, and Dave got Eve's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve got Alice's book, and Alice got Eve's book.

So, we can figure out who has which book!

"Okay, so we have to figure out what book Alice has at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave's book is now Gertrude's book, and Gertrude's book is now Dave's book.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Bob's book is now Claire's book, and Claire's book is now Bob's book.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Dave's book is now Alice's book, and Alice's book is now Dave's book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Claire's book is now Fred's book, and Fred's book is now Claire's book.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** This means Fred's book is now Dave's book, and Dave's book is now Fred's book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Claire's book is now Bob's book, and Bob's book is now Claire's book.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Fred's book is now Eve's book, and Eve's book is now Fred's book.

So, we can see that the book that was originally Dave's book is now Alice's book. 



**Therefore, the answer is (C) The Pearl.** 
"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap, so Bob now has a green ball, and Alice has a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap, so Alice now has a blue ball, and Claire has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap, so Bob now has a purple ball, and Fred has a white ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Claire now has a white ball, and Fred has a purple ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so Alice now has a red ball, and Gertrude has a purple ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so Alice now has a blue ball, and Dave has a red ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Dave now has a red ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

**Therefore, Fred has the blue ball.**

"Eve is the goalkeeper at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

* The trades happened in a specific order. 
* We know Eve started as a center midfielder. 
* Bob and Eve traded positions. 
* Bob became the center midfielder. 
* Eve then became the goalkeeper. 



So the answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Alice** starts as the Left Midfielder.
* **Bob** starts as the Benchwarmer.
* **Claire** starts as the Right Midfielder.
* **Dave** starts as the Cheerleader.
* **Eve** starts as the Left Winger.
* **Fred** starts as the Goalkeeper.
* **Gertrude** starts as the Right Winger.

Then, we see some trades happen:

* **Fred and Claire trade positions.**  Fred becomes the Right Winger, and Claire becomes the Left Midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade positions.** Fred becomes the Cheerleader, and Dave becomes the Goalkeeper.
* **Alice and Bob trade positions.** Alice becomes the Benchwarmer, and Bob becomes the Left Midfielder.

* **Dave and Eve trade positions.** Dave becomes the Right Winger, and Eve becomes the Left Winger.
* **Dave and Alice trade positions.** Dave becomes the Left Winger, and Alice becomes the Cheerleader.

So, after all the trades, Bob is now the **Cheerleader**. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Gertrude is playing Left Midfielder at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

*  The positions are swapped a few times, but Gertrude and Alice swap positions twice. 
*  Gertrude ends up in the Left Midfielder position. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve is playing left winger! 

Here's why:

*  We know Eve started as the benchwarmer.
*  Then, she moved to right winger when Dave switched places with her.
*  After that, Alice and Eve switched places. 
*  Finally, Eve ended up in the left winger position. 


So the answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end!

We know that Alice started as a right midfielder.  Then, she and Claire switched places.  Then, Eve and Dave switched places.  Then, Bob and Alice switched places.  Then, Fred and Dave switched places.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switched places.  Finally, Gertrude and Eve switched places.

So, Alice is now playing goalkeeper!

* Fred and Claire swap balls.
* Bob and Fred swap balls.
* Gertrude and Bob swap balls.
* Gertrude and Claire swap balls.

**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Eve has a yellow present, Bob has an orange ball, and so on.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  They switch presents.

"Okay, I can do that!  Let's break down the problem. 

We need to figure out who has the ball after all the trades.  

* **Gertrude** and **Bob** swap balls.
* **Eve** and **Alice** swap balls.
* **Dave** and **Fred** swap balls.
* **Gertrude** and **Alice** swap balls.
* **Alice** and **Claire** swap balls.
* **Bob** and **Eve** swap balls.
* **Claire** and **Dave** swap balls.

So, who has the ball at the end? 


"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Fred is dancing with at the end!

We know that Fred and Helga switched partners, then Alice and Fred switched partners, and then Bob and Eve switched partners.  

The last two partners to switch were Gertrude and Dave. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Ophelia. 


The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

First, Bob and Eve swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Gertrude swap gifts.  Then, Gertrude and Dave swap gifts.  Then, Eve and Fred swap gifts.  Then, Fred and Bob swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Fred and Bob swap gifts.

So, we know Eve got the brown present from Fred. 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the fullback, Eve is the goalkeeper, Fred is the center midfielder, and Gertrude is the benchwarmer.

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Fred becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes the right winger, Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, Alice becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the right winger, Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.

**Final Positions:**

* **Alice:** Goalkeeper

* Fred and Gertrude swap books.
* Fred and Claire swap books.
* Fred and Bob swap books again.
* Dave and Alice swap books. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* **Bob and Gertrude:**  They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Bob's purple.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Dave's orange.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Eve's yellow.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's purple and Bob gets Dave's orange.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Claire's white and Claire gets Dave's orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Fred's brown and Fred gets Alice's blue.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Bob's purple and Bob gets Eve's yellow.

So, Dave ends up with the white present! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's see what happens:

* **Start:** Eve has a black ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:**  Claire's orange ball is swapped for Gertrude's green present.

"Let's think about how the books get traded!

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

So, Claire ends up with The Great Gatsby. 

**The answer is (A).**

"Okay, let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

We know that Dave and Bob switched partners. Then Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then Claire and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Alice and Eve switched partners.  Then Gertrude and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Eve and Fred switched partners. 

The last step is important because it tells us that Bob is now dancing with Helga.

* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets a white ball and Alice gets a pink ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets a purple ball and Eve gets an orange ball.
* Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets a green ball and Gertrude gets a brown ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets a pink ball and Claire gets a brown ball.

Now, let's look at the final positions. Bob has the green ball. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens.

3. Dave and Claire swap balls.
4. Bob and Fred swap balls.
5. Fred and Dave swap balls.
6. Eve and Alice swap balls.

So, at the end, Gertrude has the black ball. 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Let's break down the ball trading!

First, we know that everyone starts with a unique color ball.  Then, we see a series of swaps.  

* Claire and Gertrude swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets a blue ball and Alice gets a white ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap again, so they each get the other's ball.
* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
* Fred and Dave swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
* Claire and Dave swap again, so Claire gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
* Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Eve gets a black ball.

Looking at the final result, Bob has the **yellow ball**. 



"
"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

Here's why:

* Eve starts with Frankenstein.
* Alice and Eve swap books. 
 
Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Fred and Gertrude switched partners, then Claire and Fred switched partners, and then Dave and Alice switched partners.  

The last two switches were Dave and Gertrude, and then Alice and Dave. 

So, Alice is now dancing with Dave! 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who ends up with which ball after all the swaps. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives her blue ball to Alice.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives his green ball to Bob.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives his green ball to Claire.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives her brown ball to Dave.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives her purple ball to Eve.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives her purple ball to Claire.
7. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives her orange ball to Fred.

So, Fred ends up with the green ball. 


**The answer is (E) green ball.** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what ball Alice ends up with! 

Let's look at the swaps:

* Bob and Claire swap.
* Dave and Eve swap.
* Fred and Bob swap.
* Dave and Gertrude swap.
* Fred and Bob swap again.
* Gertrude and Fred swap.
* Alice and Fred swap.

Notice that Fred and Bob swap a few times.  This means that Fred and Bob end up with the same ball.  

The final swap is Alice and Fred.  So, Alice ends up with the purple ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Dave is dancing with!

* **Dave and Claire switch partners:**  This means Dave is now dancing with Melissa.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude is now dancing with Sam.
* **Claire and Eve switch partners:** Eve is now dancing with Rodrigo.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** Gertrude is now dancing with Jamie.
* **Fred and Claire switch partners:** Fred is now dancing with Melissa.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** Bob is now dancing with Helga.
* **Eve and Claire switch partners:** Eve is now dancing with Sam.

So, Dave is dancing with Melissa! 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Dave:**  They swap books, so Dave now has Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap books, so Eve now has Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap books, so Bob now has Gertrude's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap books, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap books, so Claire now has Eve's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** They swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap books, so Alice now has Bob's book.

So, at the end of the semester, Bob has Alice's book. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has what gift at the end! 

Let's think about the swaps:

* Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* Fred and Eve swap, so Fred gets Eve's present and Eve gets Fred's.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, so Claire gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Claire's.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets Eve's present and Eve gets Dave's.
* Alice and Fred swap, so Alice gets Fred's present and Fred gets Alice's.
* Alice and Bob swap, so Alice gets Bob's present and Bob gets Alice's.

So, we know that Fred and Eve got each other's presents.  We also know that Bob and Claire got each other's presents.  And we know that Alice and Bob got each other's presents. 

**Therefore, the answer is (F) red present.** 



"
"Okay, here's how the books get swapped around:

* Alice starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* Alice and Eve swap books, so Eve gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Alice gets *Moby Dick*.
* Bob and Alice swap books, so Bob gets *Ulysses* and Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* Dave and Eve swap books, so Dave gets *Ulysses* and Eve gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* Alice and Fred swap books, so Alice gets *Catch-22* and Fred gets *Ulysses*.
* Gertrude and Eve swap books, so Gertrude gets *Catch-22* and Eve gets *Ulysses*.
* Fred and Claire swap books, so Fred gets *The Pearl* and Claire gets *Catch-22*.

So, at the end of the semester, Alice has *Ulysses*. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so they all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books around.  Let's see who got what at the end!

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave got Gertrude's book, and Gertrude got Dave's book.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Eve got Fred's book, and Fred got Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Bob got Gertrude's book, and Gertrude got Bob's book.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Alice got Claire's book, and Claire got Alice's book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Claire got Eve's book, and Eve got Claire's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Bob got Eve's book, and Eve got Bob's book.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice got Bob's book, and Bob got Alice's book.

So, at the end, Alice has Bob's book! 


**Answer: (B) Frankenstein** 



"
"Let's think about the game! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude swap balls, then Fred and Alice swap, and so on.  This means that the colors are being passed around in a circular pattern.  

Since Bob is the one who ends up with the white ball, the answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's figure out who has the blue present at the end.

Here's how we know:

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This means Fred now has Dave's present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Bob now has Fred's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Gertrude now has Dave's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has Dave's present.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has Dave's present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Claire's present.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Alice now has Dave's present.

So, the final gift Gertrude has is the one that was originally Fred's. 


**Answer:** (F) blue present. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Gertrude swapped balls, so Eve got a blue ball and Gertrude got a black ball. Then Fred and Bob swapped, so Fred got an orange ball and Bob got a yellow ball. Fred and Claire swapped, so Fred got a white ball and Claire got an orange ball.  Then Eve and Fred swapped, so Eve got an orange ball and Fred got a black ball. Fred and Claire swapped again, so Fred got a pink ball and Claire got a white ball. Finally, Alice and Bob swapped, so Alice got a green ball and Bob got an orange ball.  

The last swap was between Dave and Gertrude. Dave got a black ball and Gertrude got a pink ball. 

So, Fred has the black ball. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what Fred has at the end! 

Let's look at the swaps:

* Bob and Eve swap.
* Dave and Eve swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Alice and Fred swap.
* Claire and Bob swap.
* Claire and Eve swap.
* Claire and Gertrude swap.

We know that Fred got a yellow present from Alice and then a yellow present from Dave.  

So, Fred's present is the one that was originally Claire's. 


The answer is **(B) pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  Alice has white, Bob has black, Claire has brown, Dave has blue, Eve has orange, Fred has green, and Gertrude has purple.

* **First Swap:** Bob and Alice swap.  That means Bob's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Bob's.

* **Second Swap:** Dave and Fred swap.  That means Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.

* **Third Swap:** Alice and Gertrude swap.  That means Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.

* **Fourth Swap:** Alice and Eve swap.  That means Alice's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Alice's.

* **Fifth Swap:** Bob and Claire swap.  That means Bob's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Bob's.

* **Sixth Swap:** Dave and Bob swap.  That means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.

* **Seventh Swap:** Fred and Eve swap.  That means Fred's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Fred's.

**The final gift is the one that was originally Fred's.** 

**So, the answer is (D) the green present.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Eve starts with a white ball and Gertrude starts with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Bob has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has a purple ball, and Dave has a pink ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred now has a brown ball, and Claire has a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Gertrude has a white ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Alice now has an orange ball, and Fred has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Dave now has a pink ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

So, Claire has the **black ball**. 


**Answer: (C)**

"Alice starts as the benchwarmer.  Then Bob switches places with Alice.  Then Dave and Eve switch places.  Gertrude and Eve switch places.  Fred and Bob switch places.  Claire and Fred switch places.  Gertrude and Alice switch places.  Finally, Dave and Fred switch places.  So, Alice is the striker! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Claire got The Fellowship of the Ring! 

Here's why:

*  The problem tells us that Claire and Gertrude swapped books. 
*  Then, Alice and Claire swapped books. 
*  The final swap was between Alice and Gertrude. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out where Bob is at the end!

* **Start:** Bob is the right midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:**  Gertrude becomes the right winger, Bob becomes the right midfielder.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the striker, Claire becomes the center midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the striker.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes the right winger, Alice becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the right midfielder, Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes the striker, Alice becomes the right winger.

So, Bob is now the **fullback**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Left Winger, Alice becomes Cheerleader
* **Alice and Fred trade:** Alice becomes Left Winger, Fred becomes Cheerleader
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes Goalkeeper, Gertrude becomes Left Winger
* **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob becomes Cheerleader, Eve becomes Left Winger
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes Striker, Bob becomes Left Winger
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Left Winger
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Left Winger

So, Bob is now playing Left Winger! 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Fred and Eve switched partners, then Bob and Dave switched partners, and so on.  This means that the partners keep switching back and forth.  

The last switch was between Gertrude and Fred, and then Bob and Dave switched partners.  

So, the final answer is **(A) Sam**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what book Dave has at the end! 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude gets The Pearl.
2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Claire gets The Great Gatsby, Eve gets Moby Dick.
3. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, Gertrude gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Gertrude gets Moby Dick.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Alice gets The Pearl.
6. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Catch-22, Bob gets The Pearl.

So, Dave ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's figure out who Dave is dancing with!

We know that Dave started with Karl.  Then, Fred and Alice switched partners.  

After that, Gertrude and Eve switched partners.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switched partners.  

Finally, Claire and Bob switched partners.  

So, Dave is now dancing with someone who was originally with Fred. 


The answer is **(D) Helga**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Fred and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Fred and Eve now have each other's gifts.
* **Bob and Gertrude:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Bob and Gertrude now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Claire:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Claire now have each other's gifts.
* **Dave and Fred:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Fred now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Fred:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Fred now have each other's gifts.
* **Dave and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Eve now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Eve now have each other's gifts.

**So, we can't figure out who has what!** 



 
"
"Eve is dancing with Sam at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know that Bob and Eve switched partners. 
* Then, Claire and Eve switched partners. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's figure out who has the white present.

Here's how we know:

* **Fred starts with a white present.**
* **Bob and Fred swap gifts.**  This means Fred now has Bob's present.
* **Fred and Bob swap gifts.**  This means Fred now has Bob's present.

So, Fred has the **yellow** present!

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice and Fred swap:**  Alice gives Fred her blue ball, and Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, and Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

So, at the end, Fred has the **white ball**. 



 
"
"Fred got Ulysses! 

Here's why:

*  Fred got Ulysses at the very beginning of the semester. 
*  The last swap was between Alice and Fred. 



So the answer is (F). 
"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

So, after all the swaps, Bob has the pink ball. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out where Bob is at the end!

We know that Bob started as a cheerleader.  Then, he and Claire switched places.  Then, Bob and Fred switched places.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switched places.  Then, Eve and Alice switched places.  Finally, Eve and Dave switched places. 

So, the last position Bob is in is Center Midfielder. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that the dancers switch partners a few times.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:**  This means they switch places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means they switch places.
* **Eve and Dave switch partners:** This means they switch places.

So, we can see that Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Eve and Dave switch partners.  

**Therefore, Alice is now dancing with Claire.**

"Gertrude is dancing with Dave at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know that Fred and Bob switch partners.
* Then Alice and Eve switch partners.
* Then Alice and Gertrude switch partners.
* Then Bob and Gertrude switch partners.
* Then Fred and Alice switch partners.
* Then Fred and Claire switch partners.
* Finally, Dave and Bob switch partners. 



Let me know if you have any other dance puzzles! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Dave is dancing with!

We know that Dave and Helga switched partners.  We also know that Bob and Eve switched partners.  

So, the final answer is **(D) Helga**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about how this works.

* **First, we need to know what they swapped.**  We don't know what they swapped, so we can't figure out what Dave has. 

* **We can't figure out what they swapped because we don't know what they swapped.** 



Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **The Swaps:**  We need to figure out who ends up with which ball after all the swaps.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The final ball:**  Gertrude ends up with the pink ball. 


**Answer:** (G) 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  Alice has pink, Bob has blue, Claire has orange, Dave has yellow, Eve has white, Fred has brown, and Gertrude has red.

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Fred's present and Fred gets Eve's present. 
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Alice's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Alice's present and Alice gets Dave's present.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Fred's present and Fred gets Alice's present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Eve's present and Eve gets Alice's present.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets Fred's present and Fred gets Claire's present.

So, after all the swaps, Alice has the **(E) pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with presents, and they're swapping them!  

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:**  We know everyone has a different color present.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  This changes the colors again.

The important thing is that the colors don't change.  So, Gertrude will still have the brown present.

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Bob is the right winger.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Gertrude becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes the right winger, and Fred becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the right winger.

So, Bob is now the **fullback**. 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **Claire and Bob:**  Claire gives Bob her red ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave takes Claire's red ball.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets Gertrude's orange ball.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gives Eve his blue ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave her red ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice takes Bob's black ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's black ball.

So, at the end, Fred has the blue ball. 


**Answer:** (A) 
"
"Eve ends up with the green ball. 

Here's why:

* **Think about the trades:**  We need to figure out who gets which ball at the end. 
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gives Alice her green ball. 


So the answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out where Gertrude is at the end!

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder

So, Gertrude is now playing **Left Midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a brown present, Bob has a yellow one, Claire has a blue one, Dave has a green one, Eve has a pink ball, Fred has a black ball, and Gertrude has a purple one.

* **Swapping:**  We see that people swap gifts in pairs.  

* **The key is to remember that Fred's present is the same throughout the swaps.** 


**Answer:**  Fred's present is the black ball. 
"
"Let's figure out what book Bob has at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with whom.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with The Pearl, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Moby Dick, Eve starts with Ulysses.
4. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Pearl.
5. **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Pearl.
6. **Bob and Fred:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
7. **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.

**So, the answer is (B) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the white ball!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  Bob gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

So, the final ball distribution is:

* Bob: White
* Claire: Green
* Dave: Pink
* Eve: Orange
* Fred: Black
* Gertrude: Brown
* Alice: Pink 



 
"
"Let's figure out who has which book at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

**So, to figure out who has which book, we need to think about who traded with whom.** 

Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle!

"Fred got Catch-22! 

Here's why:

* Fred started with *Lolita*.
* Then, Fred and Eve swapped books.
* Fred and Gertrude swapped books. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Let's break down the trading!

* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

So, Bob ends up with the yellow ball. 

**Answer: (F) yellow ball.** 



"
"Claire is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

* The positions were swapped in a series of pairs. 
* We know Eve and Alice switched positions, then Alice and Fred switched positions, and so on. 
* The final position swap was between Alice and Dave. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Alice and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Gertrude switched partners, and so on.  Let's look at the changes:

* Alice and Bob switched partners.
* Eve and Gertrude switched partners.
* Claire and Gertrude switched partners.
* Gertrude and Bob switched partners.
* Claire and Bob switched partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switched partners.
* Claire and Dave switched partners.

The last step is the most important!  We need to figure out who is dancing with Alice.

"Let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is with Melissa.
* **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred now dances with Ophelia, Eve now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Claire, Dave now dances with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Claire now dances with Karl.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude now dances with Ophelia, Fred now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Dave now dances with Karl.

So, after all the switching, Claire is dancing with Karl! 


The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Bob is dancing with at the end!

We know that Bob and Dave switched partners, then Fred and Bob switched partners, and then Eve and Bob switched partners.  

Let's look at the final dance:

* Bob is dancing with **Lola**! 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who Fred is dancing with!

We know that Fred and Gertrude switched partners. Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Dave and Bob switched partners. Then Bob and Claire switched partners.  Then Alice and Gertrude switched partners. Then Dave and Alice switched partners. Finally, Eve and Gertrude switched partners. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Karl. 

The answer is (F). 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of friends who like to trade books!  Let's figure out what book Gertrude has at the end.

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start:**  We know each person gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see how the books get traded around.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Eve swap books.
2. Bob and Gertrude swap books.
3. Claire and Dave swap books.
4. Gertrude and Dave swap books.
5. Alice and Fred swap books.
6. Eve and Fred swap books.
7. Gertrude and Bob swap books.

**The key is to remember that the swaps are happening in a circle.**  

So, at the end, Gertrude has the book she swapped with Bob. 


**The answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts, but we don't know what they swapped.  

To figure out who has what, we need to think about how the gifts are being swapped.  

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means they traded their gifts. 
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  They also traded their gifts. 

We can't figure out who has what because we don't know what gifts were swapped. 



"
"Okay, so we have six friends who love to read!  They all got a new book at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books with each other.  Let's see who ends up with what book at the end!

Here's how the trades went:

* Alice and Eve switched books.
* Dave and Fred switched books.
* Gertrude and Bob switched books.
* Alice and Claire switched books.
* Fred and Claire switched books.
* Bob and Gertrude switched books.

The last swap was between Fred and Claire.  

So, who has the book at the end?  Gertrude got the book that was in Fred's hands.  

The answer is **(E) The Odyssey**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color ball Alice has at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Fred and Bob swap balls.
* Eve and Fred swap balls.
* Dave and Eve swap balls.
* Alice and Bob swap balls.
* Dave and Fred swap balls.
* Bob and Claire swap balls.
* Gertrude and Alice swap balls.

Notice that Alice and Gertrude swap balls.  This means that Alice ends up with the ball that Gertrude had.  

So the answer is **(C) brown ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Dave is the goalkeeper. Bob is the left midfielder, Claire is the right winger, Alice is the left winger, Eve is the right midfielder, Fred is the benchwarmer, and Gertrude is the center midfielder.

* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob moves to the left winger spot, and Fred moves to the left midfielder spot.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob moves to the left winger spot, and Dave moves to the left midfielder spot.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude moves to the right winger spot, and Eve moves to the right midfielder spot.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob moves to the left winger spot, and Dave moves to the left midfielder spot.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude moves to the left winger spot, and Dave moves to the center midfielder spot.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve moves to the right midfielder spot, and Alice moves to the right winger spot.
* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice moves to the right midfielder spot, and Claire moves to the right winger spot.

**So, Dave is now playing center midfielder!**

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  It's like a game of musical presents! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **We start with:**
    * Alice: Blue
    * Bob: Black
    * Claire: Purple
    * Dave: Pink
    * Eve: Green
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Yellow

* **The swaps:**
    * Bob and Alice swap gifts.
    * Eve and Fred swap gifts.
    * Bob and Alice swap gifts again.
    * Dave and Claire swap gifts.
    * Claire and Bob swap gifts.
    * Bob and Fred swap gifts.
    * Claire and Gertrude swap gifts.

**The problem is, we don't know who has what after each swap!**  It's like a puzzle, and we need more information to solve it. 



**So, none of the answer choices are correct.** 



"
"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know Fred and Gertrude switched partners.
* Then Dave and Claire switched partners.
* Then Dave and Bob switched partners.
* Then Bob and Claire switched partners.
* Then Alice and Gertrude switched partners.
* Then Dave and Alice switched partners.
* Finally, Eve and Gertrude switched partners. 



Let me know if you have any other dance questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Dave is playing right midfielder, Gertrude is playing fullback, Fred is playing left winger, Alice is playing left midfielder, Bob is playing cheerleader, Claire is playing right winger, and Eve is playing striker.

* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes right midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Fred becomes fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes cheerleader, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes right midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Claire becomes striker.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes right winger, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

**So, Dave is now playing right winger!** 

The answer is (G). 



"
"Alice ends up with the white present! 

Here's why:

* **Alice starts with a white present.**
* **Alice and Eve swap gifts.**  This means Eve's pink ball is now Alice's.
* **Eve and Fred swap gifts.** This means Fred's orange ball is now Eve's.
* **Alice and Bob swap gifts.** This means Bob's yellow present is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Dave swap gifts.** This means Dave's black ball is now Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap gifts.** This means Claire's red present is now Eve's.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap gifts.** This means Gertrude's purple present is now Bob's.
* **Eve and Alice swap gifts.** This means Alice's white present is now Eve's. 



So, Alice ends up with the white present!

"Let's figure out who Dave is dancing with!

We know that Dave started with Karl.  Then, Dave and Fred switched partners.  Then, Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then, Dave and Gertrude switched partners.  Then, Dave and Bob switched partners.  Then, Alice and Claire switched partners.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude switched partners. 

So, the last step is to figure out who Dave is dancing with.  

The answer is **(D) Izzi**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is with Karl, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Jamie, Eve is with Helga, Fred is with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is with Ophelia.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Helga.

* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Gertrude.

* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude is now with Ophelia, and Dave is with Jamie.

* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve is now with Karl, and Bob is with Helga.

* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Ophelia.

* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Helga.

* **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred is now with Ophelia, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.

**So, Bob is now dancing with Izzi!** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Gertrude ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's ball.  

So the answer is (D) yellow ball. 
"
"Fred is now playing left midfielder! 

Here's why:

* Fred started as a left winger.
* Then, Fred and Bob switched positions.
* Then, Claire and Fred switched positions. 
* Finally, Dave and Fred switched positions. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Let's break down the ball swapping!

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.

* **Start:** Bob is the goalkeeper, Claire is the center midfielder, Dave is the right midfielder, Eve is the fullback, Fred is the left midfielder, and Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude moves to the left midfielder position, and Eve moves to the fullback position.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude moves to the left midfielder position, and Alice moves to the left winger position.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve moves to the center midfielder position, and Claire moves to the fullback position.
* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred moves to the left midfielder position, and Eve moves to the fullback position.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire moves to the right midfielder position, and Gertrude moves to the left midfielder position.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to the right midfielder position, and Dave moves to the left midfielder position.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred moves to the goalkeeper position, and Bob moves to the left midfielder position.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about how this works.

"Okay, so we have to figure out what book Dave has at the end!

Let's think about the swaps:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change who has which book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

So, Dave started with The Odyssey.  Then Claire and Dave swapped books.  

**The answer is (G) The Odyssey.**

"Let's figure out who has which book at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start with the initial books:** Alice has Ulysses, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave has The Pearl, Eve has Hound of the Baskervilles, Fred has Lolita, and Gertrude has Catch-22.

* **Look at the swaps:**
    * Bob and Claire swap books.
    * Dave and Bob swap books.
    * Claire and Fred swap books.
    * Claire and Dave swap books.
    * Fred and Eve swap books.
    * Alice and Dave swap books.
    * Fred and Gertrude swap books.

* **Now, let's see who has what book at the end:**

    * Alice:  We know Alice and Dave swapped books, and Dave got Ulysses. So Alice must have the Pearl.
    * Bob:  Bob and Claire swapped books, and Claire got The Great Gatsby. So Bob must have The Fellowship of the Ring.
    * Claire: Claire and Fred swapped books, and Fred got Lolita. So Claire must have The Pearl.
    * Dave: Dave and Bob swapped books, and Bob got The Pearl. So Dave must have The Great Gatsby.
    * Eve: Fred and Eve swapped books, and Fred got Hound of the Baskervilles. So Eve must have Lolita.
    * Fred: Fred and Gertrude swapped books, and Gertrude got Catch-22. So Fred must have Lolita.
    * Gertrude: Gertrude got Catch-22, and Fred swapped books with her. So Gertrude must have The Great Gatsby.



**Answer:**
(D) The Pearl 
 
 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of friends who love to read!  Let's see what happens to their books after they trade them around.

First, they all get new books to start.  Then, they trade them back and forth.  

* **Gertrude and Fred swap books.**  
* **Alice and Claire swap books.**
* **Bob and Dave swap books.**
* **Claire and Dave swap books.**
* **Bob and Eve swap books.**
* **Claire and Dave swap books.**
* **Eve and Alice swap books.**

Now, we need to figure out what book Dave has at the end.  He traded with a lot of people, so we need to think about who he traded with. 

Dave traded with Alice, Claire, Bob, and Eve.  

**Dave ends up with Catch-22.**

"Let's break down the trading!

* **Fred and Gertrude:** They swap balls, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball and Gertrude gets Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap balls, so Bob gets Gertrude's ball and Gertrude gets Bob's ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap balls, so Claire gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Claire's ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap balls, so Dave gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Dave's ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap balls, so Eve gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Eve's ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap balls, so Bob gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap balls, so Eve gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Eve's ball.

So, at the end of the game, Dave has the ball that was originally Claire's ball. 


**Therefore, the answer is (C) yellow ball.** 
"
"Gertrude is dancing with Alice at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know that Dave and Fred switch partners.
* Then, Dave and Gertrude switch partners. 
* Then, Dave and Bob switch partners. 
* Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. 
* Finally, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. 



 
"
"Eve is dancing with Izzi! 

Here's why:

* Eve and Claire switched partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switched partners.
* Eve and Bob switched partners.
* Eve and Alice switched partners.
* Dave and Bob switched partners.
* Dave and Eve switched partners.
* Alice and Dave switched partners. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who has the white ball!

We know that Dave and Alice traded balls, then Alice and Fred, then Fred and Dave again.  This means the ball that Dave started with is now with Alice.  Then, Fred and Dave swapped, so Fred got the pink ball.  

Next, Eve and Bob swapped, so Bob got the blue ball.  Then Claire and Fred swapped, so Fred got the white ball.  Finally, Bob and Gertrude swapped, so Gertrude got the orange ball.  

The last swap was between Gertrude and Alice, so Alice got the yellow ball.  

So, Claire has the white ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who has which book!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
2. **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap books, so Gertrude now has Bob's book.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve and Bob swap, so Eve now has Bob's book.
4. **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap, so Dave now has Bob's book.
5. **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has Fred's book.
6. **Claire and Alice:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's book.
7. **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap again, so Bob now has Dave's book.
8. **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so Fred now has Eve's book.

**So, at the end of the semester, Fred has Eve's book!** 



 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:**  We know everyone has a different color present.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:**  This means Eve's black ball is now Fred's pink ball, and Fred's pink ball is now Eve's black ball.
3. **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave's green present is now Bob's yellow present, and Bob's yellow present is now Dave's green present.
4. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire's purple present is now Gertrude's blue present, and Gertrude's blue present is now Claire's purple present.
5. **Fred and Claire swap:**  Fred's pink ball is now Claire's purple present, and Claire's purple present is now Fred's pink ball.
6. **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  Gertrude's blue present is now Alice's brown present, and Alice's brown present is now Gertrude's blue present.
7. **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob's yellow present is now Claire's purple present, and Claire's purple present is now Bob's yellow present.

**So, the final gift Dave has is the green present!** 


**Answer:** (F) green present. 
"
"Okay, so we have seven friends who love to read!  They all got a new book at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books a bunch of times.  

Let's see who Fred ends up with at the end.  

Fred got Moby Dick from Dave.  

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Gertrude ends up playing benchwarmer!  Here's why:

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the goalkeeper, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the center midfielder, Fred is the fullback, and Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Trades:**  The players swap positions a few times.  

* **Final Position:**  Gertrude ends up in the benchwarmer position. 



"
"Okay, I can do that!  Let's break down the problem. 

We need to figure out which book Claire has.  

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Fred and Alice swap books.**
* **Fred and Eve swap books.**
* **Fred and Dave swap books.**
* **Claire and Fred swap books.**
* **Gertrude and Dave swap books.**
* **Fred and Alice swap books.**
* **Fred and Bob swap books.**

"Eve ends up with the blue ball!  Here's why:

* Eve and Gertrude swap balls.
* Fred and Bob swap balls.
* Fred and Claire swap balls.
* Eve and Fred swap balls.
* Fred and Claire swap balls.
* Alice and Bob swap balls.
* Dave and Gertrude swap balls.

"Okay, let's figure out who has The Odyssey at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Fred starts with The Odyssey.**  
* **Fred swaps with Alice.**
* **Fred swaps with Eve.**
* **Fred swaps with Dave.**
* **Fred swaps with Claire.**
* **Fred swaps with Gertrude.**
* **Fred swaps with Bob.**

So, Fred has The Odyssey at the end. 


**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
* **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

So, to figure out who Fred is dancing with, we need to look at who was originally dancing with Alice. 


**Answer: (D) Melissa** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the book at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Alice has Ulysses, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has The Odyssey, Dave has Catch-22, Eve has Lolita, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Gertrude has Moby Dick.

* **We know they trade books:**  They swap books with each other.

* **Let's see the swaps:**
    * Gertrude and Fred swap books.
    * Alice and Claire swap books.
    * Bob and Dave swap books.
    * Claire and Dave swap books.
    * Bob and Eve swap books.
    * Claire and Dave swap books.
    * Eve and Alice swap books.

* **The final book:**  We need to figure out who has the book at the end. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see who ends up with what.

First, Claire and Bob swap.  Then, Alice and Gertrude swap.  Then, Claire and Dave swap.  Dave and Gertrude swap again.  Then, Eve and Fred swap.  Finally, Bob and Eve swap.  And then, Gertrude and Claire swap again.

The last swap is important because it tells us who has the ball at the end.  Fred didn't swap with anyone in the last round, so he must have the purple ball. 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so they all get new books at the start of the semester.  Then they trade them around!  Let's see who ends up with what book.

Here's how it goes:

* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap books.
* **Fred and Dave:** They swap books.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap books.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap books.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap books.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap books.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap books.

So, who has what book at the end?  Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave gets a purple ball, Bob gets an orange ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gets a blue ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets a black ball, Eve gets a white ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire gets a black ball, Eve gets a white ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve gets a pink ball, Fred gets a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets a pink ball, Claire gets a black ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets a pink ball, Fred gets a black ball.

So, Fred ends up with the black ball. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **First swap:** Claire and Bob trade their balls.
* **Second swap:** Dave and Claire trade their balls.
* **Third swap:** Fred and Gertrude trade their balls.
* **Fourth swap:** Fred and Eve trade their balls.
* **Fifth swap:** Claire and Dave trade their balls.
* **Sixth swap:** Alice and Bob trade their balls.
* **Seventh swap:** Dave and Bob trade their balls.

Now, the last swap is the most important!  We need to figure out who ends up with the ball that was originally Bob's. 


**Answer:** (F) black ball 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the green ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Fred and Alice swap. Fred gets Alice's pink ball, and Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap. Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, and Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
* Bob and Dave swap. Bob gets Dave's purple ball, and Dave gets Bob's red ball.
* Eve and Alice swap. Eve gets Alice's black ball, and Alice gets Eve's black ball.
* Claire and Bob swap. Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
* Dave and Eve swap. Dave gets Eve's black ball, and Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
* Claire and Bob swap. Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

So, Fred ends up with the green ball. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's look at the dance changes:

1. Dave and Eve switch partners.
2. Gertrude and Dave switch partners.
3. Bob and Gertrude switch partners.
4. Bob and Fred switch partners.
5. Alice and Eve switch partners.
6. Bob and Claire switch partners.
7. Gertrude and Fred switch partners.

We can see that the dance partners are switching partners in a circular pattern.  

So, to find Alice's final partner, we need to figure out who she is dancing with at the end. 



**Answer: (B) Karl** 
"
"Eve ends up with the pink ball. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so Eve gets a brown ball and Bob gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Swap, so Alice gets a brown ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so Claire gets a brown ball and Gertrude gets a pink ball.
* **Fred and Eve:** Swap, so Eve gets a green ball and Fred gets a pink ball.

So, at the end of the dance, Gertrude is dancing with **Jamie**.

So, we can see that Bob got a green present from Dave and then a blue present from Dave.

"Gertrude is dancing with Fred at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know Fred and Claire switched partners.
* Then Alice and Bob switched partners.
* Then Dave and Eve switched partners.
* Then Gertrude and Fred switched partners.
* Then Alice and Bob switched partners.
* Then Alice and Fred switched partners.
* Finally, Fred and Claire switched partners. 



 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's figure out what Dave ends up with.

Here's how the swaps work:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Eve and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Bob swap.
4. Claire and Dave swap.
5. Eve and Claire swap.
6. Bob and Gertrude swap.
7. Eve and Alice swap.

So, let's think about what happened to each person's gift. 

* **Dave** started with a black ball.
* **Claire** gave Dave her red gift. 

So, Dave now has the **red present**. 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens.

Here's how the trading works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her blue ball, and Dave gives Eve her red ball.
2. **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gives Eve her yellow ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her blue ball.
3. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gives Bob his black ball.
4. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gives Claire her black ball.
5. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her green ball, and Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives Fred his blue ball, and Fred gives Eve her black ball.

**Final Ball:** Fred ends up with the **black ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the striker, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the left winger, Fred is the center midfielder, and Gertrude is the right winger.

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, Bob becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes the striker, Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the benchwarmer, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the right winger, Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes the right winger, Bob becomes the center midfielder.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes the center midfielder, Alice becomes the right winger.

So, Bob is now the center midfielder! 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the book Alice had at the start!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Alice started with:** Lolita
* **The swaps:**  We need to see who got which book after each swap. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets Fred's book, Fred gets Eve's book.
2. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
3. Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets Eve's book, Eve gets Fred's book.
4. Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets Alice's book, Alice gets Gertrude's book.
5. Fred and Dave swap: Fred gets Dave's book, Dave gets Fred's book.
6. Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
7. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.

**So, the final book Alice has is The Great Gatsby.**

"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Fred and Eve switch places. Fred becomes the fullback, and Eve becomes the goalkeeper.
2. Eve and Claire switch places. Eve becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the fullback.
3. Fred and Bob switch places. Fred becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
4. Gertrude and Fred switch places. Gertrude becomes the goalkeeper, and Fred becomes the right winger.
5. Alice and Eve switch places. Alice becomes the fullback, and Eve becomes the striker.
6. Eve and Dave switch places. Eve becomes the right midfielder, and Dave becomes the fullback.
7. Bob and Alice switch places. Bob becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the striker.

So, Fred ends up playing right winger.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing **fullback**.

"Okay, so they all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded them around!  Let's see who ends up with what.

* Fred and Eve swap books.
* Gertrude and Alice swap books.
* Dave and Claire swap books.
* Alice and Bob swap books.
* Alice and Fred swap books.
* Eve and Dave swap books.
* Eve and Alice swap books.

So, to figure out who has what at the end, we need to look at who swapped with whom.  

Fred and Eve swapped books, so Fred got Eve's book and Eve got Fred's book.  

We also know that Alice and Fred swapped books, so Fred got Alice's book and Alice got Fred's book. 

So, Fred has Catch-22. 



 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what Bob has at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets brown, Alice gets pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.

Bob started with a white present.  He then swapped with Eve, then with Fred, and then with Bob again.  So, Bob ends up with the white present. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's see what happens:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Purple
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Green
    * Eve: Black
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: White

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's present.
* **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Fred's present.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Claire's present.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Gertrude gets Dave's present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Bob's present.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Fred's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Alice's present.

So, at the end, Alice has the present that was originally Bob's. 

**The answer is (E) brown present.** 



"
"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

We know that Alice and Eve switched partners, then Dave and Fred switched partners, and so on.  

Here's what we know:

* Alice started with Lola.
* Eve started with Sam.
* Dave and Fred switched partners.
* Eve and Claire switched partners.
* Dave and Bob switched partners.
* Alice and Claire switched partners.
* Eve and Gertrude switched partners.

So, the final answer is Sam. 


**Answer: (E)**

"Okay, so they all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded them around!  Let's see who ends up with what at the end.

* **Gertrude** gets Hound of the Baskervilles. 


**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  Alice has pink, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has blue, Eve has white, Fred has orange, and Gertrude has black.

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has Alice's pink gift, and Alice now has Dave's blue gift.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Now Dave has Claire's red gift, and Claire has Dave's blue gift.

* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred gets Gertrude's orange gift, and Gertrude gets Fred's black gift.

* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve gets Gertrude's white gift, and Gertrude gets Eve's white gift.

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets Alice's pink gift, and Alice gets Eve's white gift.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets Bob's brown gift, and Bob gets Dave's blue gift.

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude gets Dave's blue gift, and Dave gets Gertrude's black gift.

**So, at the end, Dave has the black ball!** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's break down the ball swapping!

It looks like the players are taking turns trading their balls.  Here's how it works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve his ball.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Claire her ball.
3. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Dave his ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Bob his ball.
5. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his ball, and Dave gives Fred his ball.
6. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
7. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Dave his ball.

So, the final distribution of the balls is a cycle.  The final ball distribution is:

* **Eve:** White ball
* **Dave:** Pink ball
* **Claire:** Purple ball
* **Bob:** Brown ball

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they both started with different books.

So, we know that everyone started with a different book.  We can't figure out who has which book at the end.

"Okay, so let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners a few times.  Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Fred switch partners:**  This means Fred is now dancing with Claire.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with Dave.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Gertrude is now dancing with Dave.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with Sam.
* **Dave and Fred switch partners:** This means Dave is now dancing with Melissa.
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:** This means Eve is now dancing with Dave.

So, Claire is dancing with Sam! 


The answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Fred gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Fred's present.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Fred gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Fred's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  This means Fred gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Fred's present.

So, the final gift Alice has is the one that was originally Fred's. 

**Answer:** (F) orange ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has which book at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Claire has *Moby Dick*, Dave has *The Pearl*, Eve has *The Great Gatsby*, Fred has *Catch-22*, and Gertrude has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **We know they trade books:**  They swap books in a round-robin fashion. 

* **Let's see the swaps:**
    * Gertrude and Dave swap books.
    * Eve and Claire swap books.
    * Dave and Gertrude swap books.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap books.
    * Alice and Eve swap books.
    * Bob and Dave swap books.
    * Alice and Fred swap books.

* **Now, let's think about who has what book at the end:**  We need to figure out who got which book after all the swaps.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  Alice has pink, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has blue, Eve has white, Fred has orange, and Gertrude has black.

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has Alice's pink gift, and Alice now has Dave's blue gift.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Now Dave has Claire's red gift, and Claire has Dave's blue gift.

* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred's orange gift is now Gertrude's black gift, and Gertrude's black gift is now Fred's orange gift.

* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's white gift is now Gertrude's black gift, and Gertrude's black gift is now Eve's white gift.

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's white gift is now Alice's pink gift, and Alice's pink gift is now Eve's white gift.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave's blue gift is now Bob's brown gift, and Bob's brown gift is now Dave's blue gift.

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude's black gift is now Dave's blue gift, and Dave's blue gift is now Gertrude's black gift.

**So, after all the swaps, who has the black ball?**

**Answer:** (E) black ball 



"
"Gertrude ends up playing Center Midfielder! 

Here's how we know:

* **Start:** Gertrude is the Left Midfielder.
* **Bob and Gertrude trade:** Bob becomes Left Winger, Gertrude becomes Center Midfielder. 



So the answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* Alice starts as the center midfielder.
* Then, Claire and Alice switch places.
* Then, Gertrude and Bob switch places.
* Then, Eve and Alice switch places.
* Then, Claire and Fred switch places.
* Then, Gertrude and Dave switch places.
* Finally, Eve and Fred switch places.
* Fred and Bob switch places.

So, Claire ends up playing right winger. 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Eve gets the blue ball! 

Here's why:

* Alice and Fred swap, then Gertrude and Fred swap, then Bob and Dave swap, then Alice and Bob swap, then Claire and Fred swap, then Claire and Gertrude swap, and finally Alice and Eve swap. 

Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Fred is playing right midfielder.
* Alice is the cheerleader.
* Bob is the right winger.
* Claire is the fullback.
* Dave is the striker.
* Eve is the benchwarmer.
* Gertrude is the left winger.

Then, they trade positions a few times.  Fred and Alice switch, then Fred and Gertrude switch, then Bob and Fred switch again.  Finally, Dave and Bob switch. 

So, Fred ends up playing left winger. 


**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who has which book at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Fred and Dave swap:**  They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve had a book Fred traded.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve had a book Bob traded.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.

**The swaps are happening in a circular fashion, so we can deduce that the final book ownership is:**

* **Gertrude:** Ulysses
* **Bob:** The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:** The Odyssey
* **Alice:** Moby Dick

"Okay, so let's figure out who Fred is dancing with!

We know that Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then, Dave and Eve switched partners.  Then, Alice and Claire switched partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switched partners again.  Then, Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then, Dave and Eve switched partners again.  Finally, Fred and Gertrude switched partners. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Gertrude.

"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave takes Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude takes Dave's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve takes Alice's ball.

So, Dave ends up with the ball he swapped with Fred. 



**Answer:** (A) black ball.

"Let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that the dancers switch partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
* **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the yellow ball at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* Fred and Eve swap.
* Claire and Bob swap.
* Fred and Bob swap.
* Eve and Alice swap.
* Bob and Gertrude swap.
* Bob and Claire swap.
* Dave and Eve swap.

Notice that the swapping happens in pairs.  This means that the ball that is swapped is always the same color.  

So, the yellow ball is the one that Claire ends up with. 


**Answer: (D) yellow ball.** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  We know who has what color gift.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This means Gertrude's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Gertrude's.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave's gift is now Eve's, and Eve's gift is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Alice's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Alice's.
* **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means Fred's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Fred's.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  This means Claire's gift is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's gift is now Claire's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Gertrude's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Gertrude's.

So, the final gift is the one that was originally Eve's.  

**Answer: (A) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Bob is dancing with!

We know that Bob started with Patrick.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switched partners.  Then, Bob and Alice switched partners.  Then, Eve and Gertrude switched partners.  Then, Fred and Claire switched partners.  Then, Fred and Bob switched partners.  Finally, Dave and Fred switched partners. 

So, the last step is to figure out who Bob is dancing with. 



The answer is **(D) Patrick**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about how the colors might change. 

* **Fred and Alice:** Fred gets Claire's present, and Alice gets Fred's present.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Eve's present, and Claire gets Fred's present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gets Eve's present, and Bob gets Dave's present.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gets Claire's present, and Dave gets Fred's present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Bob's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's present.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Claire's present, and Eve gets Fred's present.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Dave's present, and Bob gets Claire's present.

So, Eve ends up with Fred's present, which is the pink ball. 

**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Dave has Moby Dick! 

Here's why:

*  We know everyone gets a new book at the start.
*  The book swaps happen in a circle, so we can figure out who has what book by following the order of the swaps. 
*  Dave starts with Moby Dick. 



 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the brown ball at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets Alice's pink ball, Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's purple ball, Dave gets Bob's red ball.
* Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Alice's black ball, Alice gets Eve's black ball.
* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Eve's black ball, Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
* Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

So, the final swap is Claire and Bob swapping.  Claire ends up with the brown ball. 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping!

It looks like the game is a simple round-robin where everyone trades with everyone else.  

Here's how the balls end up:

* **Start:**  Each person has a unique ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.

**The answer is (C) orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end!

We know that Fred and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Alice switched partners, and then Fred and Eve switched partners again.  Then Claire and Fred switched partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Alice switched partners. 

So, the last step is to figure out who Alice is dancing with. 



**Answer: (B) Rodrigo** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:**  We know who has what color gift to begin with.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude now has Eve's gift.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude now has Bob's gift.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:**  This means Fred now has Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude now has Fred's gift.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has Bob's gift, and Bob now has Dave's gift.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Alice's gift, and Alice now has Bob's gift.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has Dave's gift, and Dave now has Claire's gift.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Alice now has Claire's gift, and Claire now has Alice's gift.

So, we need to figure out who has the blue present. 


**The answer is (D) blue present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the book that was originally owned by Gertrude!

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial list:**  We know everyone got a new book at the beginning of the semester.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We see that some books were swapped around. 
* **Think about who swapped with whom:**  We need to figure out who got the book that was originally Gertrude's.

Let me know if you want to try another book swap puzzle!

* **Then, Claire and Fred switch places.**
* **Then, Dave and Eve switch places.**
* **Then, Gertrude and Bob switch places.**
* **Finally, Gertrude and Dave switch places.**

So, Fred is now playing left winger.

* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's book, Claire gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gets Dave's book, Dave gets Claire's book.

So, at the end of the semester, Claire has all the books! 


**Answer:**  (None of the above)

"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the striker, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the left winger, Fred is the center midfielder, and Gertrude is the right winger.

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the striker, Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, Bob becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes the striker, Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the benchwarmer, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the right winger, Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes the center midfielder, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes the center midfielder, Alice becomes the right winger.

So, at the end of the game, Claire is playing **center midfielder**. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end!

We know that Dave and Bob switched partners. Then Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then Claire and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Alice and Eve switched partners. Then Gertrude and Alice switched partners. Then Eve and Fred switched partners. Finally, Gertrude and Claire switched partners. 

So, the last step is to figure out who Dave is dancing with.

"Okay, let's break down the ball trading!

Eve and Gertrude swap balls, then Dave and Alice swap balls.  This means Eve gets a new ball and Gertrude gets a new ball.  

The pattern continues with Fred and Dave, Bob and Fred, Claire and Dave, and finally Bob and Dave again. 

So, the final ball distribution is:

* Eve: Pink ball
* Bob: Black ball
* Claire: Red ball
* Dave: Yellow ball
* Fred: White ball
* Gertrude: Orange ball
* Alice: Brown ball 


The answer is **(E) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
* **Fred and Bob switch partners.**
* **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
* **Claire and Eve switch partners.**

Let's look at the final dance:

* **Alice is dancing with...**

We can figure out who Alice is dancing with by looking at the final dance. 



 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's white gift becomes Eve's pink gift.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink gift becomes Fred's orange gift.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's white gift becomes Bob's yellow gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red gift becomes Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink gift becomes Claire's red gift.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow gift becomes Gertrude's purple present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange gift becomes Alice's white gift.

So, after all the swaps, Claire has the red present! 

**Answer: (A) red present** 



"
"Eve ends up with Dave's book! 

Here's why:

* Eve and Gertrude swap books.
* Bob and Eve swap books.
* Alice and Gertrude swap books.
* Claire and Eve swap books.
* Eve and Alice swap books.
* Fred and Alice swap books.
* Eve and Dave swap books. 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Eve is the striker!  Here's why:

* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Claire becomes striker. 

Let me know if you have any other soccer puzzles! 
"
"Alice starts as a left midfielder.  Then, she and Dave switch places.  Then, she and Claire switch places.  Then, she and Dave switch places again.  Then, Claire and Fred switch places.  Then, Dave and Eve switch places.  Finally, Gertrude and Bob switch places.  

So, Alice is now playing left winger. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve is getting the red ball, and Dave is getting the blue ball. 

Then, Eve and Alice swap, and Bob and Alice swap.  This means that Alice is now holding the red ball.

Finally, Gertrude and Claire swap, and Alice and Dave swap.  This means that Claire is holding the pink ball. 


So the answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:**
    * Bob is the right winger.
    * Claire is the center midfielder.
    * Dave is the fullback.
    * Eve is the left winger.
    * Fred is the cheerleader.
    * Gertrude is the striker.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes the left winger, Eve becomes the fullback.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the right winger, Alice becomes the fullback.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes the striker, Gertrude becomes the center midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes the right winger, Dave becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes the center midfielder, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Claire trade:** Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, Claire becomes the striker.

**So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing right winger.** 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color ball Alice has at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Alice and Eve swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Alice and Gertrude swap.
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Bob and Fred swap.
* Gertrude and Bob swap.
* Gertrude and Claire swap.

We can see that Alice is always getting a ball from someone else.  So, the answer is (C). 



"
"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

Here's why:

* We know that Fred and Claire switched partners.
* Then, Alice and Bob switched partners.
* Dave and Eve switched partners.

"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

First, Dave and Fred swap.  Then, Bob and Fred swap.  Then, Gertrude and Dave swap.  Dave and Claire swap.  Dave and Eve swap.  Claire and Bob swap.  Finally, Dave and Alice swap.

The last swap is between Dave and Alice.  Dave ends up with the blue present. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

We know that the dancers switch partners a few times.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice goes with Izzi, Bob goes with Helga.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners:** Eve goes with Rodrigo, Gertrude goes with Patrick.
* **Alice and Claire switch partners:** Alice goes with Melissa, Claire goes with Rodrigo.
* **Eve and Dave switch partners:** Eve goes with Sam, Dave goes with Rodrigo.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** Bob goes with Ophelia, Alice goes with Rodrigo.
* **Bob and Fred switch partners:** Bob goes with Melissa, Fred goes with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Eve switch partners:** Bob goes with Ophelia, Eve goes with Sam.

So, after all the switching, Claire is dancing with Rodrigo. 


The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's think about how this works:

* **First Swap:** Bob and Eve swap.  This means Bob gets Eve's present and Eve gets Bob's present.
* **Second Swap:** Claire and Gertrude swap.  This means Claire gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Claire's present.
* **Third Swap:** Gertrude and Dave swap.  This means Gertrude gets Dave's present and Dave gets Gertrude's present.
* **Fourth Swap:** Eve and Fred swap.  This means Eve gets Fred's present and Fred gets Eve's present.
* **Fifth Swap:** Fred and Bob swap.  This means Fred gets Bob's present and Bob gets Fred's present.
* **Sixth Swap:** Claire and Alice swap.  This means Claire gets Alice's present and Alice gets Claire's present.
* **Seventh Swap:** Fred and Bob swap.  This means Fred gets Bob's present and Bob gets Fred's present.

Now, we need to figure out what Gertrude has at the end.  

**The answer is (E) orange ball.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps!

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred gets a new ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Bob gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a new ball.

**Answer: (E) black ball** 



"
"Eve is playing Left Winger at the end of the match.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Alice's present.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Gertrude gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Claire's present.

So, after all the swaps, who has the brown present? 



**Answer:** (E) brown present. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  Let's figure out what Gertrude ends up with.

Here's how it works:

1. **Start:** Gertrude has the orange ball.
2. **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's green gift goes to Alice, and Alice's green gift goes to Bob.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire's purple gift goes to Dave, and Dave's red gift goes to Claire.
4. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob's white gift goes to Gertrude, and Gertrude's orange ball goes to Bob.
5. **Fred and Bob:** Fred's yellow gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Fred.
6. **Claire and Eve:** Claire's purple gift goes to Eve, and Eve's blue gift goes to Claire.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Alice's green gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Alice.

**The key is to remember that the gifts are swapped in pairs.**  

So, Gertrude ends up with Bob's white gift. 

**Answer:** (E) white present. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* Alice and Eve swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Alice and Gertrude swap.
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Bob and Fred swap.
* Gertrude and Bob swap.
* Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that the only person who gets a new ball is Claire.  She gets the black ball from Gertrude. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them around.  

Here's the thing:  The swaps don't change the color of the balls.  So, Fred ends up with the ball he started with. 


**Answer:** (B) white ball. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps!

* Eve and Claire swap, so Claire gets the purple ball.
* Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets the purple ball.
* Claire and Alice swap, so Alice gets the purple ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets the purple ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets the purple ball.
* Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets the purple ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets the pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Claire has the pink ball. 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the right winger, Claire is the center midfielder, Dave is the cheerleader, Eve is the right midfielder, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, Eve becomes the right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes the left winger, Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the right winger, Bob becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes the left winger, Alice becomes the striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes the striker, Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude becomes the right midfielder, Eve becomes the left winger.

So, at the end of the game, Dave is playing right winger. 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Fred got Frankenstein! 

Here's why:

* Fred started with Frankenstein.
* Then, Fred and Eve swapped books. 
* Fred's book was never changed. 



 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gives Fred her green ball, and Fred gets Alice's green ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gives Dave his brown ball, and Dave gets Eve's brown ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.

So, at the end, Dave has the purple ball. 

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what book Dave ends up with! 

Let's look at the swaps:

* Alice and Bob swap books.
* Eve and Alice swap books.
* Claire and Gertrude swap books.
* Dave and Fred swap books.
* Gertrude and Claire swap books.
* Eve and Claire swap books.
* Gertrude and Dave swap books.

The only swap that makes Dave have a book he didn't start with is the last one.  

So the answer is **(D) Catch-22**.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different colored ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball, and Bob gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Dave his ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.

**The key is to see how the ball distribution changes with each swap.** 

So, after all the swaps, who has the ball that was originally held by Gertrude? 


**Answer:** (G) red ball 
"
"Let's look at the dance swaps:

1. **Fred and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
3. **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
5. **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
7. **Claire and Alice switch partners.**

We can see that Dave is now dancing with someone new. 

**Answer:**  Dave is now dancing with Ophelia. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Eve and Fred swapped balls, then Dave and Claire swapped, and so on.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with orange, Fred starts with pink. They swap, so Fred now has orange and Eve has pink.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with black, Claire starts with red. They swap, so Claire now has black and Dave has red.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice starts with white, Gertrude starts with purple. They swap, so Gertrude now has white and Alice has purple.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude now has white, Eve has pink. They swap, so Eve now has white and Gertrude has pink.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve now has white, Fred has orange. They swap, so Fred now has white and Eve has orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred now has white, Alice has orange. They swap, so Alice now has white and Fred has orange.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice now has white, Bob has yellow. They swap, so Bob now has white and Alice has yellow.

**So, Bob has the yellow ball at the end.** 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people and they're swapping gifts!  

Here's how we can figure out what Claire ends up with:

* **Start:**  We know Claire has a pink ball.
* **Swaps:**  We see that everyone swaps gifts with each other.  
* **The End:**  Since we're just swapping gifts, Claire's gift stays the same. 

So the answer is (G) pink ball. 



"
"Eve ends up with the green present! 

Here's why:

* **We know Eve and Gertrude swapped:**  Eve got a green present from Gertrude.
* **We know Claire and Gertrude swapped:** Claire got a green present from Gertrude. 
 
Let me know if you have any other fun gift swap puzzles! 
 
**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people swapping gifts!  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice's pink goes to Claire's blue.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's brown goes to Bob's red.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice's pink goes to Gertrude's black.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's blue goes to Gertrude's black.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's pink goes to Eve's yellow.
* **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred's white goes to Dave's brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire's blue goes to Alice's pink.

So, the final gift Dave has is the one that was originally Bob's red present. 

**The answer is (E) red present.** 



"
"Gertrude ends up dancing with Dave because of the last swap.  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.

**The final color of the ball that Claire has is the answer.** 



**Answer: (C) blue ball.** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **The Swaps:**  We need to figure out who ends up with which color ball at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:**  Claire starts with red, Bob starts with black.
2. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with pink, Claire starts with red.
3. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with blue, Gertrude starts with orange.
4. **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with blue, Eve starts with white.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with red, Dave starts with pink.

"Okay, let's figure out what book Alice has at the end!

We know that Alice and Fred swap books.  So, if Alice has the book that Fred has, then Alice must have The Odyssey. 


Here's why:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice's book is now Fred's, and Fred's book is now Alice's. 


So the answer is (A) The Odyssey. 



"
"The answer is **(C)**. 

Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Bob and Claire swap balls. This means Bob gets the blue ball and Claire gets the brown ball.
* **Step 2:** Alice and Bob swap balls. This means Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the black ball.
* **Step 3:** Claire and Bob swap balls. This means Claire gets the black ball and Bob gets the blue ball. 


Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Alice starts with Karl, Bob with Rodrigo, and Claire with Patrick.  Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.  Then, Bob and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners.  So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Rodrigo. 

The answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **First swap:** Bob and Alice switch gifts.  
* **Second swap:** Claire and Alice switch gifts.

This means that at the end, Claire will have the gift that was originally Alice's. 


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Bob is playing goalkeeper! 

Here's why:

* Alice started as the cheerleader, then switched to goalkeeper.
* Bob then switched to the cheerleader position.
* Finally, Claire and Bob switched positions. 


Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Bob and Claire switch:**  Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire dances with Bob.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire now dances with Bob, and Alice dances with Claire.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice dances with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with **Claire**. 



"
"Bob is dancing with Izzi! 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob switched partners first.
* Then Alice and Claire switched partners. 
* This means Bob and Alice switched partners. 



 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **First:** Bob and Alice switch partners.
* **Second:** Bob and Claire switch partners.
* **Third:** Bob and Alice switch partners.

Since the dance ends with Claire dancing with Bob, the answer is **(B) Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, so let's break it down:

* **First, Bob and Alice switch partners:**  This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Patrick.
* **Then, Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Izzi, and Bob is with Ophelia.
* **Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Patrick, and Alice is with Izzi.

"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means Bob is now dancing with Alice, and Claire is now dancing with Sam.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Alice is now dancing with Sam.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Sam. 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

Alice starts with a red ball, Bob has an orange ball, and Claire has a black ball.  

They trade balls in pairs.  First, Alice and Bob swap.  Then Alice and Claire swap. Finally, Claire and Bob swap. 

The last step is important because it's the only step where the order matters.  

So, the final order is:

* Alice has the orange ball. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Claire ends up with the purple ball. Here's why:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob starts with a purple ball, and Claire now has the yellow ball. They swap, so Bob gets the yellow ball and Claire gets the purple ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice now has the blue ball, and Claire has the purple ball. 



 
"
"Claire gets Ulysses at the end! 

Here's why:

* **First swap:** Claire and Alice trade books. This means Claire gets Catch-22 and Alice gets Moby Dick.
* **Second swap:** Claire and Bob trade books. This means Claire gets Ulysses and Bob gets Moby Dick. 


So, Claire ends up with Ulysses! 


"
"Okay, so here's how the gift exchange works:

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice starts with yellow, Bob starts with white.  They switch gifts, so Alice gets the white present and Bob gets the yellow present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the yellow present, Claire starts with purple. They switch gifts, so Bob gets the purple present and Claire gets the yellow present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob now has the purple present, Alice starts with the yellow present. They switch gifts, so Bob gets the yellow present and Alice gets the purple present.

So, at the end, Claire has the yellow present. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Bob ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

Here's why:

* **Start:** Alice has Lolita, Bob has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's book (Hound of the Baskervilles) and Bob gets Claire's book (The Fellowship of the Ring).
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's book (Hound of the Baskervilles) and Bob gets Alice's book (Lolita). 


Let me know if you have any other book swap puzzles! 
"
"Claire gets The Great Gatsby at the end! Here's why:

* Alice starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

"Bob ends up dancing with Izzi because of the last switch.  

Here's why:

* **First switch:** Bob and Alice switch partners.
* **Second switch:** Claire and Alice switch partners.
* **Third switch:** Bob and Claire switch partners. 


So, Bob ends up with Izzi. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Alice starts as a fullback, then switches with Claire, who becomes the fullback.  Then Bob switches with Alice, who becomes the left winger.  Finally, Bob switches with Claire, who becomes the left winger.  So, Alice is now playing left winger. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is on the right, and Claire is the goalie.
* **Trade 1:** Claire and Bob switch places.  Claire is now on the right, and Bob is the goalie.
* **Trade 2:** Claire and Alice switch places. Claire is now in the center, and Alice is the goalie.
* **Trade 3:** Bob and Claire switch places. Bob is now in the center, and Claire is on the right.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing **right midfielder**. 


 
"
"Claire ends up with the blue ball. Here's why:

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets the green ball, and Bob gets the yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets the yellow ball, and Claire gets the green ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob the yellow ball, and Bob gets the blue ball. 


So the final answer is (B). 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Alice and Bob switch:**  This means they swap partners.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This means they swap partners.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** This means they swap partners again.

So, the final dance partner for Bob is the one he danced with at the end of the first round. 

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Helga.**

"Bob switches partners with Alice, then with Claire.  Then, Bob switches partners with Alice again.  So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Melissa. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* Alice starts with Sam, then switches with Claire.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Bob and Claire switch partners.

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Rodrigo. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, we know Alice starts with a yellow present. Then, Claire and Alice swap presents.  So, Claire gets Alice's yellow present and Alice gets Claire's green present. 

Then, Bob and Claire swap presents.  So, Bob gets Alice's yellow present and Claire gets Bob's purple present.

Finally, Alice and Bob swap presents.  So, Alice gets Bob's purple present and Bob gets Alice's yellow present.

So, at the end, Alice has the purple present! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Claire and Bob swap balls.  That means Claire starts with the yellow ball, and Bob starts with the brown ball.

Then Alice and Claire swap.  This means Alice starts with the brown ball, and Claire starts with the yellow ball.

Finally, Bob and Claire swap.  This means Bob starts with the yellow ball, and Claire starts with the brown ball.

So, Bob ends up with the brown ball. 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the game!

First, Bob and Alice swap their balls.  Then, Claire and Bob swap their balls. Finally, Bob and Alice swap their balls again. 

This means that the final ball that Alice has is the one that Bob had at the beginning. 


So the answer is **(C) purple ball**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the game:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice starts with a pink ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Alice gets the blue ball and Claire gets the pink ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Bob gets the blue ball.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the orange ball, and Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the blue ball and Bob gets the orange ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the orange ball. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Here's how the books get swapped:

* **Alice starts with Frankenstein:** She gets it first.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Alice's book (Frankenstein) and Alice gets Bob's book (Catch-22).
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Claire gets Alice's book (Catch-22) and Alice gets Claire's book (Ulysses).

So, at the end, Bob has Ulysses. 

**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles at the end! 

Here's why:

* **First swap:** Claire and Bob trade books. This means Claire gets Ulysses and Bob gets The Pearl.
* **Second swap:** Alice and Bob trade books. This means Alice gets The Pearl and Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Third swap:** Claire and Alice trade books. This means Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles and Alice gets Ulysses.

"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Bob starts with a blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a blue ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the blue ball. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* Alice and Bob switch partners first.
* Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.
* Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners again.

This means that after the first switch, Alice and Bob are now dancing with different partners.  Then, Claire takes Alice's spot, and then Alice and Bob switch partners again. 

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Bob.

"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Alice and Bob switch:**  Alice is now with Jamie, and Bob is with Melissa.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire is now with Rodrigo, and Bob is with Alice.

Since Bob switched partners twice, he is now dancing with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Alice starts as a left midfielder.  Then, she and Claire switch positions.  Then, Bob and Alice switch positions.  Finally, Claire and Alice switch positions again.  So, Alice ends up playing fullback. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Alice starts with The Odyssey.  Then Bob and Claire swap books.  Then Claire and Alice swap books.  Finally, Bob and Claire swap books again.  So, at the end of the semester, Alice has The Fellowship of the Ring. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is on the right, and Claire is on the right wing.
* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire moves to the right midfielder, and Alice moves to the right wing.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the center midfielder, and Bob moves to the right wing.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the right wing! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Bob gets The Pearl at the end! 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire swap books first.  
* Then, Claire and Alice swap books. 
* Finally, Bob and Claire swap books again. 


So, Bob ends up with The Pearl. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Here's how the gifts end up:

* **Start:** Alice (pink), Bob (orange), Claire (white)
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch gifts.  We don't know who gets which gift, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch gifts. Again, we don't know who gets which gift, but we know the order is important.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they switch gifts again.

**The answer is (B) white present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades!

* **Start:** Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Moby Dick*, and Claire has *Catch-22*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They trade, so Claire gets *Moby Dick* and Bob gets *Catch-22*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  They trade again, so Alice gets *Catch-22* and Bob gets *Moby Dick*.

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Finally, they trade, so Claire gets *Moby Dick* and Alice gets *Catch-22*.

So, at the end of the semester, Claire has *The Odyssey*. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is now dancing with Claire.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Claire, and Claire is now dancing with Bob.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Bob is now dancing with Alice, and Alice is now dancing with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Bob**. 



"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire swap gifts.  This means Bob gets Claire's red present and Claire gets Bob's pink ball.
* **Second swap:** Alice and Claire swap gifts. This means Alice gets Claire's red present and Claire gets Alice's green present.
* **Third swap:** Alice and Bob swap gifts. This means Alice gets Bob's pink ball and Bob gets Alice's green present.

So, at the end, Alice has the green present. 


The answer is **(C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Start:** Alice is with Patrick, Bob is with Karl, and Claire is with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  They switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Patrick.
* **Alice and Claire switch:**  They switch partners again, so Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is now with Patrick.

"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Bob and Alice swap gifts.  That means Bob gets Alice's pink ball, and Alice gets Bob's white present. 

Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  This means Claire gets Bob's white present, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.

Finally, Alice and Claire swap gifts.  This means Alice gets Claire's orange ball, and Claire gets Alice's pink ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the orange ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Claire ends up with the orange ball. Here's why:

"Here's how the books get traded:

1. **Start:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *The Pearl*, and Claire has *The Odyssey*.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets *The Pearl* and Bob gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

3. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets *The Odyssey* and Claire gets *The Pearl*.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  Bob gets *The Pearl* and Alice gets *The Odyssey*.

**So, at the end of the semester, Claire has The Pearl.**

"Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire now dances with Bob.
2. **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Claire now dances with Bob, and Alice now dances with Claire.
3. **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire now dances with Sam, and Bob now dances with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Sam**.

"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves!

* **First, Claire and Alice switch partners.**  This means Claire is now with Patrick, and Alice is with Helga.
* **Then, Bob and Claire switch partners.** This means Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is with Ophelia.
* **Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners again.** This means Claire is now with Bob, and Alice is with Ophelia.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Bob**.

"Bob ends up with the brown ball.  Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Alice and Bob swap balls.  
* **Step 2:** Bob and Claire swap balls.
* **Step 3:** Alice and Bob swap balls again. 


Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is with Rodrigo.
2. **Alice and Claire switch:** This means Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is with Rodrigo.
3. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now with Claire, and Bob is with Ophelia.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with **Claire**. 


"
"Alice ends up with the pink ball! Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Alice and Claire swap their balls.
* **Step 2:** Bob and Alice swap their balls.
* **Step 3:** Alice and Claire swap their balls again. 

Let me know if you'd like to play another game! 
"
"Okay, so we have Alice, Bob, and Claire.  They're doing a gift exchange, and they're all starting with different colors.

First, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  Then, Bob and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Claire and Bob swap gifts again.  

The question is: at the end, who has the blue present? 

The answer is **(B) Claire**. 



"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire swap.  This means Claire starts with a blue present, and Bob starts with a white present.
* **Second swap:** Claire and Alice swap. This means Alice starts with a pink ball, and Claire starts with a blue present.
* **Third swap:** Claire and Bob swap. This means Bob starts with a white present, and Claire starts with a blue present.

So, Claire ends up with the blue present. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means Alice takes Bob's spot.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places again.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Karl. 


The answer is **(A) Karl.** 
"
"Here's how the balls end up:

* **Alice starts with a pink ball.**
* **Bob starts with a brown ball.**
* **Claire starts with a white ball.**

Alice and Claire swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Claire gets the pink ball.

"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is on the right wing, Bob is the left midfielder, and Claire is in the center.
* **First Trade:** Claire and Alice switch places.  So now Alice is in the center, and Claire is on the right wing.
* **Second Trade:** Bob and Alice switch places.  Now Bob is in the center, and Alice is on the left wing.
* **Third Trade:** Claire and Bob switch places again.  This means Claire is now on the left wing, and Bob is in the center.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing **center midfielder**.

"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Alice and Bob switch:**  Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is now with Alice.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Claire, and Claire is now with Bob.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice is now with Claire, and Claire is now with Alice.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Claire. 


**Answer: (C) Jamie** 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Bob and Alice switch:**  This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Rodrigo.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire now dances with Alice, and Bob now dances with Ophelia.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with **Ophelia**. 


 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Alice starts as striker.**
* **Bob is the benchwarmer.**
* **Claire is the center midfielder.**

Then Alice and Bob switch places.  So, Alice is now the benchwarmer, and Bob is the striker.

"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the striker, Bob is the center midfielder, and Claire is the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire moves to striker, and Bob moves to left midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire moves to center midfielder, and Alice moves to left midfielder.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob moves to left midfielder, and Claire moves to striker.

So, at the end of the game, Claire is playing striker! 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Claire and Alice swap gifts.  That means Claire gets Bob's brown present, and Alice gets Claire's white present. 

Then, Bob and Claire swap gifts.  This means Bob gets Claire's white present, and Claire gets Bob's brown present.

Finally, Alice and Bob swap gifts.  This means Alice gets Bob's brown present, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.

So, Bob ends up with the blue present! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Here's how the gifts change hands:

* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets Claire's brown present, and Claire gets Alice's blue present.

Since Alice started with a blue present, and then received a brown present from Claire, and then received an orange ball from Bob, Alice will end up with the **orange ball**.

"Claire ends up dancing with Rodrigo because of the last switch! 

Here's why:

* Alice and Claire switch partners first.
* Then Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 


So, Claire ends up with Rodrigo. 

The answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the right midfielder, and Claire is the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice switch again:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the right midfielder! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **First:** Alice is with Rodrigo, Bob is with Melissa, and Claire is with Jamie.
* **Then:** Bob and Claire switch partners.
* **Next:** Alice and Bob switch partners.
* **Finally:** Bob and Claire switch partners again.

This means that after all the switching, Claire is dancing with Jamie. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Here's how the dance partners change:

* **Bob and Alice switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners again:** This means they swap places again.

Since Bob and Alice switch partners twice, and they start with Bob and Alice, the final dance partner for Alice is **Melissa**.

"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Claire and Alice swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  Finally, Alice and Claire swap gifts again. 

This means that the gifts are being swapped around, so the person who has the gift at the end will be the one who started with the gift that was swapped to them. 

So, the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's break down the game:

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a red ball. They swap, so Alice gets the red ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire starts with a black ball, and Bob now has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the red ball, and Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Claire gets the red ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the **red ball**. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so here's how the gift exchange works:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's.
2. **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Claire's, and Claire's present becomes Alice's.

So, after the swaps, Claire has Alice's present. 

**The answer is (C) green present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Start:** Alice is with Jamie, Bob is with Karl, and Claire is with Patrick.
* **Claire and Bob switch:**  This means Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Alice and Claire switch:**  This means Alice and Claire switch partners.

Now, we need to figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end. 

**Answer:**  Alice is dancing with Bob. 


"
"Alice starts with the book ""Lolita"".  

Then, Alice and Claire swap books.  This means Alice gives Claire her book and Claire gives Alice her book. 

Then, Bob and Alice swap books. This means Bob gets Alice's book and Alice gets Bob's book. 

So, at the end of the semester, Alice has ""Catch-22"". 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so here's how the gift exchange works:

1. **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has red, and Claire has orange.
2. **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets red, Bob gets orange.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets red, Claire gets blue.
4. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets blue, Alice gets orange.

So, at the end, Alice has the orange ball! 

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions on the soccer field:

* **Goalkeeper:**  The person who protects the goal.
* **Left Midfielder:**  Plays in the middle of the field on the left side.
* **Fullback:**  Plays on the outside of the defense, usually on the sides.

Alice started as the goalkeeper, then Bob moved to the goalkeeper position, and then Claire moved to the fullback position. 

So, at the end of the match, Alice is playing **left midfielder**.

"Claire is dancing with Sam! 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice switch:**  This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Sam.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire now dances with Sam.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** This means Alice now dances with Bob, and Claire now dances with Sam. 



 
"
"Bob is dancing with Sam! 

Here's why:

* Alice and Claire switched partners first.

"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

1. **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is now dancing with Ophelia.
2. **Alice and Claire switch partners:** This means Alice is now dancing with Bob, and Claire is now dancing with Karl.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Karl. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so here's how it works:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with an orange ball, and Claire starts with a brown present. They swap, so Claire now has the orange ball and Alice has the brown present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob starts with a black ball, and Claire now has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob now has the orange ball and Claire has the black ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire has the black ball, and Alice has the orange ball. They swap, so Alice now has the black ball and Claire has the orange ball.

So, Claire ends up with the orange ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Here's how the books get traded:

* Alice starts with Frankenstein.
* Bob starts with The Odyssey.
* Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.

Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Claire gets Frankenstein.

Alice and Bob swap books, so Alice gets The Odyssey and Bob gets The Great Gatsby.

So, at the end of the semester, Bob has The Great Gatsby. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Alice ends up with the green ball. Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Bob and Alice swap.  Alice gets the black ball, and Bob gets the green ball.
* **Step 2:** Claire and Alice swap. Alice gets the black ball, and Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Step 3:** Alice and Bob swap. Alice gets the blue ball, and Bob gets the green ball. 


Let me know if you have any other word problems!

"Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. Here's why:

* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Claire and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Alice and Claire switch:**  Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is with Sam.
2. **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire is now with Sam, and Bob is with Melissa.
3. **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice is now with Jamie, and Bob is with Melissa.

"Here's how the books get traded:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Bob: The Pearl
    * Claire: The Odyssey

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they both get each other's books.
    * Bob gets The Odyssey
    * Claire gets The Pearl

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means they both get each other's books.
    * Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Alice gets The Pearl

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Alice and Bob swap gifts.  Alice gets Bob's red present, and Bob gets Alice's blue present. 

Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  Claire gets Bob's red present, and Bob gets Claire's green present.

Finally, Alice and Claire swap gifts.  Alice gets Claire's green present, and Claire gets Alice's red present.

So, Bob ends up with the green present! 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

First, Claire and Alice swap gifts.  That means Claire's present (pink) becomes Alice's present (yellow).

Then, Alice and Bob swap gifts.  This means Alice's present (yellow) becomes Bob's present (red).

Finally, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  This means Claire's present (yellow) becomes Bob's present (pink).

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Claire ends up with the blue ball! Here's why:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a pink ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the blue ball.

"Alice ends up with the green ball! Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Alice and Claire swap.  Alice gets the green ball, and Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Step 2:** Alice and Bob swap. Alice gets the blue ball, and Bob gets the green ball.
* **Step 3:** Alice and Claire swap. Alice gets the blue ball, and Claire gets the green ball. 


Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Claire ends up with the blue ball. Here's why:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a green ball. They swap, so now Claire has the blue ball and Alice has the green ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the green ball, and Bob has the black ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the blue ball, and Alice has the green ball. 



 
"
"Alice starts as the goalkeeper.  Then Bob switches places with Alice, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper.  Then Alice switches places with Claire, so Alice is now the center midfielder.  Finally, Alice and Bob switch places again, so Bob is now the center midfielder and Alice is the goalkeeper. 


So the answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Start:** Claire is with Bob.
* **Switch 1:** Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Switch 2:** Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means that after the first switch, Claire is now with someone else.  Then, after the second switch, Alice is with someone else.  

The final dance is Bob and Claire. 



**Answer:** (A) Patrick. 
"
"Claire ends up with the pink ball. Here's why:

* **Think about the swaps:**  The game is about swapping balls.  
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with the red ball, and Bob starts with the green ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice starts with the red ball, and Claire starts with the pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire starts with the pink ball, and Bob starts with the green ball.

"Alice gets The Pearl at the end of the semester. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire swap books. This means they both get each other's books.
* Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring. 
* Bob gets The Pearl. 
* Alice gets The Pearl. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's break it down:

* **First switch:** Alice and Bob switch partners.  
* **Second switch:** Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Final switch:** Alice and Bob switch partners.

This means that after the first switch, Bob is with Claire, and Alice is with Rodrigo. After the second switch, Claire is with Alice, and Bob is with Rodrigo.  Finally, after the last switch, Alice is with Claire, and Bob is with Rodrigo. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Claire ends up with the blue ball. Here's why:

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice starts with a brown ball, and Bob starts with a red ball. They swap, so Alice gets the red ball and Bob gets the brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the brown ball, and Claire has the red ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the red ball, and Bob has the brown ball. 



Let me know if you have any other word problems! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Bob starts with a blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a blue ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the blue ball. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Alice starts with a white present.  Then, she and Bob swap presents.  After that, Claire and Alice swap presents.  Finally, Bob and Alice swap presents again.  

So, Alice ends up with the blue present. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this gift swap!

First, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  Then Bob and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Bob and Claire swap gifts again.  

Since we know Bob started with an orange ball, and then swapped with Claire, and then with Alice, we can figure out the final result. 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have Alice, Bob, and Claire.  They start with a red, black, and white present, right?  

The first swap is between Bob and Alice.  Then, Claire and Bob swap.  Finally, Alice and Claire swap.  

Think about it like this:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch their gifts.  
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch their gifts.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  They switch their gifts.

The order of the swaps matters!  

Let's think about what happens if we swap gifts in a specific order.  If we swap gifts in a specific order, we can figure out who has what. 



 
"
"Bob ends up with the pink ball! Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire starts with the pink ball, and Alice starts with the yellow ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob has the yellow ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Bob now has the pink ball, and Claire has the blue ball. 


So the answer is (A). 
"
"Here's how the swapping works:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's purple ball, and Bob gets Alice's white ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Claire gets Bob's purple ball, and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.

Since Bob ends up with the pink ball, and Alice ends up with the white ball, the answer is **(A) white ball**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Then Claire and Bob switch partners.

"The person who made the first system for naming plants and animals is Carl Linnaeus!  He's called the ""father of taxonomy.""  He came up with a way to group all living things and give them names.  That's really important for scientists to be able to understand all the different kinds of plants and animals. 
 
Here's why:

* **Linnaeus's system is called Linnaean taxonomy.**  It's like a big family tree for all living things. 
* **He also made a special way to name each living thing called binomial nomenclature.**  This means each animal or plant has a two-part name, like a scientific name.

"The song ""Another Way to Die"" for the James Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"" was made by Jack White. 

Here's why:
