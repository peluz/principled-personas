Let's see, Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That's a total of $130,000 invested.

The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than before.

Adding that to the original value, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Subtracting his investment from the final value, Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Let's think about this like a merchant calculating his goods.

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more.  She sold a third at the green house, then a few more at the red house, and then half of what was left at the orange house.

To figure out how many she began with, we need to work backwards.

She had 5 left, and that's after selling half at the orange house, so before the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10.

Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12.

And before the green house, she had 12 * 3 = 36.



So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners.

Let's break this problem down. The ratio 7:11 tells us that for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

If their combined age is 162, we need to figure out how many of these ""ratio units"" make up their ages.  

* Add the ratio parts: 7 + 11 = 18
* Divide the total age by the sum of the ratio parts: 162 / 18 = 9.

This means each ""ratio unit"" is equal to 9 years.

* Darrell's age: 7 * 9 = 63 years old
* Allen's age: 11 * 9 = 99 years old

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10: 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses, which is 3: 240 divided by 3 equals 80.

Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah earned $100, Adrien earned $130. We know Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, so that's his $130.

To find Lylah's original salary, we divide Adrien's salary by 1.3 (100% + 30%): $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his increase was $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000. His new salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, which is $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 (approximately). Her new salary is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

Kelly runs much farther than Blake. She runs back and forth across the whole field once, which is 100 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That is like running 80 yards each time, so she runs 34 times 80 yards, which equals 2720 yards. In total, Kelly runs 100 yards plus 2720 yards, which is 2820 yards.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, covering 100 yards each time, for a total of 1500 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

Let's think about this problem. Both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is changing because of the initial amounts they had.

If the big pool had twice the water of the small pool four minutes ago, and now it has four times the water, that means the big pool lost less water in those four minutes compared to the small pool.

Since they both leak at the same rate, the big pool must have started with more water.  

Let's say the small pool has 'S' gallons now. The big pool has '4S' gallons now. Four minutes ago, the big pool had '4S + 16' gallons, and the small pool had 'S + 16' gallons.

We know that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool. So:

4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)

Solving for S, we get:

To know how many vines Steve needs, we must first find out how many tomatoes they need in total each week. Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that amount, which is 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day.

Over a week, they need 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. Therefore, Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, meaning Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age back then, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

If there are twice as many players on offense as defense, and half as many on special teams as defense, we can think of it like this:

* **Defense:**  Let's say there are *d* players on defense.
* **Offense:** There are 2*d* players on offense.
* **Special Teams:** There are *d*/2 players on special teams.

In total, there are *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105 players.

But 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and another 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans. That means 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

To find out how much weaker the coffee is, we must first see how many ice cubes are needed. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so 65 degrees of cooling requires 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Let's break down this problem. We know the company has 100 employees, and 2/5 of them are junior programmers. That means there are 40 junior programmers (100 * 2/5 = 40).

Each junior programmer earns $2000, so the total cost for junior programmers is $80,000 (40 * $2000 = $80,000).

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, making their salary $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers (100 - 40 = 60), the total cost for them is $144,000 (60 * $2400 = $144,000).

Adding the cost of junior and senior programmers, the company pays a total of $224,000 per month ($80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000).

* In the second year, the price drops by 25%, meaning each share decreases by $12 * 0.25 = $3.

All together, that's 2x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200.

Adding 10 to both sides, we have 3x = 210.

That means there are 60 animals * (2/3) = 40 chickens.

If there are 40 chickens, there must be 60 animals - 40 chickens = 20 cows.

Now, we count the legs. 20 cows have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

The chickens have 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.

In total, the animals have 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs.

Let's see... the ratio is 5:6, meaning for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  If they have 165 popsicles in total, we need to figure out how many more Sam has.

We can think of the popsicles as being divided into 11 parts (5 + 6). Each part is worth 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Hulu and Disney Plus together would normally cost $20, but he gets a discount for bundling, so it's $20 minus 20%, which is $4 off. That makes the bundle $16.

For 80 rooms, we multiply: 15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces.

To find out when the cost is the same, we need to think about how much each venue will cost with different numbers of guests.

The first place costs $200 no matter what, plus $5 for each guest's food. The second place costs $25 for each guest, and that includes food.

We need to find the number of guests where these two costs are equal.  Let's say there are 'x' guests.

* **First place cost:** $200 + $5x
* **Second place cost:** $25x

We want to know when these two amounts are the same, so we set them equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for 'x'. Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10

Let's see... they found 43 insects in total. David found half of what Bodhi found, and Lily found 7 more than David.  To figure out how many Lily found, we need to think step by step.

First, let's think about David and Bodhi. If David found half of what Bodhi found, we need to divide the total insects by 3 (since there are three of them). That's 43 / 3 = 14 with a remainder.  Since we can't have parts of insects, we know Bodhi must have found a number that, when divided by 2, gives us a whole number for David's insects.

Let's try a few numbers. If Bodhi found 18 insects, David would have found 9 (18 / 2 = 9). That adds up to 27 insects so far.

That means Lily found 16 insects (43 - 27 = 16).

"By Allah's grace, this is a simple matter of proportions.  If the jar holds 4500 sweets, and the green are 1% more than the blue, while the red are 1% less, we can find the balance.

Let's calculate Ashley's internet speed.

First, we need to convert her speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s).  There are 1000 kilobits in one megabit, so:

20 kb/s / 1000 kb/Mb = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, to find her speed in megabits per hour (Mb/h), we multiply by the number of seconds in an hour:

0.02 Mb/s * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72 Mb/h

Let's break down this car sales problem.  

First, we find the total cost the company paid for the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.

Then, we figure out how much the company spent to buy all the cars: $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

Next, we calculate the total money made from selling the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.

Now, we subtract the company's cost from the total sales to find the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets 10% of the profit as his commission: $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500.

Let's see... we have two twins and three triplets. One twin is older than one of the triplets by seven years, and all together their ages add up to 44. To find the age of one of the twins, we need to think carefully.

If we think of the triplets as a group, their combined age is like that of three people.  We know one twin is older than one triplet by seven years, so we can think of the twins' ages as being like the ages of two people, but one of them is seven years older.

Let's say the youngest triplet is 'x' years old. Then the older twin is 'x + 7' years old. The other twin is the same age as the older twin, so they are also 'x + 7' years old.

Now, the combined age of all of them is 44, so:

x + x + x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) = 44

Combining like terms:

5x + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5x = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 6

So the youngest triplet is 6 years old. This means the older twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

Let's see... Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He bought some more, and now he has twice as many orange as white.  

If we say he bought 'w' white fish, he must have bought 17 - w orange fish.

That means he has 3 + (17 - w) orange fish and 4 + w white fish.

We know the orange are twice the white, so: 3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Solving for 'w', we find that w = 4.

Let us consider this problem. Claire earns one badge each month. Amber takes twice as long, meaning she earns a badge every two months. In a year, she would earn 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire, so she earns 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges per month. In a year, she earns 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

Let us use wisdom to solve this.

If we say Fawn has F books, then Anne has F - 12 books, and Sofie has F + 13 books.

Together they have 85 books, so F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85.

This means 3F + 1 = 85.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F = 84.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find F = 28.

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

This is a good problem to test our understanding of distance, speed, and time. Let's break it down:

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles. At a speed of 2 miles per hour, this takes him 6 hours (12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours).

He then rests for half the time he swam, so 3 hours (6 hours / 2 = 3 hours).

The remaining distance is 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles).  Since he swims at half his original speed, he travels at 1 mile per hour (2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour).

This last part takes him 8 hours (8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours).

Adding up all the times, we get a total of 17 hours (6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours).

Let's figure this out.  If Bahati scored the most, and scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some simple math.

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, they scored x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45 points.

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5.


So Azibo scored 5 points.

"As-salamu alaykum! This problem requires a bit of careful calculation. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out the total percentage of charge lost.  The power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours, which is a total of 9 * 5 = 45%

Then, it lost another 7% per hour for 3 hours, meaning an additional 7 * 3 = 21% loss.

In total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.

This means that 34% of the charge remained (100% - 66% = 34%).

We know that after this, only 28% remained, meaning 34% - 28% = 6% was used by Maria's friends.

This 6% represents the portion of the 34% that was left after the initial losses. To find the original charge, we can set up a proportion:

6% / 34% = x / 100%

Solving for x, we get: x = (6% * 100%) / 34% = 17.65% (approximately)



Therefore, the power bank was approximately 17.65% charged when Maria went to the park.

Let's see... Teresa sells the big animals for three times the price of the small ones. She sold twice as many small ones as big ones and made $120. Each small one costs $4.  

To find out how many small ones she sold, we need to think carefully.  

If we say she sold 'x' big animals, she sold 2x small animals. The big animals each cost $12, so she made 12x dollars from them. The small animals each cost $4, so she made 8x dollars from them. Altogether, she made 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 20x = $120.  

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small animals.

If the first person got 'x' dollars, the second got 'x + $80', and the third got '2 * (x + $80)' which is '2x + $160'.

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x's, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

* He has 8 classes a day (6 normal + 2 extra) at 40 minutes each, totaling 320 minutes daily.
* That's 1600 minutes in a week (320 minutes/day * 5 days).
* He spends another 100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday learning, for a total of 200 minutes.
* Adding it all up, John spends 1800 minutes learning each week.
* Converting that to hours, we get 30 hours (1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour).

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The 33-degree water contributes 132 ""degree-ounces"" (33 degrees * 4 ounces).  To make the mix at least 40 degrees, the second mug needs to add enough ""degree-ounces"" to make up the difference.

Let's say the second mug is 'x' degrees. It contributes x ""degree-ounces"" (x degrees * 1 ounce).

The total ""degree-ounces"" in the mix must be at least 200 (40 degrees * 5 ounces).

Masha'Allah, avocado trees are truly a blessing.  

Let's see, a 5-year-old tree gives 50 fruits. A 6-year-old gives three times that, so 150. A 7-year-old gives seven times the initial amount, which is 350. An 8-year-old gives 200 less than a 10-year-old, and a 10-year-old gives 20 times the initial amount, which is 1000. So, the 8-year-old gives 800.

Adding all these up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

Alhamdulillah, that's a lot of avocados!

Let's break this problem down. We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters, we can figure out the length of the red rope.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's say the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times longer, so it's 4 * b centimeters long.
*  The yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, so it's b + 7 centimeters long.

Now, if we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 5

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

With four bedrooms, that's 960 square feet total (240 * 4 = 960). The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, making it 1200 square feet (240 * 5 = 1200).

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 2160 square feet (960 + 1200 = 2160). Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 3160 square feet (2160 + 1000 = 3160).

Let's break down this problem. We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age both now and in the future.  

We can use algebra to solve this. Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

From the problem, we get these equations:

* w = 5(c + 7) 
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can solve for ""c"" (Colin's current age) using these equations.

Solving the first equation for ""w"", we get:

* w = 5c + 35

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

* c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

* c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* 75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
* 40/3 = (2/3)c
* c = (40/3) * (3/2)
* c = 20

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To find the percentage, we do (3600 divided by 6000) times 100. That gives us 60%.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 oranges - 15 oranges = 5 more oranges than Jane.

Let's see, Mark got a good deal on that radiator. 80% off is a blessing! So, the radiator cost him $80.  The mechanic charged $150 for the installation. That means Mark paid a total of $230.

"By Allah's grace, this is a simple matter of counting.  If we have 20 animals with 70 legs, we know there must be more cows than chickens.  Let us think:

* Each chicken has two legs.
* Each cow has four legs.

We can figure this out by trying different numbers. If we have 5 chickens, that is 10 legs. That leaves 60 legs for the cows. 60 divided by 4 legs per cow means there are 15 cows.

5 chickens + 15 cows = 20 animals.
