Let's break it down:

Melanie's sales follow a pattern: a third here, a fixed amount there, and then half of what's remaining.  To figure out her starting point, we need to work backward from her final inventory.

Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that represents what's left *after* selling half to the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house sale.

Adding the 2 she sold to the red house, we see she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before that sale.

Finally, since the red house purchase represented a fixed amount, and she had 12 before that sale, her initial inventory must have been 12 * 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners.

"Ah, a classic coin puzzle!  While I specialize in ancient numismatics, the principles of counting hold true across the ages. 

Let's break it down:

We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

If we think of the silver coins as our base, and the gold coins as that base plus 30, we can set up a simple equation.

Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.

* Silver coins: x
* Gold coins: x + 30

Total coins: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

* Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, meaning Lylah earned 100/130ths of Adrien's salary.

* Adrien's salary increased by 40% over those four years.

To find their combined salary four years later, we need to calculate both of their salaries at that time.

Let's assume Lylah's salary four years ago was represented by 'x'. Adrien's salary would then be 1.3x. We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so 1.3x = $40,000.

Solving for x, we find Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Adrien's salary four years later would be $40,000 + (40/100)*$40,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary four years later would be $30,769.23 + (40/100)*$30,769.23 = $43,076.92.

We know the total bee population is 700.  The problem states there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. This creates a nice, structured hierarchy.

Thinking in terms of ratios can be helpful. If we represent the number of queen bees as 1, then there are 2 baby bees for every queen bee, and 4 worker bees for every queen bee.

This means the total ratio of queen bees to baby bees to worker bees is 1:2:4.

Adding those ratios together (1 + 2 + 4 = 7), we see that each ""part"" of the ratio represents 100 bees (700 bees / 7 parts = 100 bees per part).

Since worker bees represent 4 parts of the ratio, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"Ah, a tale of pilfering and persistence! While my expertise lies in deciphering ancient texts, not tracking pilfered snacks, I can apply a bit of logic to this culinary conundrum.

Let's work backward:

* Five fries remained after the ants had their share.
* Before the ants, there were six (five plus the one they took).
* The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries before that, meaning six fries represent one-third.
* Therefore, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.
* The pigeons ate nine fries, leaving 18 + 9 = 27 fries.
* The seagull consumed half of Dave's fourteen fries, meaning it ate seven.
*  Adding Dave's fourteen and the seagull's seven, we find there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries initially.

 
Thus, the pack contained **21** fries when Dave first purchased it.

Here's how we can solve this:

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  We're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which is 9 feet).  

Let's find the width:

* Area = length * width
* 360 square feet = 9 feet * width
* width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now, the perimeter is twice the sum of the length and width:

* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
* Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)
* Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet
* Perimeter = 98 feet

"Ah, geometry! A subject deeply intertwined with the architectural marvels of ancient civilizations.  

While my expertise lies in historical analysis, I recall that the angles within a triangle always sum to 180 degrees.  If one angle is twice the smallest and another is three times the smallest, we can deduce the measure of the largest angle.

Let's represent the smallest angle as 'x'. The other angles would then be 2x and 3x.  Adding these together, we get x + 2x + 3x = 180.

Combining like terms, we have 6x = 180. Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 30.

Therefore, the largest angle, which is 3x, measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Ah, a classic problem of ratios and proportions!  While my expertise lies in deciphering ancient texts, even I can see the logic here. 

If Janey possesses 21 books, and that number represents three more than twice the amount Sally has, we can deduce Sally's book count.  Let's think of it this way:

*  Janey's books = 2 * (Sally's books) + 3

We know Janey's books equal 21, so:

* 21 = 2 * (Sally's books) + 3

Solving for Sally's books, we get:

* 18 = 2 * (Sally's books)
* 9 = Sally's books



Sally has **9** books.

"Ah, a classic problem of proportions!  While my expertise lies in historical analysis, even I can appreciate a good mathematical puzzle. 

Let's break it down:

* We know 25% of the plants are indoors, leaving 75% for outdoor and flowering varieties.
* Two-thirds of that remaining 75% are outdoors, meaning the remaining third must be flowering.

Therefore, one-third of 75% represents the flowering plants.  Calculating that out, we find 25% of the total plants are flowering.

"Ah, a classic problem of optimization!  While my expertise lies in the annals of history, even I can appreciate a good logistical puzzle.  

Let's break it down. We need to figure out how many more plants Pat needs, then multiply that by the cost per plant.  

First, we need to convert the flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants).

Dividing the total length by the space per plant gives us 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she'll need 45 in total.

Pat already has 17, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants.

Finally, 28 plants * $6/plant = $168.

* This means a total of 66% of the charge was lost (45% + 21% = 66%).

If 66% was lost, and 28% remains, the power bank must have been at 94% when Maria left for the park (100% - 66% = 34%, and 34% + 28% = 62%, and 100% - 62% = 38%).

"Ah, a classic geometry problem!  While my expertise lies in the annals of history, even I can appreciate a good calculation. 

To determine the amount of fabric needed, we must first consider the dimensions of the comforter.  Since it needs to be 2 feet longer and wider than the bed, we add 4 feet to both the length and width.

* Length: 6 feet + 4 feet = 10 feet
* Width: 8 feet + 4 feet = 12 feet

The area of the comforter is then calculated by multiplying the length and width:

* Area: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet

"Ah, a problem of division! This reminds me of the ancient practice of sharing spoils after a successful hunt.  

Let's see... they divided $1920. The second person received $80 more than the first, and the third received twice the amount of the second. To find the first person's share, we can set up an equation. Let 'x' be the first person's share.

The second person received x + $80, and the third received 2(x + $80).  The total is x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920.

Simplifying, we get 4x + $240 = $1920.

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680.

"Ah, a classic problem of mixtures!  While I specialize in ancient civilizations, the principles of heat and temperature have been understood for centuries.

To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the following:

* The final mixture must be at least 40 degrees.
* The 33-degree water will cool the mixture down.
* The unknown water must be hot enough to compensate for the cooling effect of the 33-degree water.

Since we're dealing with a small amount of water, we can simplify the calculation by focusing on the ""degree-ounces"" contributed by each mug.

The 33-degree water contributes 33 degrees * 4 ounces = 132 ""degree-ounces"".

Let 'x' represent the temperature of the second mug. It contributes x degrees * 1 ounce = x ""degree-ounces"".

The total ""degree-ounces"" in the mixture will be 132 + x.

To achieve an average temperature of at least 40 degrees in the 5-ounce mixture, we have:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

Solving for x, we get:

132 + x >= 200
x >= 68

Therefore, the second mug must be at least **68 degrees**.

"Ah, a classic tale of amphibious travel!  While my expertise lies in the annals of history, even I can appreciate a good distance-rate-time problem. 

Let's break it down: Phineas travels 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.  

On land, he hops at a brisk 20 yards per minute, so that leg of the journey takes 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

In the water, he swims at a more leisurely 10 yards per minute, making that leg take 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those times together, we find Phineas's total return trip takes 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.
