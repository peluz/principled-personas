"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, Josh bought the house for $80,000 and dumped another $50,000 into fixing it up. That's a total of $130,000 invested.

The repairs boosted the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he paid for it.

Adding that increase to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Subtract his total investment from the final value, and Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

* She has 20 chickens, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups total.
* She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
*  She needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 more cups.

Then, she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before that.

Finally, she sold a third of her original amount to the green house.  That means two-thirds of her starting amount is 12, so she started with 12 / (2/3) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

Let's break this down.  If Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio, and their combined age is 162, we can figure out their individual ages.

Think of the ratio like splitting 162 into 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18). Each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Let's break this down. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and we know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can think of it like this:

* **Let 'x' be the number of silver coins.**
* **Gold coins would then be 'x + 30'.**

Since the total number of coins is 110, we can set up an equation:

* **x + (x + 30) = 110**

Combining like terms:

* **2x + 30 = 110**

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

* **2x = 80**

Dividing both sides by 2:

* **x = 40**

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70**

So, Luke's sandcastle is pretty cool.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can figure out the size of each level and then find the average.

The third level would be 32 square feet (16 x 2), the second level would be 64 square feet (32 x 2), and the bottom level would be 128 square feet (64 x 2).

Adding up all the levels, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

"Hey there!  To figure this out, we gotta add up all the pages Solo needs to read and then subtract the pages he already finished. That gives us the total pages left. Then, we divide that by the number of days he has left.

He already read 15, so 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

He has 4 days left, so 24 / 4 = 6 pages per day.

Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  We know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she's rowing at a speed of 1.25 feet per second.

To reach the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, meaning she rows a total of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet, the boat takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so he's now making $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so she's now making $30,769.23 + (0.40 * $30,769.23) = $43,076.92.

Let's break this down. If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees, we can think of it like this:

* For every 1 queen bee, there are 2 baby bees.
* For every 1 queen bee, there are 4 worker bees (2 baby bees * 2 worker bees per baby bee).

So, if we think of the hive as groups of 7 bees (1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers), we can figure out how many groups there are by dividing the total number of bees by 7: 700 bees / 7 bees per group = 100 groups.

Since each group has 4 worker bees, there are 100 groups * 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

There are three numbers on a standard die that are bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one of those.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 25%.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% more likely.

If a flock of ten ducks needs 3.5 pounds of insects each per week, that's a total of 35 pounds for the whole flock.  To figure out how much they need each day, we divide that by 7 days in a week.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Tom starts with 50 trees and adds 10 each year for 10 years, so that's 100 more trees (10 * 10 = 100). But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 * 10 = 20).

That means he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 100 - 20 = 130).

Uh oh, 30% of those die. That's 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).

* The two bigger groups have a combined total of 2 * (group size).
* The smallest group has (group size) - 10.

If we add all the groups together, we get 200 students. So:

2 * (group size) + (group size) - 10 = 200

That means 3 * (group size) - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

3 * (group size) = 210

Since the smallest group is 10 less than the others, it has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of it like this:

* **Cows:** Let's say there are 'x' cows.
* **Chickens:** That means there are '2x' chickens.

Since he has 60 animals total, we can make an equation: x + 2x = 60

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 60.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 20. So there are 20 cows.

That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those up, all the animals have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

Three times the shoplifters got kicked out for fighting, meaning 7 * 3 = 21 people.

That's a total of 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people.

In June, they lost 1/4 of their employees, leaving them with 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees.

That means they paid out $600/week/employee * 30 employees * 4 weeks = $72,000 in June.

James is faster swimming than Jon, but slower on the bike.  Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have made up that time on the run.  

Here's how I'd figure it out:

* **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
* **James's swim:** 40 minutes * 0.90 (10% faster) = 36 minutes
* **James's bike:** 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
* **James's total time:** 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time = 121 minutes + James's run time

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James took 10 minutes longer:

* **James's total time:** 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes

Now we can find James's run time:

* **James's run time:** 160 minutes - 121 minutes = 39 minutes

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, there are 15 red cards, and they tell us there are 60% more green cards. That means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards than red cards.

That gives us a total of 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same amount as the red and green cards combined, so that's 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

That's a total of 150 + 200 = 350 cards! But she keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

* The hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day rate due to the busy weekend, making it $1500 + (0.20 * $1500) = $1800 per day.
* For a 3-day stay, the hotel cost is $1800/day * 3 days = $5400.
* With plane tickets costing $5000 each for Tom and his wife, the total airfare is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and flight costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

Let's say there are 'x' guests.

* Venue 1 cost: $200 + $5x
* Venue 2 cost: $25x

The plane itself cost $150,000. Then, he's got $5000 a month for the hangar and double that for fuel, so that's another $10,000 a month. That's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

"Let's break this down. Sheep have 4 legs, and geese have 2.  If we have a total of 70 legs and 20 heads, we can figure out how many sheep there are.

Think of it like this: each sheep adds 4 legs and 1 head to the total. Each goose adds 2 legs and 1 head.

Let's try some combinations! 

15 sheep would be 60 legs (15 x 4) and 15 heads. That leaves 10 legs for geese (70 - 60) which is just right for 5 geese (10 / 2). And 5 geese plus 15 sheep equals 20 heads!

* **Triplets:**  Let's say each triplet is 'r' years old.
* **Twins:** One twin is 'r + 7' years old, and the other twin is 'r + 7' years old too.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

Combining like terms: 5r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: r = 6

That means each triplet is 6 years old.  

One of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save.

The second amusement park is definitely cheaper.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Park 1:** 2 adults * $26 = $52, plus 2 kids * $12 = $24, for a total of $76.
* **Park 2:** 2 adults * $14 = $28, plus 2 kids * $10 = $20, for a total of $48.

They'd save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Okay, let's break this down. Lorraine's got a lot of sticker-button action going on!

* **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:** She trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since each small sticker gets her 1 small button, and 27 small buttons equal 9 large buttons).

* **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:** She trades half her large stickers, which is 20, for 20 more large buttons.

* **Leftover Large Stickers to Small Buttons:** She has 20 large stickers left. Those get her 60 small buttons (20 x 3 = 60).

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can figure out how many the second house needs. Let's call the number of cases the second house needs ""x"". The first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs double the first, so that's x cases.

Adding those up, we get x/2 + x + x = 250. That simplifies to 2.5x = 250.

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs **100** cases of shingles.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, Mike's got 600 movies. A third of those are in series, which is 200 movies. Since he can get those for a third of the price of a normal movie, that'll be 200 * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves him with 400 movies that aren't in a series.  40% of those are older movies, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest, 240 movies, are newer ones, costing him 240 * $10 = $2400.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his one friend who's a pro gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours straight, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters total.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* PJ's cards = x
* Smendrick's cards = 3x (since he has three times PJ's amount)
* Becca's cards = 3x + 12 (she has 12 more than Smendrick)

Now, we add them all up: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.

To find Peter's age, we can think of it like this:

* **Let's call John's age ""J""**
* **Paul's age is ""J + 10""**
* **Peter's age is ""J + (J + 10)"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10""**

Now, we know:

* **J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100**

Combining like terms:

* **4J + 20 = 100**

Subtract 20 from both sides:

* **4J = 80**

Divide both sides by 4:

* **J = 20**

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

* **Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50**



So, Peter is 50 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down.  The Widgeteer 3000 churns out widgets like nobody's business at 60 an hour. That's 1440 a day, and a whopping 43,200 in a month if it runs non-stop. The WidgetMaster 9000 is a bit slower at 45 an hour, making 1080 a day and 32,400 a month.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 will bring in $259,200 a month ($43,200 x $6), while the WidgetMaster 9000 makes $194,400 ($32,400 x $6).

That means Fern will make $64,800 more each month with the Widgeteer 3000.

"Hey there!  Cameron would save 250 pesos. 

Here's how I figured it out:

* He's staying for 17 hours total.
* The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
* The extra 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
* That brings his total to 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.
* A full 24 hours would have cost him 1600 pesos.
* So, he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Each sheep needs 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay. That means Nate needs 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay for the goats and 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.  In total, he needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

* There are 24 easy questions, and Aries gets 75% of those right, so that's 18 easy questions.
* The other 36 questions are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning 18 of each.
* She gets half of those right, so 9 average and 9 difficult questions correct.

Adding those up, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Let's break this down.  If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones are $4, then large ones are $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine 36 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 1440 pounds per day. Over a month of 30 days, that's 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43200 pounds.

"Let's figure this out.  There's a 50% chance Marcus gets lucky with a sub, so he's off the hook there. If his regular teacher shows up, there's a 40% chance of an extension for everyone. Even if there's no class extension, he's got a 20% shot at faking the dog-ate-my-homework excuse.

So, the only time he *has* to turn it in is if the regular teacher is there, no extension is given, and he can't pull off the dog excuse. That's a 50% chance of the regular teacher *times* a 60% chance of no extension *times* an 80% chance he can't fake it.

* Third person: 2 * (x + $80) = 2x + $160

Adding all their shares together, we get: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

"Alright, let's break this down. Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  She's planning for a 20-year retirement, so she'll need a total of $800,000 ($40,000 x 20).

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $20,000 annually. To reach her $800,000 goal, she'll need to save for 40 years ($800,000 / $20,000).

"Let's break this down. Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

Over three days, he earns $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, that's a total of $82 over three days.

To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we divide his total earnings by his earnings per sunflower: $82 / $8.01 per sunflower = 10.24 sunflowers.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this problem down. We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters, we can figure out the red rope's length.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's call the blue rope ""b"".
* The red rope is ""4b"" (four times the blue rope).
* The yellow rope is ""b + 7"" (7 centimeters longer than the blue rope).

If we add them all up (red + blue + yellow), we get 37 centimeters:

4b + b + (b + 7) = 37

Let's solve for ""b"":

* 6b + 7 = 37
* 6b = 30
* b = 5

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age both now and in the future.  Let's use ""w"" for Wendy's current age and ""c"" for Colin's current age.

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can solve for ""c"" (Colin's current age) using these two equations.

First, let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now, substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down.  John's got a taste for the finer things!

He spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, so each bottle costs $60. Cognac's a bit pricier though - 50% more per bottle. That's an extra $30, bringing the cognac price to $90 a bottle.

Since he buys twice as much cognac, that's 20 bottles at $90 each, totaling $1800.

Adding that to his scotch spending, John shells out a total of $2400.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. On day two, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than day one, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine. That means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on day two.

In total, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees on day one and 30 + 50 = 80 trees on day two.  Adding those together, he planted a grand total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar.  The jar's volume is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches. But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we multiply that by 80% to get 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

If 30% of those are red, that's 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Looks like Tim was off by 864 - 900 = 36 red jelly beans.

"Hey!  To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we gotta find the total length of the fence. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides. That's 20 feet + 15 feet + 20 feet + 15 feet = 70 feet.

"Hey there!  

To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by 2. Emma is 16 years older than Mia, so Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  Their combined age is 40 + 56 = 96 years.  

The average age is 96 / 2 = 48 years old.

"Let's figure this out!

Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed a day (4 pounds twice a day).  That means all five pigs eat 40 pounds a day. Over a week, that's 280 pounds (40 pounds/day * 7 days).

If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 20 pounds left (300 pounds - 280 pounds).

"Hey!  Let's figure this out. John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people eating 2 each, so that's 40 hot dogs total. Since he has 4 leftover, he needs to buy 36 more.  Each pack has 6, so he'll need 6 packs. At $2 a pack, that'll cost him $12.

"Let's break down Frances' earnings and expenses:

* She makes $40 from selling cupcakes (20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake).
* She makes another $40 from selling cookies (40 cookies * $1/cookie).
* That's a total of $80 earned.
* Her trays cost $20 (5 trays * $4/tray).

So, Frances has $60 left ($80 - $20).

"That's easy!  

Here's how it works:

* They start with 5 kids.
* On the second street, each kid brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, or 10 kids.
* On the third street, each kid brings two friends, so that's 10 times 2, or 20 kids.
* But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so we take away 5.

That leaves 15 kids chasing the truck!

"Let's break this down. They make 5000 bars a day and sell each for $2, so that's 5000 * $2 = $10,000 per day.  Over a week, that's $10,000 * 7 = $70,000.  For two weeks, they'd make $70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

The T-shirts are a bit tricky. Since he gets one half off, he pays full price for one ($8) and half price for the other ($8 / 2 = $4). So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are easier. 40% off $40 is $16, so he pays $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Let's break this down. Igor was supposed to bring 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, for a total of 37 items. He only managed to put 29 items on the bench.  He brought half the test tubes, so 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He brought 2 more Petri dishes than requested, meaning he brought 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. That means he brought 8 + 16 = 24 test tubes and Petri dishes in total.  Since he only put 29 items on the bench, he must have lost 37 - 29 = 8 items.  Since he brought the correct number of beakers, he must have lost 8 beakers.

"Hey there!  

To figure out the selling price of each watermelon, we need to find out how much the vendor made in total and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

First, the vendor made a profit of 25% on the $80 he spent, which is $20 (25/100 * $80 = $20).

Adding the profit to the original cost, the vendor sold all the watermelons for $100 ($80 + $20 = $100).

Finally, dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons gives us the price per watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2.

If we had all chickens, that'd be 40 legs.  We need more legs than that, so there have to be some cows.  

Let me think...  

5 chickens would have 10 legs. That leaves 60 legs for the cows. 60 divided by 4 legs per cow is 15 cows.

That adds up to 20 animals!
