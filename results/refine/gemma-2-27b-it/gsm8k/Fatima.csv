"Hey there!  Flipping houses can be tricky, but it sounds like Josh did a good job.  

Here's how I'd figure out his profit:

* First, the repairs increased the house's value by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.
* That means the house was worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000 after the work.
*  Since he spent a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Well, let's see. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day, and she already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them 60 cups in total.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Let's figure this out!

Since every second glass is 60% off, Kylar will pay full price for half the glasses and the discounted price for the other half.  That means he'll pay full price for 8 glasses and the discounted price for the other 8.

* Full price glasses cost: 8 glasses * $5/glass = $40
* Discounted glasses cost: 8 glasses * $3/glass = $24

Adding those together, Kylar will pay a total of $40 + $24 = $64.

So Carla's downloading a big file, 200 GB.  Normally, she gets 2 GB every minute.  But then, ugh, Windows decides to update, right in the middle! That's a 20-minute delay.

Let's see... she was 40% done before the update, so that's 80 GB downloaded already.  That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB per minute).

Now she has to start over, so she needs to download the other 120 GB. That'll take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB per minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

* She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That leaves her with some, and she sells HALF of those at the orange house.
*  If she has 5 left AFTER selling half, she must have had 10 before the orange house.

*  To get to 10, she must have had 12 before the red house (10 + 2).

* And to get to 12, she must have started with 18 (12 x 3 / 2).

*  Think of it like splitting 162 into 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18).

* Each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

* Allen is 11 parts, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

* In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, so that's his $130. To find Lylah's original salary, we divide: $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his raise was $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000. His new salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%, which is $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 (approximately). Her new salary is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, so that's 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards. In total, she runs 100 yards + 2720 yards = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Let's break this down. The price goes up by 20% every two months. That means every two months, the bag of marbles will cost 120% of what it cost before.  

Over 36 months, there are 18 two-month periods.  We need to multiply the original price by 1.20 eighteen times! That's a lot of multiplying, so using a calculator is a good idea.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can think of it like this:

* Brooke's age = 1 part
* Seth's age = 2 parts

In two years, they'll both be older, so we need to add 2 to each of their ages.

* Brooke in two years: 1 part + 2 years
* Seth in two years: 2 parts + 2 years

Together, their ages in two years will be 28, so:

(1 part + 2) + (2 parts + 2) = 28

Combining like terms: 3 parts + 4 = 28

That means 3 parts equals 24 (28 - 4 = 24).

So, one part (Brooke's current age) is 8 (24 / 3 = 8).

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, he's 16 (8 * 2 = 16).

"Hey there!  Lemonade stands are super fun!  

To figure out how much they spent on lemons, we need to think about how much profit they made per gallon. They sell each glass for 50 cents and get 20 glasses per gallon, so that's $10 per gallon.  Since each gallon costs $5 to make, they make a $5 profit on each gallon.

They made $25 total, so they must have sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5).

If each gallon costs $3 for lemons, they spent $15 on lemons in total (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).

"Let's break this down.  If Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens, we know a few things:

* He has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and white chickens lay 5, so the total eggs are 3r + 5w = 42.

We can use these facts to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has. Let's substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the second equation:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying that gives us:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combining like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

r = 4

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That means he's writing and receiving 3 pen pals * 2 letters/pen pal * 2 = 12 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages he writes and receives every week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing each week.

That's 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours of writing!

Adding those extra costs to the selling price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"Hey there!  To figure out the cost, we need to find out how much water the pool holds. That's called the volume.  

The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, so the volume is 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill, the total cost is 120 x $0.10 = $12.00.

If two groups are the same size, and the third is smaller by 10, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, there are 200 students, so:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Let's solve for x:

3x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

Now, to find the size of the smallest group:

x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

Okay, if we think of it like this:

* If there were only cows, there would be 60 / 3 = 20 cows.
* Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

All together, that's 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

To find his total vacation time, we divide the known time (15 hours) by the percentage it represents (30% or 0.30): 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

"Let's see... the train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles one way.  Coming back, it travels 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles. That means a full round trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

To figure out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service miles by the daily miles: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4 people. So he'll need 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so that's 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds of each.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

In total, Tyson will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much the company paid its employees.

* In May, they had 40 employees making $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's $15 * 40 = $600 per day, and $600 * 4 = $2400 per week. So each employee made $2400 in May.
* In total, they paid out $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000 in May.

* In June, a quarter of the employees left, so they had 40 * (3/4) = 30 employees.
* Their total payout for June was $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  He can't have half a card, so Kenny started with 50 cards.

Since each pack has 20 beads, Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

So, most of the cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is a bit shorter at 60 inches.  They're making a pyramid, with four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the shortest one at the very top.

To find the total height, we need to add up the heights of each level. Since 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, their combined height is 9 * 64 = 576 inches.  

Adding the shortest cheerleader's height, the total height of all the cheerleaders is 576 + 60 = 636 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the pyramid is 636 / 12 = 53 feet tall.

They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.  

Since they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.

* **Carpet:** 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
* **Installation:** 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

"Hey there!  

So, Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair costs him $100 / 90 = $1.11 (rounded up to the nearest cent) per pair.

Since the boxes are 10% off, each box costs $100 - ($100 * 0.10) = $90.

"Let's figure out how much more John earned than Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 hours total.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.

That means John worked a total of 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Hey there!  

To figure out how much water Hannah needs, we first need to know how many calories she burns. Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories. Running burns 600 calories per hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"Let's break this down.  If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we can think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point.

Since the total is 4500, let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99x red jelly beans and 1.01x green jelly beans.

Adding those together: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms: 3x = 4500

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 1500

So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30

If a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, it'll last 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

For the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45), the funding increased by 50%, making it $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.50) = $150,000 per month.

The cost for those 45 months is then $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

* Let's say each triplet is 'r' years old.
* One twin is 'r + 7' years old.
* The other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That means 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old.

That means one of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Let's figure out how much money John has left. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, so they cost a total of $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so we need to figure out what the total bill is first.  Let's say the total bill is ""x"". We know that 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, the total bill is $40 (vaccines) + the cost of the heartworm check.

We can set up an equation: x = $40 + 0.60x

Solving for x, we get: 0.40x = $40

Dividing both sides by 0.40, we find that x = $100.

So, the total bill is $100.

John brought $125, so he has $125 - $100 = $25 left.

"Let's figure this out!

They ate a lot of pizza!  

* Bryce and his two friends ate 2/3 of each of their 3 pizzas, that's 2/3 * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices.
* The other two friends ate 3/4 of each of their 2 pizzas, which is 3/4 * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

Then she trades half of her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so that's another 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left, and each of those can be traded for 3 small buttons, giving her 60 more small buttons.

That leaves him with 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies. Those cost $5 each, for a total of 160 * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies, 240 of them, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

*  We know 340 out of 500 third graders passed, so that's 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
* 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
* The fifth graders did twice as well as the fourth graders, so 40% * 2 = 80% passed. That means 400 * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Finally, divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%

"Let's figure this out!

Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic will be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length.

He has 2 bags of chips with 72 chips each, giving him a total of 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.

With 144 chips and 36 chips needed per inch, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"Let's see... they drank a lot of tea!  

* The first group drank 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.
* The second group drank 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.
* Altogether, they drank 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.
* Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts.
* That's 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons of tea!

* March: 40 * 2 = 80 students
* April: 80 * 2 = 160 students
* May: 160 * 2 = 320 students

That means there would be a total of 320 students by the end of May. Since there were 10 to begin with, that's 310 additional students.

"That's easy! If Felix made $105 and each branch costs $0.25 to climb, he climbed 105 / 0.25 = 420 branches. If he worked 5 days, he climbed an average of 420 / 5 = 84 branches per day.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So, Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, so together that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* His awesome friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Let's break this down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Since she fills a 10-ounce jar, we can think of the ingredients like puzzle pieces that fit together.  If we let the zest be represented by ""1 piece,"" then the fragrance is also ""1 piece."" The salt would be ""2 pieces"" (twice the zest), the sugar is also ""2 pieces,"" and the oil is ""4 pieces"" (twice the salt).

That's a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 pieces, which fills the jar perfectly.

So, Tanya uses **4 ounces** of oil.

He does 30 cycles a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks worth $1.20 each. So, he makes $6.00 per cycle (5 tasks * $1.20/task).

That means he earns $180.00 every day (30 cycles * $6.00/cycle).

If we let PJ have 'x' cards, Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 47.

That means Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 153 cards.

* She had 3 yellow eggs because she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs (9 pink / 3 = 3 yellow).

Amazon will give her back 75% of the $32 price, so she'll get $24.00 back.

Finally, subtract the refund and the shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Hey there!  

If Sarah sells her rope for $2 a meter, she'll make 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.  The new rope will cost her 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30. That means she'll have $40 - $30 = $10 left over.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Melanie is going to be 18 in 10 years, that means she's 8 years old now.  To find out when she'll be three times her current age, we need to know when she'll be 24 (8 x 3 = 24).  Since she'll be 18 in 10 years, it will take her another 6 years to reach 24 (24 - 18 = 6).

"Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

* Her chicken costs $4 per pack, and she has 6 packs, so that's $4 * 6 = $24.
* Her apples cost $2 each, and she has 7, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.
* Her strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding it all up, her groceries cost $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If she had $65 to start, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can do some math!

Let's say her usual concert is 'x' minutes long.  

So, 2x (twice the usual length) + 15 (the encore) = 65 minutes.

Subtract 15 from both sides: 2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

Her usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

"Hi there!  Let's see... 4 daisies with 10 petals each means there are 40 daisy petals (4 * 10 = 40). The orchids have 25 petals total (5 orchids * 5 petals each = 25). That means the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids (40 - 25 = 15).

"Hi there!  

Let's figure this out. If Mrs. Smith has 100 plants and a quarter are indoors, that's 25 indoor plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants (100 - 25 = 75).  

If two-thirds of the rest are outdoor plants, that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).  

That means the remaining 25 plants must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25% of her plants are flowering plants (25 / 100 = 0.25, which is 25%).

"Let's break this down!

The whatchamacallit is super speedy at 121 meters per second.  We know it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.

Now, the whirligig is a real speed demon, spinning 5 times faster than the thingamabob. That means the whirligig spins at 11 meters per second times 5, which equals 55 meters per second.

Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, we can say:

Peter's age = John's age + Paul's age

We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, so:

Paul's age = John's age + 10

Let's use these clues to solve for Peter's age!

The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200.

The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

We know they caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  Let's use some algebra to solve this:

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

Now, let's add up all the Pokemon they caught:

A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Combining like terms:

9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9:

A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find out how many Stan caught:

Stan = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each.

* **Sunday:** He sold 15 gingerbread (10 + 5 = 15) and 15 apple pies.
* **Sunday earnings:** 15 gingerbread * $6 = $90, and 15 apple pies * $15 = $225. That's $315 for Sunday.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much Pat needs to spend.

First, we need to figure out how many plants will fit in her flower bed. Since each plant needs 30 inches (12 inches wide plus 18 inches of space), we divide the total length of the bed (1332 inches) by 30 inches per plant: 1332 inches / 30 inches/plant = 44.4 plants.  Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants in total.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17 = 28).

Finally, at $6 per plant, Pat will spend $168 on new plants (28 plants * $6/plant = $168).

"Let's break this down.  The first plane flies to Greece a lot, and the rest of its flights are split between France and Germany.  Since the second plane only flies to Poland, we know the first plane is doing most of the work.  

If the second plane's 44 flights are only half of what the first plane does, then the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights.

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

"Hmm, this sounds like a tricky battery problem! Let's see...

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours, that's a total of 45% lost (9% x 5 = 45%). Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours (7% x 3 = 21%).  

That means it lost a total of 66% of its charge (45% + 21% = 66%).

If it ended up with 28% charge, that means it had 34% left *before* her friends started using it (100% - 66% = 34%).

Since her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge (34% - 28% = 6%), that 6% must have been part of the 34% that was left.

So, to find the original charge, we can figure out what percentage 6% represents of 34%.  

That means the power bank was about 17.65% charged when Maria left for the park (6% / 34% = x / 100%,  so x = 17.65%).

"Let's break this down. If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones cost $4, then large ones cost $12.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x.  

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So, Jim's got $200,000 in loans from college. Plus, he missed out on $100,000 in earnings while he was studying. That means he needs to make back a total of $300,000.

With his new degree, he's making $75,000 a year.  

To earn back the $300,000, it will take him 4 years.

"Hi there! To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to think about the size of the comforter.  

Since it needs to be bigger than the bed on all sides, we add 2 feet to both the length and width. That means the fabric will be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

To find the total area, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

"Let's see... they delivered 425 letters on Monday. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount, so that's 425 / 5 + 17 = 102 letters.  On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, meaning 2 * 102 + 5 = 209 letters.

Adding all three days together: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Let's figure this out!  

If the third person got twice what the second person got, and the second person got $80 more than the first, we can use some algebra to solve this.

Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.

* Second person: x + $80
* Third person: 2 * (x + $80) = 2x + $160

Adding all their shares together, we get: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Dividing both sides by 4: x = $420

So the first person got $420.

"Let's figure this out!  If Rory got half as many balls in the third set as the second, and the total is 19, we know the second set must have been a decent number.  Let's call the number of balls in the second set ""x"".  

That means the third set was x/2.  

Since the first set was 4 more than the second, it was x + 4.

Adding those all together: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Let me see... combining the 'x's, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So the second set was 6 balls.

That means the first set was 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

Now, add that extra cost to the normal price:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Nik has a lot of crayons!  Since each box holds 8 crayons and he has 200 crayons, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25).

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and he has 25 boxes, so the boxes weigh a total of 200 ounces (8 x 25 = 200).

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too (200 crayons x 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces).

That means everything together weighs 400 ounces (200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds).

"Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  She spends 40 minutes on the beach, so she walks at 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 3 miles per hour on the beach.

It takes her 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour to walk on the sidewalk, which is (1/6 hour) * (60 minutes per hour) = 10 minutes.

In total, her walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Over three days, he earns $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from single sunflowers and $56 from bouquets (totaling $82), he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold 30 sunflowers after 3 days.

"Hi there!  

Let's see... Hortex needs to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people. That means they need to provide the equivalent of 2300 people's worth of energy.

Right now, they're only covering 20% of that need per bottle.  To figure out how many more bottles they need, we need to find the difference between the total energy needed and the energy they're currently providing.

Hmm, a bit of math here... 2300 people * 100% energy each = 230,000% total energy needed.

They're currently producing 4200 bottles * 20% energy per bottle = 84,000% energy.

So, they need to make up 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000% more energy.

Since each bottle provides 20%, they'll need 146,000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can figure out how long the red rope is.

Here's how I'd solve it:

* **Think about the relationships:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope
   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

* **Use the total length:**

   * Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37

* **Substitute and solve:** Since we want to find the red rope's length, let's use the relationships to express everything in terms of one of the ropes. I'll use the yellow rope.

   * Red rope = 4 * (Yellow rope - 7)
   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

   * Now substitute these into the total length equation:
      4 * (Yellow rope - 7) + (Yellow rope - 7) + Yellow rope = 37

* **Simplify and solve for the yellow rope:**

   * 4 * Yellow rope - 28 + Yellow rope - 7 + Yellow rope = 37
   * 6 * Yellow rope - 35 = 37
   * 6 * Yellow rope = 72
   * Yellow rope = 12

* **Find the blue rope:**

   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

* **Finally, find the red rope:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope = 4 * 5 = 20

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

* Wendy is five times that age, so Wendy is currently 5(c + 7) years old.

* In 25 years, Colin will be ""c + 25"" years old.

* At that time, he'll be one-third Wendy's current age, meaning c + 25 = (1/3) * 5(c + 7)

Now we can solve for ""c"":

If the whole house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, the second floor (including the roof) is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches tall.

Since the first floor is 180 inches tall, the roof must be 240 inches - 180 inches = 60 inches above the second floor.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism, so we multiply the length, width, and height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, so we need to account for that.  They're about 80% efficient, meaning they only fill up 80% of the space. So, the usable space is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number is 900, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

* Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.
* After the third stop, the number doubled, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Then he swims the other 100 yards at 10 yards per minute, which takes 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

In total, it takes Phineas 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to get home.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much Derrick makes. He sells 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 120 doughnuts (10 x 12 = 120).  Since each doughnut costs $2, he makes $240 every day (120 x $2 = $240).

In June, with 30 days, he'd make $7200 ( $240 x 30 = $7200).

"Hey there!  

So, John wants to speed talk, huh? That's pretty cool!  

Okay, let's see... he starts at 150 words per minute, and after training, he's zooming along at 2.5 times that speed, which is 375 words per minute.

If each page has 450 words, and he's got 10 pages to get through, that's a total of 4500 words.

To figure out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes.
