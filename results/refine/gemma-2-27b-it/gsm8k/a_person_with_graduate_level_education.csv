"Let's analyze Josh's house flipping venture.  

The initial investment is the purchase price plus renovation costs, totaling $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The 150% increase in value represents a gain of $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Adding this gain to the original value, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Therefore, Josh's profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's break down John's transactions.  He earned a total of 13 sets * $15/set = $195 from selling his Lego sets.  We know he had $5 remaining after purchasing video games, meaning he spent $195 - $5 = $190 on games.  Since each game cost $20, he bought $190 / $20/game = 9.5 games.  Since he can't buy half a game, there must be a slight error in the problem statement. Assuming he bought 9 games, he would have spent 9 games * $20/game = $180, leaving him with $195 - $180 = $15, not $5.  

Therefore, based on the given information, there's an inconsistency.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and this is half her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour.

Her walking speed is one-fourth her running speed, making it 6 miles/hour / 4 = 1.5 miles/hour.

Given a total time of 6 hours, she spends 2 hours running (6 hours * (1/3)) and 4 hours walking (6 hours * (2/3)).

Her total distance covered running is 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Her total distance covered walking is 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Therefore, her total distance traveled is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"We can model this scenario as a geometric series. The first term (the top level) is 16 square feet, and the common ratio is 2 (each level is twice the size of the one above it).  

The sum of a finite geometric series is given by:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:

* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

Plugging in our values:

S = 16 (1 - 2^4) / (1 - 2) = 16 (-15) / (-1) = 240

The average square footage is the total square footage divided by the number of levels:

240 square feet / 4 levels = 60 square feet

* Let  'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We're given the following information:

1. *q + b + w = 700* (The total number of bees is 700)
2. *b = 2q* (There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees)
3. *w = 2b* (There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)

Now, we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees ('w').

Since *b = 2q*, we can substitute '2q' for 'b' in the third equation: *w = 2 * (2q) = 4q*.

Substituting '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the first equation gives us: *q + 2q + 4q = 700*.

Combining like terms, we get *7q = 700*.

Solving for 'q', we find *q = 100*.

Finally, substituting the value of 'q' back into the equation *w = 4q*, we get *w = 4 * 100 = 400*.

"Let's work backward through this avian and mammalian heist.

* We know 5 fries remained after the ants absconded with one.
* Before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.
* The raccoon consumed two-thirds of the fries prior to its arrival, meaning 6 fries represent one-third of the total.
* Therefore, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.
* The pigeons devoured 9 fries, leaving 18 fries.
* Adding back the pigeons' share, we find there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before their intervention.
* The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, consuming 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
*  This means there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries initially.

Therefore, there were **34** fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. 

First, we need to determine the total straw used for the hamsters and rabbits:

Subtracting this from the total straw distributed leaves us with the amount used for the rats:

* Straw for rats: 160 total pieces - 70 pieces = 90 pieces of straw

Since each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats:

* Number of rats: 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats

Finally, dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages gives us the number of rats per cage:

* Rats per cage: 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage

"Let's break down this problem.  

The cost of half a dozen plates is 0.5 dozen * $6000/dozen = $3000.

We're told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this, meaning the cups cost $3000 - $1200 = $1800.

Finally, to find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $1800 / (20 dozen * 12 cups/dozen) = $7.50.

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this scenario. 

Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens. We are given the following information:

*  w = r + 2  (two more white chickens than red chickens)
*  3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs collected)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for 'r':

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4



Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Let's analyze this scenario. We can model the water levels in the pools as linear functions, considering the constant leakage.

Let 't' represent the time in minutes.

*  Let S(t) be the amount of water in the small pool at time t.
* Let B(t) be the amount of water in the big pool at time t.

We know:

* S(t) = S(0) - 4t  (where S(0) is the initial amount of water in the small pool)
* B(t) = B(0) - 4t (where B(0) is the initial amount of water in the big pool)

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool: B(t-4) = 2S(t-4)
2. Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool: B(t) = 4S(t)

We can solve this system of equations to find S(t), the amount of water in the small pool now. 

Substituting the linear models into the equations and solving for S(0) will give us the initial amount of water in the small pool. Then, we can calculate S(t) to find the current amount.

"Let's analyze the train's route and service schedule.

The train covers a distance of 75 miles plus 100 miles, totaling 175 miles for the first leg of the journey. The return trip from the third city to the first is 50 miles shorter than the combined distance of the first two legs, meaning it covers 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

Therefore, a complete round trip encompasses 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Given that the train makes three round trips daily, its total daily mileage is 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles.

Finally, with a service interval of 18,000 miles, the train can operate for 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before requiring maintenance.

"Let's analyze the apple-picking scenario.  

We know the sisters gathered a total of 500 apples.  Joanne collected 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount, or 15 apples, from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered twice the amount Joanne did from the tallest trees (60 apples) and three times the amount from the shortest trees (45 apples).

This means they gathered a combined 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.  

Therefore, Joanne must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  c + d = 180 (total number of heads)
*  2c + d = 304 (total number of humps)

We can solve for 'd' using elimination. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

c = 124

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

124 + d = 180

Therefore, d = 56.

"Let's break down Tom's trip:

* **Phase 1:** Over the initial four days, Tom covered a distance of 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

* **Phase 2:**  In the subsequent two days, his travel was reduced to 30% of the first phase's total, amounting to 800 km * 0.30 = 240 km.

* **Phase 3:**  He took a day of rest, resulting in zero kilometers traveled.

* **Phase 4:** During the second week, Tom maintained a consistent pace of 300 km/day for seven days, covering a total of 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Summing up the distances from each phase, Tom's total travel distance for the two-week trip is 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

"Let's break down this problem. Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and has $50 left over for spending money after selling his cards. This means he earned $50 from the sale.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 per card = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell fractions of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his collection, meaning he sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total, then 1/3 of his collection is 33 cards / 2 = 16.5 cards.  Again, we can't have half a card, so we'll round down.

Therefore, he started with 33 cards (sold) + 16 cards (kept) = 49 cards.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. We can represent the unknowns with variables:

*  Let 'B' be the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  Let 'D' be the number of insects David found.
*  Let 'L' be the number of insects Lily found.

We're given the following relationships:

1. L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
3. L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

Now we can use substitution to solve for our variables. From equation (2), we know D = B/2. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:

L = (B/2) + 7

Substituting both equations (1) and (2) into equation (3), we have:

(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplifying this equation:

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find David's total:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"This problem highlights the importance of clearly defining variables and understanding the relationships between them.  

Let's denote:

*  *E* = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
*  *B* = the number of berries Emma collects
*  *T* = the number of seconds remaining on the timer for Emma

We can then express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's:

* Ava jumps on *E + 8* enemies.
* Ava collects *B + 3* berries.
* Ava finishes *T - 4* seconds after Emma.

The scoring system introduces a linear relationship between actions and points:

* Enemy jump: 10 points
* Berry collection: 5 points
* Time remaining: 30 points per second

Therefore, we can express their scores as:

* Emma's score: 10*E + 5*B + 30*T
* Ava's score: 10*(E + 8) + 5*(B + 3) + 30*(T - 4)

To determine the difference in their scores, we would subtract Emma's score from Ava's. However, without specific values for *E*, *B*, and *T*, we can only express the difference as an algebraic expression.

"Let's break down the lifting capabilities:

* **Saskay vs. Pompei:** Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. This means Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

* **Kagiyami vs. Saskay:** Kagiyami surpasses Saskay by a factor of 4, lifting 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

* **Naruto vs. Kagiyami:** Finally, Naruto outlifts Kagiyami tenfold, achieving 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Converting this to feet, we find Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Let's analyze this scenario. We can model this as a classic rate problem. 

* **Kangaroo Rate:** If three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo completes the journey in 54 hours. This implies a rate of 1/54 of the highway per hour.

* **Turtle Rate:** Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, giving them a rate of (1/54) / 2 = 1/108 of the highway per hour.

* **Combined Turtle Rate:** With four turtles, their combined rate is 4 * (1/108) = 1/27 of the highway per hour.

* **Turtle Time:**  Since their combined rate is 1/27, it will take them 27 hours to traverse the entire highway.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as P, Pa, and J respectively. We are given the following system of equations:

1. P + Pa + J = 100
2. Pa = J + 10
3. P = Pa + J

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both equations (2) and the modified equation (3) into equation (1):

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = 2(20) + 10

"Let's break down this landscaping problem.  

First, we need to determine the total number of plants Pat needs.  Her flower bed is 111 feet long, which translates to 1332 inches (111 feet * 12 inches/foot).  Each plant requires 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches for spacing).  Therefore, she can fit 44.4 plants (1332 inches / 30 inches/plant). Since Pat can't buy fractions of plants, she'll need to purchase 45 plants in total.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy an additional 28 plants (45 plants - 17 plants = 28 plants).

Finally, at $6 per plant, the total cost will be $168 (28 plants * $6/plant = $168).

"Let's analyze the temperature changes:

* The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees Celsius per hour on low and 3 degrees Celsius per hour on high.
*  Over 3 hours on low, the temperature decreases by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees Celsius.
*  Switching to high for 4 hours results in an additional cooling of 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees Celsius.
*  The total cooling effect is 6 degrees Celsius + 12 degrees Celsius = 18 degrees Celsius.
*  During the 2 hours the air conditioner is off, the room warms up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees Celsius.
*  Therefore, the final temperature is 18 degrees Celsius cooler - 4 degrees Celsius warmer = 14 degrees Celsius lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as A, Al, H, and W respectively. We are given the following information:

* A = 3
* Al = 4
* H = 2 * (A + Al + H + W) / 4  (Helene's age is twice the average age)
* A + Al + H + W = 20 (Total age of the children)

Substituting the known values into the equation for Helene's age:

H = 2 * (3 + 4 + H + W) / 4

Simplifying the equation:

H = (14 + 2H + 2W) / 4

4H = 14 + 2H + 2W

2H = 14 + 2W

H = 7 + W

Now, substitute the value of H in the total age equation:

3 + 4 + (7 + W) + W = 20

14 + 2W = 20

2W = 6

W = 3

"Let's break down this population growth scenario.  

We begin with a population of 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of these are female, meaning there are 30 female porcupines. Assuming a consistent birth rate, each female produces 4 offspring per month, resulting in 120 new porcupines each month. Over a year (12 months), this translates to 1440 new porcupines (120/month * 12 months).

Adding this to the initial population, we project a total of 1490 porcupines after one year.

"To determine the additional mileage Soledad needs to hike each day, we first calculate her total mileage for June based on her current plan: 125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day * 30 days/month = 7500 miles.  

She aims to hike 9300 miles, so she needs to increase her mileage by 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles.

Distributing this additional mileage evenly across the month, she must hike an extra 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per day.

We're given that she spends 40 minutes on the beach covering 2 miles.  This allows us to calculate her beach speed: 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 3 miles per hour.

Since her sidewalk speed is twice her beach speed, she walks at 6 miles per hour on the sidewalk.  

Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk, covering 1 mile, is 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour, which is equal to 10 minutes.

Adding the time spent on each surface, her total walk time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

* Year 7: Production is seven times the initial amount, yielding 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.

* Year 8:  We know a 10-year-old tree produces 200 more fruits than an 8-year-old tree. Let 'x' represent the yield of a 10-year-old tree.  Therefore, an 8-year-old tree produces x - 200 fruits.

"Let's break down this problem systematically. We're given the following relationships:

*  The red rope's length (r) is four times the blue rope's length (b): r = 4b
*  The blue rope (b) is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope (y): b = y - 7
*  The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters: r + b + y = 37

We can solve for the red rope's length (r) using substitution. 

First, substitute the second equation into the first equation to express 'r' in terms of 'y':

r = 4(y - 7)

Simplify:

r = 4y - 28

Now, substitute both the expression for 'r' and the equation for 'b' into the third equation:

(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

Combine like terms:

6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:

y = 12

Now that we know the yellow rope's length (y = 12), substitute it back into the equation b = y - 7 to find the blue rope's length:

b = 12 - 7

b = 5

Finally, substitute the value of 'b' into the equation r = 4b to find the red rope's length:

r = 4 * 5

r = 20

* Each bedroom contributes 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.
* The total area of the four bedrooms is 240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet.
* The living room, being five times larger than a single bedroom, has an area of 240 square feet/bedroom * 5 = 1200 square feet.
*  Summing the areas of the bedrooms and living room gives us 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.
* Finally, adding the remaining 1000 square feet of the house results in a total area of 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down this problem systematically:

* **Initial Withdrawal:** Thomas begins with $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills.
* **Loss:** He loses 10 bills, reducing his total to 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* **Payment:** Using half his remaining bills, he spends 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* **Bills Remaining:** This leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.
* **Tripling:** Tripling his remaining money, he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills (each worth $20).
* **Total Value:** This equates to 60 bills * $20/bill = $1200.
* **Conversion:** Finally, converting to $5 bills, he has $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 bills.

"Let's analyze the match's scoring:

* Team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.
* In the second half, Team B quadrupled their first-half score, netting 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scored 1/4 of Team B's second-half goals, resulting in 8 / 4 = 2 goals.
*  Team A's total score is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
* Team B's total score is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"Let's denote Wendy's current age as 'w' and Colin's current age as 'c'. We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  w = 5(c + 7)  
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

From the first equation, we can express 'w' in terms of 'c':

* w = 5c + 35

Substitute this expression for 'w' into the second equation:

* c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* 75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
* 40/3 = (2/3)c
* c = (40/3) * (3/2)
* c = 20

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. The problem states that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is represented by 5s - 4.

The total number of cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which equals 116. This can be expressed as the equation: s + (5s - 4) = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120. Finally, dividing both sides by 6 yields s = 20.

Substituting s = 20 back into the expression for blueberry cubes, we find 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.

"Let's analyze the screw requirements for James's table assembly project.  

He requires 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, resulting in a need for 8 screws per table (2 screws/leg * 4 legs/table = 8 screws/table).

With 4 tables, the total screw requirement is 32 screws (8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws).

Given his supply of 40 screws, James will have 8 screws remaining after completing the project (40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws).

"To determine the total amount raised, we need to calculate the earnings of each girl and sum them up.

* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, who raised $430, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Therefore, the total amount raised is $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's analyze the situation.  Aaron's speed is double Vanessa's, meaning he covers the same distance in half the time. Since Vanessa runs twice the distance of Aaron, and Aaron completes his portion in 16 minutes, Vanessa's time would be double that. 

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"Let's break down this age problem:

* Dora's age in three years will be 12, meaning she is currently 9 years old (12 - 3 = 9).
* James is twice Dora's age, making him 18 years old (9 * 2 = 18).
* John was 19 when James was born, so he is currently 37 years old (18 + 19 = 37).
* John's youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5 years old (37 - 32 = 5).
* In three years, the youngest son will be 8 years old (5 + 3 = 8).

"Let's analyze the situation. Ana peels oranges at a rate of 1 orange every 3 minutes, while Jane takes 4 minutes per orange.  Over a 60-minute period, Ana will peel 20 oranges (60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges). Jane, on the other hand, will peel 15 oranges (60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges).

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Let's analyze Mark's expenses:

The radiator, discounted at 80%, costs $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $80.

The mechanic's labor for a 3-hour installation at $50 per hour totals 3 * $50 = $150.

Therefore, Mark's total expenditure is $80 + $150 = $230.

"This problem can be solved using a system of linear equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know:

*  c + w = 20 (total animals)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Solving for 'c' in the first equation, we get w = 20 - c. Substituting this into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5


Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
