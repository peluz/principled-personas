"Okay, so Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That's a total of $130,000 invested.  

The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he bought it for.

Adding that to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the selling price minus his investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's see... Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so before that she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.  

Then she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Finally, she sold a third at the green house, which means she started with 12 * 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's break this down. Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 each week from teaching.

She also makes $30 an hour coaching and works 15 hours a week at that, so she earns $30 * 15 = $450 each week coaching.

That means she makes a total of $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If $19.50 is 25% off the original price, that means it's 75% of the original.  To find the original price, we just need to figure out what number 75% of it is equal to $19.50.

We can set up a little equation: 0.75 * original price = $19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75 gives us the original price:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"
"Let's break this down.  If Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio, and their combined age is 162, we can figure out their individual ages.

Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  There are 18 parts in total (7 + 11 = 18). Each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Darrell has 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen has 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see...

* The second friend said 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, so that's 80 / 2 + 20 = 60.
* The third friend said 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 + 80 = 100.

Adding all the guesses together, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80.

"
"Let's see... Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  To figure out how many gold coins she has, we can think of it like this:

If we take away those extra 30 gold coins, we'd have the same number of gold and silver coins. That would be 110 coins / 2 = 55 coins of each type.

Since there are 30 more gold coins, Gretchen has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.

"
"Let's see... Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more than half of that.  Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20, and 5 more than that is 20 + 5 = 25.  Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Terry needs 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, that's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5.00, he'll need to buy 60 / 4 = 15 packs.

That means he'll spend 15 * $5.00 = $75.00 on yogurt.

"Okay, let's break this down.  If Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, then she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she must walk at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).  That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"
"Oh, making candles is such a lovely craft! Let's see... if Charlie makes 20 candles, that means he used 2 pounds of beeswax.  Since his supplies cost $10 per pound, that's $20 in total.  Selling them for $2 each brings in $40.  

So, his profit is $40 - $20 = $20.00

"Okay, let's break this down. 

Meredith writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than that, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 extra articles. So, she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she doubles her Tuesday output, meaning she writes 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles over the three days.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding the two halves together, her total cost for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Oh, that's easy!  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, you just need to work your way down.  

The level below the top would be 32 square feet, then 64, and finally 128 for the bottom level. Add those all up (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240) and divide by the number of levels (240 / 4 = 60).

So the average square footage of a level is 60.

"
"Oh, this is easy!  If there are 60 doggies and twice as many kitties, that's 60 * 2 = 120 kitties.  That makes a total of 180 doggies and kitties.  Since there are 12 fewer bunnies, there must be 180 - 12 = 168 bunnies.  Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.


348

"Oh, this reminds me of that time I was caught in a fog bank in London! It rolled in so quickly.  

Let's see... if it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover 3 miles, and the city is 42 miles across, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 miles are in 42 miles. That's 42 divided by 3, which is 14.

Then, since each 3-mile section takes 10 minutes, we multiply 14 by 10, giving us 140 minutes.

"
"Oh, this reminds me of the time I helped my grandmother bake for the village fair!  Let's see... if he has 110 cookies now, and dropped 5, that means he had 115 before that. Then, he baked 15 extra, so he must have planned to bake 100. Since he wanted to double last year's amount, he baked 50 cookies last year.

"
"Okay, so they're getting $0.20 back for every gallon, and they bought 10 gallons. That means they save 10 times $0.20, which is $2.00.

"
"Let's see... Jamal's phone holds 1800 photos, and that's 6 times more than Brittany's. So Brittany's phone holds 1800 / 6 = 300 photos.  That means there must be 300 / 50 = 6 ducks in Jamal's picture.

"
"Okay, let's see... lumber prices are up 50%, so that's good news for me!

I have those ten 2x4s that cost me $10 each, so that's $100 total.  Now they're worth $15 each, so I can sell them for $150.

My five 4x4s cost $16 each, for a total of $80.  With the price increase, they're worth $24 each, so I can get $120 for those.

That means I'll make $150 + $120 = $270 in total.

Since I spent $100 + $80 = $180 on the lumber, my profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Oh darling, this is simple!  

Think of it like this: for every 20 parts of sugar and water, 7 parts are sugar. If she used 120 teaspoons and cups total, that means each ""part"" is worth 6.  So, she used 7 parts * 6 per part = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  

Four years ago, Adrien made $40,000, so that means Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.40) = $43,076.92 (approximately).

Adding their salaries together, we get $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92

"Let's count up all the fruits! Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 apples. He brought half as many oranges, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.

In total, they have 5 + 10 = 15 apples and 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.  That means they have 15 + 12 = 27 fruits altogether.

"Let's see... Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday, then 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 6 hours each night. That's 12 hours total for those two days. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so 7 hours each night.  That's 28 hours for the rest of the week.  Adding it all up, she slept 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* A watermelon costs $45 because it's three times the price of a pepper, which is $15.
* Oranges are $40 each, which is $5 less than a watermelon.
* So, 4 watermelons cost $180 (4 x $45).
* 20 peppers cost $300 (20 x $15).
* And 10 oranges cost $400 (10 x $40).

Adding those all up, Dillon will spend $880 at the store.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Steve has to go farther, but he's on a bike, so he'll probably be faster.  Tim's on a skateboard, so he'll be slower.  

Let's see... Steve goes 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet, and he's going 440 feet every minute. That means it'll take him 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim only has to go 2 miles, or 10,560 feet. At 264 feet per minute, it'll take him 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

So Steve will be waiting for Tim for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"Oh my goodness, that's quite a story! Let's see... if there were 5 fries left after those pesky ants, and one ant took the last fry, there must have been 6 fries before the ants got to them.  Then the raccoon took two-thirds, which means there were 6 / (1/3) = 18 fries before the raccoon.  

Adding the 9 fries the pigeons ate, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before those feathered fiends. And since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, Dave must have had 27 * 2 = 54 fries to begin with!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so that's 15 times 100 yards, which is 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, so that's 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's 34 times 80 yards, which is 2720 yards.  So in total, Kelly runs 100 yards + 2720 yards, which is 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 yards and Blake runs 1500 yards, so Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther.

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28.  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3, and six sides total. So, there's a 50% chance of rolling higher than a 3.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need an even number on the first roll (50% chance) AND another even number on the second roll (another 50% chance). That means a 25% chance of getting two evens.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% more likely.

"Mommy picked a whole basket of apples, 20 in all! I helped and picked 10.  That means we picked 30 apples together.

"
"Let's see... 160 pieces of straw were used, and the hamsters and rabbits used 50 + 20 = 70 pieces. That leaves 160 - 70 = 90 pieces for the rats.  Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats.  If they're in 3 cages, there must be 15 / 3 = 5 rats per cage.

"
"That's a classic supply and demand problem!  

Here's how I'd figure it out:

The trader makes a profit of $8 per bag ($30 selling price - $22 cost price). To make a total profit of $400, he must have sold 50 bags ($400 / $8 = 50).


50 

"
"Let's see... they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.  The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.  

Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.  

Splitting that evenly between the three friends means each one paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Ducks are such fascinating creatures.  If a flock of ten ducks needs 3.5 pounds of insects each per week, that means they need a total of 35 pounds for the whole flock.  

To figure out their daily needs, we divide that by 7 days in a week.  That comes out to 5 pounds of insects per day for the whole flock.

"
"Let's see... Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees). But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

That means he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 100 - 20 = 130).  But then 30% of those die, which is 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).

So, Tom has 91 trees left (130 - 39 = 91).

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of flamingos! Let's see... they started with 18 pink ones, took away 6, and then added 18 more. That's 30 pink flamingos!  They only had 6 white ones, so there are 24 more pink flamingos than white ones.

"A pen costs the same as a pencil and an eraser together.  If a pencil is $1.20 and an eraser is $0.30, then a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Eight pens would cost 8 x $1.50 = $12.00

"
"That's a lot of Pokemon cards! Let's see... she started with 20, then got three times that, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 more.  Then she got 20 less than that in the second month, so 60 - 20 = 40.  

In the third month, she doubled the first two months combined, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards doubled, so 100 * 2 = 200.

Adding it all up: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards!

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he earns 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them. Publisher B pays double, which is 500 * ($0.05 * 2) = $50.  In total, Mark makes $25 + $50 = $75 each week.  That's 7500 cents!

"
"Let's see... Baldur gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 in the afternoon, so that's 11 pails total.  Each pail has 5 liters, so he gets 11 * 5 = 55 liters of water every day.

"
"Oh, that's wonderful news for John! Let's see, a $5000 bonus is a great start.  And a 5% raise on $2000 a week means he's making an extra $100 each week.  That's $109,200 for the year plus the bonus, so he made a total of $114,200.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... 6 bags of blue pens times 9 pens in each bag is 54 blue pens. Then 2 bags of red pens times 6 pens per bag is 12 red pens.  So that's 54 plus 12, which is 66 new pens.  Adding those to her starting pens, 22 green plus 10 yellow, gives us a total of 98 pens.


98 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

To get an average of 93, Brinley needs a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points.

She's already earned 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

That means she needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 on her last test.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Micheal rode his bike a lot! Let's see... 

He rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week. He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, so that's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers every week. He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

In total, Micheal rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of candy! Let's see... if each chocolate bar is 40 grams and there are 25 of them, that's 1000 grams just from the chocolate.  And the candied apples, well, they're half the weight of the chocolate bars, so each one is 20 grams. With 80 of those, that's another 1600 grams.  

Adding those together, Joe's bag weighs a whopping 2600 grams!

"Oh darling, calculating costs is simply elementary!  

Let's see... half a dozen plates at $6000 each would be $3000, and twenty dozen cups are $1200 less, making them $1800.  Now, with 20 dozen cups, that's 240 cups in total.  So, each cup would cost $1800 divided by 240, which equals $7.50.

$7.50

"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... if Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, and they lay different amounts of eggs, we can figure this out.  

Since the white chickens lay more eggs, he must have more red chickens to make up the difference.  

He gets 42 eggs a day, so let's try a few numbers. If he had 4 red chickens, that's 12 eggs. Then he'd need 8 white chickens to get to 40 eggs (8 chickens x 5 eggs/chicken = 40 eggs). That's 2 more white chickens than red chickens, and it adds up to 42 eggs!

So the answer is 4.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Harriet is 21 now, Adrian is 63 (three times Harriet's age). Zack is 42 (Harriet's age times two).

In three years, they'll be:

"
"Let's see... Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  

Together, they scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

James starts with 40 water Pokemon. He loses 8, so he has 32 left.  He also has 30 fire and 34 grass Pokemon, for a total of 96.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water Pokemon, we divide the number of water Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100: (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the chance is 33%.

Termites are such a nuisance.  If they ate 30% of the redwood, that means 70% is left.  

So, we need to find 70% of the redwood's original weight. 

200 feet tall with 10-foot sections means there are 20 sections. That's 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds total.

70% of 8000 pounds is (70/100) * 8000 = 5600 pounds.

"Let's see... Andrea has 52 apples, and that's 8 more than Jamal. So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.  Jamal also has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits. Together, they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Oh honey, that house is going to be a bit of a stretch for Mrs. Cruz! Let's see... the brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is $17,500. And then there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of $350,000, so that's another $42,000.  Adding those to the selling price, the total comes to $409,500.  That's $9,500 over her budget.

"Oh darling, selling a house can be so complicated! Let's see... Mr. Tan got $400,000 for his house, but those pesky fees really eat into the profit.  

Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, so that's $12,000. And the brokerage fee is 5%, which comes to $20,000.  Adding those together, his total fees are $32,000.

Don't forget, he also had to pay off the rest of his loan, which was $250,000.  

So, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his total expenses ($32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000) from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

Poor Mr. Tan, he's left with $118,000. 


$118,000
"
"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 8 minutes (40% of 20) to get it to 400 degrees. That means it takes a total of 28 minutes to heat up.  Then, since cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, it takes 23 minutes to cook.  

Adding the heating and cooking time together, we get 51 minutes.

"Oh, knitting! I love a good sweater project. Let's see... if the body needs 900 stitches and the collar is a tenth of that, that's 90 stitches for the collar. The rosette is double the collar, so that's 180 stitches.  

Adding those up (900 + 90 + 180 = 1170), we see the body, collar, and rosette use 1170 stitches.  Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds.  

She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.

She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, which is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Adding those together, she spent a total of $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.

"Oh darling, memorizing lines can be such a chore! Let's see... his song has 54 lines.  The first scene is double that, but he only has a third of those lines, so that's 108 lines / 3 = 36 lines. The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so 54 + 6 = 60 lines. And he has four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.  Adding it all up, he has 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines to learn.

"Let's see... Carly had 80 cards.  Two-fifths had an A, so that's 32 cards. That leaves 48 cards. Half of those had a B, so that's 24 cards. That means 24 cards are left. Five-eighths of those had a C, so that's 15 cards.  That leaves 9 cards with a D.

"Sam is 6 years old now. 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 20 popsicles at 25 cents each is $5.00. And 4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each is $2.00.  So, in total, he spent $7.00.

$7.00 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of spots! Let's see... if a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice the number a mamba has, then a mamba must have 35 spots.  

With 40 cobras, that's 40 * 70 = 2800 spots. And with 60 mambas, that's 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots!

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.


2450 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So, Maddy needs enough pizza for 12 players + 3 coaches + (12 players * 2 guests/player) = 39 people.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, she'll need 39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas.

At $15 per pizza, that's 13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195.

"Wow, that's a lot of stories! Let's see...

* Alani wrote 20 stories and doubled that to 40 in the second week.
* Braylen wrote 40 stories and doubled that to 80.
* Margot wrote 60 stories and doubled that to 120.

Altogether, they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

In the first week, they wrote 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

That means they wrote a total of 240 + 120 = 360 stories!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 less than that, so he has 18 points. Tony has double Mike's points, which is 42 points.

After the extra point for having over 20 points, Mike and Tony each get one more.

So, in total, they have 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83 points.

"Okay, let's break this down.

Darren does a lot of exercises! On day two, he does more pushups and dumbbell presses, but fewer squats.  To find the total, we need to add up all the exercises from both days.

*Day 1: 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises*

*Day 2: 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises*

*Total: 170 exercises + 200 exercises = 370 exercises*

At $2 a mile, that's $30,000 just for the driving. Plus, don't forget the $150 bonus every month, which adds up to another $1,800 a year.  

So, in total, he's spending $31,800 a year on his driving service.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Six years ago, Cera was 40, and Noah was half her age, meaning Noah was 20.  We know Chile's population back then was 3000 times Noah's age, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60000 people.

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, Chile's current population is double that amount: 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"
"Let's break this down.  If there are twice as many offensive players as defensive players, and half as many special teams players as defensive players, we can think of it like this:

* **Defense:**  *d* players
* **Offense:** 2 * *d* players
* **Special Teams:** *d* / 2 players

Adding those all together, we get the total number of players: *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, we combine the *d* terms: 3.5*d* = 105

Finally, we divide both sides by 3.5 to find the number of defensive players: *d* = 30

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... 20 marbles plus 50 is 70. Then his dad gave him 8 more. So that's 78 marbles in total.  Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, he has 78 * 2 = 156 kgs of marbles.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  To find the cost, we need to figure out how much water the pool holds. That's called the volume.  

It's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, so it holds 6 times 4 times 5, which is 120 cubic feet of water.

Since it costs $0.10 for every cubic foot, filling the whole pool will cost 120 times $0.10, or $12.00.

We know 40 out of the 100 employees are junior programmers making $2000 each. That's a total of $80,000 for all the junior programmers.

The senior programmers make $400 more, putting them at $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, their total salary is $144,000.

Adding those together, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers each month.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Job A is straightforward: $15 an hour for 2000 hours is $30,000.  With a 20% tax rate, that leaves Nick with $24,000.

Job B is a bit trickier.  First, we take the $6,000 property tax off the top, leaving $36,000. Then, 10% tax on that is $3,600, leaving him with $32,400.

So, Job B pays $8,400 more.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so her initial investment is $64. The first year, the stock goes up 50%, meaning each share is now worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.  That makes her shares worth $96.

The second year, the stock drops 25%, so each share is now worth $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9.  

Her final total is 8 shares * $9/share = $72.

"Let's see... Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so he ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs. That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's see... 200 students split into three groups, with two groups the same size and the smallest one 10 less...  

If we think of it like this: the two bigger groups have a total of 200 - 10 = 190 students.

Since they're the same size, each of those groups has 190 / 2 = 95 students.

That means the smallest group has 95 - 10 = 85 students.



**Answer:** 85 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... if Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, and he has 60 animals total, that means he must have 40 chickens and 20 cows.

Chickens have two legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 chicken legs. Cows have four legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 cow legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... if the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and all the other animals weigh the same as the frog or close to it, we can figure this out.

The blue beetle and green toad are the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds each. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container itself weighs 20 pounds! So, the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"Let's see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 years younger than twice his son's age.  To find the son's age, we can set up a little equation:

Twice the son's age minus 5 equals Carver's age.  

So, 2 * (son's age) - 5 = 45

Add 5 to both sides: 2 * (son's age) = 50

Divide both sides by 2: son's age = 25

"Let's see... there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  If 4 boys were absent, then 53 - 4 = 49 boys were at school.

"There are 12 boys in the park because there are twice as many boys as girls.  That means there are 18 kids in total!

"To figure out the minimum score Jane needs, we add up her scores from the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33 points.  She needs at least 42 points total, so she needs to score 42 - 33 = 9 points on her third test.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's terrible!  It sounds like there was a lot of trouble at Walmart.  

Let's see... if 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks, and 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, that's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.  Then 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons. Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

"
"Let's see... Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8 points.  That means Erin had 3 * 8 = 24 points before scoring more.  Since she scored 14 points, she must have had 24 - 14 = 10 points to begin with.

"
"Okay, let's figure out the total cost of these senior gifts. 

* The picture frames alone will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
*  Adding the etching bumps that up by 20%, so that's an extra 44 seniors * $20/frame * 0.20 = $176.
*  The pins for the two special seniors will be $5/pin * 2 seniors = $10.
* And finally, the cords for the 11 officers will cost $12/cord * 11 officers = $132.

Adding all that up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"Okay, let's figure this out!

They sold 14 pairs on Friday, then double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 14 pairs. But then 6 pairs were returned, leaving them with 8 pairs sold on Sunday.

Adding all the days together: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

"
"Let's see... Tuesdays and Thursdays are 1 hour and 2 hours, so that's 3 hours already.  Then Saturdays are double Tuesday's hour, so that's another 2 hours.  In total, that's 3 + 2 = 5 hours of dance practice.

"Oh darling, that's a simple calculation! If 40% of the equipment was faulty, that means 60% was in good working order.  

So, they spent 60% of $400,000 on functioning equipment, which is $240,000.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Mary has 30 sheep and half give 1 kg of milk and the other half give 2 kg, she gets 15 kg from the first group and 30 kg from the second group. That means she gets a total of 45 kg of milk each day.

"
"Let's see... half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.  That leaves 20 pupils.  If one-fourth of them like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.  So, 20 - 5 = 15 pupils must like yellow!

"
"Well, let's see... Lucy made $56 on Monday, and since each apple costs $4, she must have sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and on Wednesday, she picked double that amount, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 apples.  In total, Lucy picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

"
"Let's break down this loan situation.  

Karan needs to repay the principal amount plus the interest over five months.  To find her monthly payment, we divide the total amount owed by the number of months.

The total amount owed is the principal ($3650) plus the interest. The interest is calculated as (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100, which in this case is ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825.

Adding the interest to the principal gives us a total of $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, dividing the total amount by the number of months gives us a monthly payment of $5475 / 5 = $1095.

"Cho hiked much farther than Chloe! Let's see, Cho hiked for 8 hours at 14 kilometers per hour, so that's 8 times 14, which equals 112 kilometers. Chloe only hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, so she hiked 5 times 9, which is 45 kilometers.  Cho hiked 112 minus 45 kilometers, or 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"
"Let's see... Axel has 50 silver and 80 gold pesos. Anna has double his silver, so that's 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos. And she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, meaning she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

Adding all their silver pesos together, we get 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos.  And all their gold pesos together is 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Finally, 150 silver pesos + 200 gold pesos = 350 pesos in total!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Millie makes 36 cups of lemonade (3 pitchers x 12 cups/pitcher).  She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total.  Since her supplies cost $18, her profit is $18 ($36 - $18).

If she sells all the lemonade in 9 hours (36 cups / 4 cups/hour), her profit per hour is $2 ($18 / 9 hours).

"Oh, that's a classic land division problem!  If he has 12.8 hectares left, which is 2/5 of his original land, then we just need to figure out what 5/5 (the whole) would be.  

We can set up a proportion: (2/5) * x = 12.8 hectares

To solve for x (the original amount of land), we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 hectares * (5/2) = 32 hectares

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... Hulu and Disney Plus together would normally cost $20, but he gets a discount for bundling, so it's $20 minus 20%, which is $4 off. That makes the bundle $16.  Add Netflix, and that's $16 + $10 = $26 total for streaming.  Since cable was $60, he saves $60 - $26 = $34!

"Oh, baking! I love baking!  

Let's see... he needs four times the ingredients, so that's 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 6 bags. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he'll need 2 bottles. That means he needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so he'll need 5 sandwiches. That means he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful pantry problem! Let's see... Allan has double the corn as cannolis, and he starts with 40 cannolis. That means he has 80 corns to begin with. Then he gets 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 100. But he buys 40 fewer corns than that, so he has 60 corns.  Adding that to his original 80, he has 140 corns.  Finally, with 100 cannolis and 140 corns, he has a grand total of 240!

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

In May, they paid 40 employees $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, so that's $15 * 40 = $600 per employee each week. Over a month, that's $600/week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee.  

For all 40 employees, that's $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000 in May.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, so they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 employees leave. That leaves 40 employees - 10 employees = 30 employees.

Their total pay in June is $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding May and June together, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

So, Bill pays $8 a month for the first six months, which is $8 * 6 = $48.

Then it goes up to $12 a month for eight months, so that's $12 * 8 = $96.

Finally, it increases to $14 a month for another eight months, making it $14 * 8 = $112.

Adding all that up, the total cost for two years is $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

"Let's see... Kenny wants to go to the amusement park and needs $100. He has some spending money, so he made $50 from selling his cards.  If each card is worth $1.50, he sold 33 cards (50 / 1.5 = 33.33, but you can't sell parts of cards!).

Since he kept 1/3 of his cards, those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection.  To find the total, we divide the number he sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  Again, he can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  And it's 3 yards long, which is 9 feet. To find the perimeter, we need to know how wide it is.  

We know area is length times width, so 360 square feet is 9 feet times the width. That means the width is 40 feet (360 / 9 = 40).

Now, the perimeter is like adding up all the sides. It's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, 2 times 9 feet is 18 feet, and 2 times 40 feet is 80 feet.  Add those together, and the perimeter is 98 feet!

"Let's see... Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, so that's 1 * 20 + 2 * 20 = 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red, which is 3 * 20 + 4 * 20 = 140 beads.  

Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Okay, so the car traveled for a total of 3 hours.  Let's see... 60 miles per hour for 2 hours is 120 miles, and then 30 miles per hour for 1 hour is another 30 miles. That's a total of 150 miles.

So, the average speed is 150 miles divided by 3 hours, which is 50 miles per hour.

"
"Let's see... I traded some of my sapphires for rubies.  I have 5 sapphires left, and those are worth $800 each, so that's $4000. My two rubies are worth $1200 each, so that's another $2400. Altogether, my jewels are worth $6400.


$6400
"
"That's easy! If they each eat 4 apples a day, together they eat 8 apples a day.  Over 30 days, that's 8 x 30 = 240 apples.

240 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil (2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet). Since he has 10 beds, that's a total of 320 cubic feet (32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet).

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 160 bags (320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags).

At $12 per bag, the total cost will be $1920 (160 bags x $12/bag = $1920).


$1920 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... 60% more green cards than red means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards. That makes 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.  

Since there are as many yellow cards as red and green combined, there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Adding them all up, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards in total.


78 

"
"That's easy!  If 30 fairies flew away, there are 45 left.

"
"That's easy!  

Let's see... 3 out of 8 of Jennifer's puppies have spots, and 4 out of 12 of Brandon's puppies have spots. That's a total of 7 puppies with spots out of 20 puppies.  

7 divided by 20 is 0.35, and if you multiply that by 100, you get 35%!

"
"Well, let's see.  Two boxes of sugar cubes won't weigh much.  And forty-two bales of hay is a lot!  

He's got a lot of oats too.  

Okay, so if his truck can carry 2250 pounds, and all that feed adds up to 4500 pounds, he'll need to make two trips. 


2 

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... three cans at two cents each is six cents. And five bottles at three cents each is fifteen cents. That's twenty-one cents a week.  So in a month, she makes 84 cents.

"
"Let's figure this out! Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, so Toni has 10 + (0.60 * 10) = 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, meaning Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.

"
"Let's see... Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $50.  

Adding that to the $21 Ali already had, he now has $71.

"
"Oh honey, tipping is so important!  A good rule of thumb is to tip 20%, but since Ashley wants to keep it simple, 1/5 of the $15 pizza is a sweet $3.  That means she should give the delivery guy $18 total.

"
"Finley finished in 6th place. 

"
"Let's see... Miss Maria has a lot of cards!  

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

That's a total of 150 + 200 = 350 cards!

But she keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she must have 300 / 10 = 30 students.

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... Becky paid $8.00 for her apples, and Kelly paid $9.00.

"Oh darling, that's simple!  Each room has 15 pieces of laundry.  So for 80 rooms, that's 15 times 80... which is 1200 pieces. 

1200 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of shoes! Let's see...

He starts with 200, gets 10 more on Monday, then 30 more on Wednesday, and another 60 on Friday. That's 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 shoes!

But then he gets rid of 180 on Saturday.  300 - 180 = 120 shoes left.


120 

"
"Ooh, baking! Let's see... if Mary has enough sprinkles for 48 cupcakes and each pan makes 12, she'll need 4 pans.

"
"Let's see... 30 students with 10 pencils each means they started with 300 pencils.  They used a fifth of those, so that's 60 pencils gone. That leaves 240.  Then they only had a third of those left at the end of the year... so 240 divided by 3 is 80.


80 

"
"Let's see... Matt wants 5 cookies.  He gets 2 extra for cleaning his room, so he must eat enough carrot sticks to get 3 cookies (5 - 2 = 3).  Since each carrot stick is worth half a cookie, he needs to eat 6 carrot sticks (3 x 2 = 6).


6 

"
"That's easy!  

The remoras are 12 inches long altogether, and the shark is 120 inches long. That means the remoras are 10% the length of the shark.

"
"Let's see... if three-fourths of the students have computers, that means one-fourth don't.  If 20 students don't have computers, that one-fourth must represent 20 students.  To find the total, we just need to multiply that number by 4.

80 

"
"Okay, so Jason has 21 days to break in his shoes. Since he walks 4 days a week, that's 21 * 4 = 84 days of walking.  He needs to walk for a total of 240 minutes.  

To find out how long he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of walking days: 240 minutes / 84 days = 2.86 minutes per day.

"
"Oh darling, a getaway sounds lovely! Let's see... those plane tickets will be $10,000.  And the hotel, well, it's a busy weekend so it's 20% more than the usual $1500 a night. That means each night is $1800. For three nights, that's $5400.  Adding it all up, the whole trip will cost $15,400.

"
"Let's see... Jasper has half as many blue paints as Ben's 4, so that's 2.  He has three times as many yellow paints as Ben's 3, so that's 9.  In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.


11 

"
"Let's see... the 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  That means the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains (3/4 * 48 = 36).  

Together, they weigh 84 grains (36 + 48 = 84).


84 

"
"Let's see... they need $200 and have $174 so far.

"
"Let's see... Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so he has 20 songs * 3 = 60 songs.  That means Gabriel can add 100 songs - 20 songs = 80 more songs to his player. Luri can add 100 songs - 60 songs = 40 more songs.  So, Gabriel can add 80 songs - 40 songs = 40 more songs than Luri.

"
"Let's see... a family-size pizza costs three times as much as a small one, which is $8.  So the big pizza is $8 times 3, which is $24.  That means Sally spends $8 + $24, or $32 in total.


$32 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Two packs of razors means she's getting 8 razors total.  Since they're buy one get one free, she's really only paying for one pack, which is $4.00. After using her $2.00 coupon, the razors cost $2.00.  That means each razor costs $2.00 divided by 8, which is 25 cents.


25 

"
"Okay, so they have a pyramid with four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the shortest one on top.  That means the tallest nine girls are on the bottom three levels.  

Let's see... nine girls times 64 inches is 576 inches.  Then add the shortest girl's height, 60 inches, and you get 636 inches.  

Now we have to change that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches divided by 12 is 53 feet.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour and works 8 hours a day, that's 40 minutes of walking each day. Over 5 days, she'd walk a total of 200 minutes.

"
"Oh, this reminds me of the time I helped my yiayia make baklava!  Let's see... Ashley has 50 oranges, and Brianne has 20 more than that, so she has 70. Together they have 120 oranges. Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 40 pies.

"
"Let's figure this out!  If the first place costs $200 plus $5 per person for food, and the second place is $25 per person, we need to find out when those costs are the same.  

Think of it like this: for every guest, the second place is $20 more expensive ($25 - $5 = $20).  So, to make up for the $200 difference in the flat fee, we need 10 guests ($200 / $20 = 10).


10 

"
"Let's see... they found a total of 43 insects.  David found half of what Bodhi found, and Lily found 7 more than David. Hmm, a little tricky!

If we think about it, Bodhi must have found an even number of insects since David found half. Let's try some numbers... if Bodhi found 18, then David found 9, and Lily found 16.  That adds up to 43!

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If each of Mario's 6 pups needs 4 snowshoes, that's 6 times 4, or 24 snowshoes in total.  And since each pair costs $12.00, he'll need to spend 24 times $12.00, which is $288.00.

$288.00 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Janet buys a weekly pass, she'll save $2.00.

"
"Let's count them up! The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so that's 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.  And the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, meaning they have 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  

Adding it all together, the farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  

That means they have a total of 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Let's see... Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times more than Sophia. So Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times more than Sophia, meaning Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato. In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To lose a pound, you need to burn 3500 calories more than you eat. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, so that's 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories total.

He has about 200 days until his birthday.  

So, he needs to have a calorie deficit of 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories each day.

He spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is $48.

That leaves him with $32.

He had 100 to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.  On Wednesday, he finished another 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer chairs than sofas, she has 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 66 chairs.  That means Jenna has 64 sofas (66 chairs - 2).

Together they have 84 sofas (20 + 64) and 88 chairs (22 + 66), for a grand total of 172 sofas and chairs.

"Let's see... Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 hours.  He had two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, adding another 2 * 5 = 10 hours. And don't forget that one week with 6 hours!

Adding it all up: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* The printer cost $400 less than the computer, which was $1100. So the printer cost $1100 - $400 = $700.
* Together, the computer and printer cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.
* That means the two monitors cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.
*  Each monitor cost $600 / 2 = $300. 


$300
"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun!  Let's see... if the boys each found 60 shells, and the girls found that many plus four times that amount, they each found 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 shells.  Since there were 10 girls, that means each girl found 300 / 10 = 30 shells.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first. That means he needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the last 15 days of the month.

To find out his daily savings goal, we divide that amount by the number of days: $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 per day.

"Oh, this is easy! If Jeff gets four times as much as Brad, that means Brad's share is one part and Jeff's share is four parts. That makes a total of five parts.  So, each ""part"" is worth $100 / 5 = $20. Jeff gets four parts, so he gets 4 * $20 = $80.

80 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Jeff walks to work and back each day, that's 3 miles there and 3 miles back, for a total of 6 miles a day.  Since he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend. 

Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Two pens will cost $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

So, the final price Daniel pays is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

She gets a 30% commission on the first $1000, which is $300.  Then, on the extra $1500, she earns another 10%, which is $150.

Adding those together, Antonella made $450 in commission.

"Oh darling, that's easy!  Let's see, he has 48 bottles already, and he needs 140. That means he needs to buy 92 more.

"
"Oh, this is easy!  When the water is warm, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile. So for three miles, it would take him 34 minutes times 3, which is 102 minutes. On a cold day, it takes him 16 minutes per mile, so for three miles, it's 16 times 3, which is 48 minutes.  That means he takes 102 minus 48, or 54 minutes longer on a hot day.

"
"Let's see... John earns $10 a day and wants to save $80.  That means it will take him 2 weeks to save enough money.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like a lot of food!  Let's see... if the fish sub is $40, and the cold-cut combo is three times that, it would be $40 x 3 = $120.  

So, the total cost would be $40 + $120 = $160.

$160 

"
"Let's see... 14 buttons have four holes each, so that's 14 times 4, which is 56 holes.  Then there are 7 buttons with two holes, so that's 7 times 2, which is 14 holes.  In total, there are 56 plus 14, which equals 70 holes.

"Juan needs to cut back on his coffee!  Let's see, he drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, and she only has half the recommended amount.  So, if the recommendation is 'x' cups, Juan drinks 5x cups.  To get down to the recommended 4 cups, he needs to reduce his intake by 5x - 4 cups. 


5x - 4 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 3 cages of hamsters times 10 hamsters each is 30 hamsters. Then 3 cages of guinea pigs times 5 guinea pigs each is 15 guinea pigs.  So, 30 plus 15 equals 45 rodents in total.


45 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mark weighs 150 pounds, and Susan weighs 20 pounds less, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, making him 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights (150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds) and divide by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Oh, this is a fun geometry problem!  

So, the sun starts at 32 degrees above the horizon and moves up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours. That means it moves a total of 50 degrees (5 * 10 = 50).

Adding that to the starting angle, the sun will be 82 degrees above the horizon.


82 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, the younger son is 8. Together they need 20 candles. That means James needs 4 packs of candles.  Since each pack costs $3, he'll spend $12.


$12 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, she reads about 80 pages in a week if she reads for 15 minutes each night.  So in two weeks, she read about 160 pages, plus the extra 100 pages from the second week. That's a total of 260 pages!


260 

"
"Let's see... they started with 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.  That means they ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.  

If they started with 12 and ate 7, there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left.

"
"Let's see... Shiloh is 44 now and will be 51 in seven years.  That means his nephew will be 17 in seven years, so the nephew is currently 10 years old.

"
"That's easy! The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth, then $3.00 more for the next three teeth.  For the last two teeth, she got $0.50 each, for a total of $1.00.  Adding it all up, Sharon got $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.


$9.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Richie scored 80 goals, and that's 20 more than Mark, then Mark scored 60 goals. Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, meaning Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.


175 

"
"Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. 


$21
"
"Let's see... Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week. He buys wooden figures for the first four days, and those cost $5 each. That means he spends $20 on wooden figures (4 days * $5/day).

He has $50 left for the rest of the week to buy plastic figures at $2 each.  He can buy 25 plastic figures ($50 / $2/figure).

He bought 4 wooden figures, so in total, he'll have 29 action figures (25 + 4).

"
"Oh my goodness, kittens can be so mischievous!  Let's see, spaying was $200, and those three vaccines were $20 each, so that's $60.  And those poor vases! Four of them at $12 each is $48.  Adding it all up, that little kitty has cost $308 so far. 


308
"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, if Ford grows 40 roses a week but the shops need 65, he's short 25 roses each week.  That means he's short 100 roses every month.

100 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Katina takes out $100 each month for two years, that's $100 * 12 months * 2 years = $2400.  

So, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, let's break down the numbers.  They spend $3.00 on bread for ten sandwiches, which is $0.30 per sandwich. Then they spend another $3.00 per sandwich on cheese and stuff. That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make. They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.  If they sell ten sandwiches, their total profit is $37.00.


$37.00 

"
"Ooh, making crayon muffins is so much fun! Let's see... she has 192 crayons and each muffin needs 8 crayons. That means she can make 24 crayon muffins. If she sells them for $1.50 each, she'll make $36.00! 


$36.00

"Oh darling, replacing carpet can be so expensive! Let's see... 

The bedroom is 18 by 12 feet, so that's 216 square feet.  The carpet itself is $12 a square foot, plus $2 for padding, so that's $14 per square foot already. Then there's the removal, which is $4 a square foot, and installation at $34 a square foot.  

Adding it all up, 216 square feet times $14 plus $4 plus $34...  

Goodness, that's $11,232!

"
"Let's break this down step by step:

* Half of the starting number is 20 / 2 = 10.
* Adding that to the starting number gives us 20 + 10 = 30.
* Dividing that by 5, we get 30 / 5 = 6.
* Subtracting 12 from the starting number gives us 20 - 12 = 8.
* Finally, multiplying those two results gives us 6 * 8 = 48.

"Oh honey, that's easy! If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's is 30% less, that means Juan's house is worth $53,200.  Add those together and you get a combined value of $129,200. 


129200 

"
"Oh my, that's a lot of dishes! Let's see... Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she brought 24 dishes. That's 36 utensils in total for her. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she brought 44 dishes.  That's 84 utensils for her friend. Altogether, they brought 120 utensils. 


120 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Two boxes of contacts will give Pete 180 pairs (90 pairs per box x 2 boxes).  Since each box costs $90.00 after the discount, two boxes cost $180.00.  That means each pair costs $1.00 ($180.00 / 180 pairs).


$1.00 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  John earned $40 more than Jill. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, so in one hour, she burns another 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Let's see... 1% less red than blue, 1% more green than blue...  That means the green and red jelly beans are balanced around the blue ones.  If there are 4500 total, and we think of the blue as the middle, the difference between green and red has to be split evenly on either side.

So, half the difference from the total and the blue amount is 4500 / 2 - 1500 = 750. That means there are 750 * 2 = 1500 jelly beans difference between the green and red.

**Answer:** 1500 

"
"Okay, let's see... so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM, and then increases by another 5 WPM. That means his final speed is 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add up all three speeds: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM.

Then we divide that total by 3: 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.

"
"Let's see... if one angle is twice the smallest and another is three times the smallest, that means the angles are like 1x, 2x, and 3x.  

Adding those up, we get 1x + 2x + 3x = 6x.  

Since all the angles in a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, that means 6x = 180.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.  He increases that by half of 8, which is 4 pounds. So that's 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If a tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's 145,000 rotations a month (400 miles * 725 rotations/2 miles).

If a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, it will last him 6 years (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month / 12 months/year).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the bottle lasts for 120 washes with 2 pumps, then using 1 pump per wash will make the bottle last for twice as many washes, which is 240 washes.

That means each wash costs $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10.

Since Jackie uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents. 


40 

"
"Okay, let's see... Joe wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35, and they're on sale for 30% off.  That means the shirt will cost $25 - ($25 x 0.30) = $17.50. The shorts will cost $35 - ($35 x 0.30) = $24.50.  

So, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00. Since Joe has $50, he'll have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left.


$8.00

"
"Let's figure this out!  

It costs $194 for every meter of repaving. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and Monica's is 150 meters long. That means Lewis' street is 490 - 150 = 340 meters longer.

So, it costs an extra $194/meter * 340 meters = $65960 to repave Lewis' street.


$65960 

"
"Oh, this is a classic case of exponential growth in research costs!  Let's see...

He starts with $500,000 for the first five months. Then it's ten times longer, so that's 50 months total.  For the remaining 45 months, the funding goes up by 50%, meaning each month costs $150,000.

So, the extra funding adds up to 45 months times $150,000 per month, which is $6,750,000.

Adding that to the initial $500,000, the total research cost comes to $7,250,000.

* He's getting a lot of shirts! 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. At $60 each, that's 30 * $60 = $1800.

Adding it all up: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800

* Wednesday: 20 pomegranates at $30 each is $600, but with the 10% discount, she saves $60, making it $540.

So, the difference is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Let's see... we have one set of twins and one set of triplets.  One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years, and all together they add up to 44 years old.  Hmm, to figure out how old one of the twins is, we need to think about this carefully.

If we let 't' be the age of a twin and 'r' be the age of a triplet, we know:

* t = r + 7  (One twin is 7 years older than a triplet)
* 2t + 3r = 44 (Their total age is 44)

We can use these clues to solve for 't'.

Let's substitute the first equation into the second one:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Simplifying that gives us:

2r + 14 + 3r = 44

Combining like terms:

5r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

5r = 30

Dividing both sides by 5:

r = 6

Now we know a triplet is 6 years old.  Let's plug that back into the first equation to find the age of a twin:

t = 6 + 7

So, a twin is 13 years old.

"Let's see... Rong saves 20 coins a month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that, which is 8 more coins. So Neil saves 28 coins a month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

* Oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each, and there are 7, for a total of $21.00.

* Betty has 30% more points than Adam's 50, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.
* Tom has 30 less points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta collected 3 times Tom's points, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

So, Greta has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left over.

"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 2/5 voted by midday, so that's 2000 people. That leaves 3000 people. Then 2/3 of *those* people voted by 4 pm, which is another 2000.  That means 1000 people hadn't voted yet.

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Parker chews 4 pieces a day, he'll need 120 pieces for 30 days (4 x 30 = 120). Since each pack has 15 pieces, he'll need 8 packs (120 / 15 = 8).

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need enough graham crackers for 24 smores (18 for the kids and 6 for the adults). Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, we'll need 3 sleeves.  That means we need 1 box of graham crackers.

"
"Let's see... Dora is 15, and her dad is eight more than twice her age, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

Adding their ages together, we get 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"Let's see... 3 giant cubes use 12 ounces (3 x 4 = 12), 7 medium cubes use 14 ounces (7 x 2 = 14), and 8 small cubes use 4 ounces (8 x 0.5 = 4).  That's a total of 30 ounces used (12 + 14 + 4 = 30).  

If he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left (32 - 30 = 2).

"
"Let's see... Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

If a gallon of milk costs $5, and a half-gallon costs $2 less, that means a half-gallon is $3.

Ten gallons of milk would cost 10 * $5 = $50.

Sixteen half-gallons would cost 16 * $3 = $48.

In total, Cecelia spent $50 + $48 = $98.

"
"Let's see... 10 students like to bake, 5 like basketball, and 10 like music (that's double the basketball fans!).  That's 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 students.

"Oh my, scaring birds is never nice! Let's see... if 12 birds were there and a third flew away, that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds.  That leaves 8 birds. Then 20 more came, so there are 8 plus 20, which equals 28 birds.

"Let's see... two adults and two children, huh?  Okay, so the first park is $26 per adult and $12 per child, so that's $52 + $24, which is $76 total. The second park is $14 per adult and $10 per child, making it $28 + $20, or $48.  

They'd save $28 by going to the second park!

"Okay, let's see... Lorraine's got a lot of sticker trading going on! 

* She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them, which is 27 stickers. That gets her 27 small buttons, and she can trade those for 9 large buttons (27 divided by 3).

* She also has 40 large stickers and trades half of them, which is 20, for 20 more large buttons.

* That leaves her with 20 large stickers. She can trade those for 60 small buttons (20 times 3).

*  Adding it all up, she has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons!

"Joey played a lot of football this week! Let's see, he played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double the Monday amount on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 games.

"
"Let's see... if there were twice as many votes for the regulation as against it, and there are 33 council members in total, that means the votes must have split into three equal parts.

Since there were twice as many votes for it, there were 11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor.

"Let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs!

*  She needs 22 small shirts because twice as many students need small as extra-small.
*  She needs 18 medium shirts because that's 4 less than the number of small shirts.
*  She needs 9 large shirts because that's half the number of medium shirts.
*  She needs 15 extra-large shirts because that's 6 more than the number of large shirts.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

If the three houses need 250 cases total, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can set up a little equation. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. That means the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so it needs x cases.

Adding those all together: x/2 + x + x = 250

That simplifies to 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

In total, he needs 228 plus 146, which is 374 wheels.  If he has 650 wheels, he'll have 650 minus 374 left over. That's 276 wheels!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

So Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, which is 200 movies.  Since he can get those for a third of the price of a regular movie, that's 200 movies * ($10 / 3) = $666.67.

That leaves 400 movies that aren't in a series. Forty percent of those are older movies, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies, 240 of them, are newer and cost $10 each, so that's 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, Mike will spend $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67 to replace his movies.

"Oh, this is a fun one! Let's see... Bob started with more white fish than orange fish.  He bought some more, and now he has twice as many orange ones. That means those new fish must have been mostly orange!  

If he bought 4 white fish, that would make the number of orange and white fish even.  

So the answer is 4. 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 5 miles each way means he drives 10 miles a day.  That's 50 miles for the whole week.  Since his car gets 10 miles to the gallon, he'll use 5 gallons of gas. At $3 a gallon, that's $15 a week.

"Let's break this down.  The company starts with 200 employees and adds 20 more each month for three months, so that's an additional 60 employees (20 x 3 = 60).  That brings their total to 260 employees (200 + 60 = 260).

Now, with each employee earning $4000 per month, the total salary cost is $1,040,000 (260 x 4000 = 1,040,000).

"Let's see... Pierson scored 278 points, and Nikita scored 11 more than half of that.  So half of Pierson's score is 278 divided by 2, which is 139.  Then we add 11 to that, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find their total score, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together: 278 + 150 = 428.

"
"Let's see... Bubbles has 14 stuffed animals in total.  If she wants goats to be 30% of her collection, she needs 14 times 0.30 which equals 4.2. Since you can't buy parts of a stuffed animal, she should buy 5 goats.

"
"Let's see... 30 hours is a lot of gaming!  

Okay, so she plays for half an hour each day for two weeks, that's 14 days. So that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then she plays for 2 hours a day for a whole week, so that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

In total, she's played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours to get her achievement.

* She starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals each = 15 petals
* Then adds 4 flowers * 6 petals each = 24 petals
* Then 5 flowers * 4 petals each = 20 petals
* And finally 6 flowers * 7 petals each = 42 petals

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals!

But oh no, she drops one of each kind.  That means she loses 5 petals.

So, in the vase, there are 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"
"Let's see... they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 to make their s'mores.  They also dropped 3, so that's 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  If they share those, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

So, Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get half that time, which is 10 minutes per quarter. His really good friend gets to play for 1.5 times as long, so that's 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and there are two of them, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* His really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Oh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice that amount, so Joe has 40 cars.  He sells 20% of his cars, which is 8 cars. Then he gives his mother twice that amount, so that's another 16 cars.  In total, Joe gives away 24 cars. That leaves him with 16 cars.

"Oh, that's easy! If they raised $175,000 and $50,000 came from organizations, then the students raised $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each one raised $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Sandy walked for 8 hours one day and half that time the next, she walked for a total of 8 + (8 / 2) = 12 hours.  That's 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

"Oh, that's easy!  If John does 30 cycles a day and each cycle has 5 tasks that pay $1.20 each, he makes $6.00 per cycle.  That means he makes $180.00 a day.  Over a whole week, he'd make $1260.00.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Julie scored 4 less than Sasha in the first game, so she scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Sasha struggled in the second game, scoring 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Adding up both games, Sasha scored a total of 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, we can use some algebra to solve this. Let's say PJ has 'x' cards. That means Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 cards.

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

So, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun! Let's see... if Cindy had 5 green eggs and twice as many blue, that's 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  Then she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. And lastly, she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs!

"Ugh, returning things is such a drag! Let's see... shipping is $0.35 per pound, and the book is 4 pounds, so that's $1.40. Then there's the mileage, $0.08 per mile for 20 miles, which is $1.60.  So shipping is $3 total.  Amazon will only give her back 75% of the $32, which is $24.  That means she's out $3 for shipping plus $8 she doesn't get back, for a total loss of $5.00.

"Ooh, shopping! Let's see... Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so that's $140. Those jeans are $30 each, so two pairs cost $60.  Adding the $20 bag, she spends $80 total. That means she has $60 left.

"Okay, let's calculate this!

Britany makes 18 TikToks a week, and each one takes 4 minutes, so that's 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.

She also spends 2 hours on songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

And her makeup takes 15 minutes a day for 6 days, so that's 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Adding it all up, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Over a month with 4 weeks, that's 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

That's equal to 1128 / 60 = 18.8 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The basic installation is $129.00.  Angela needs 2 extra mirrors, which is $30.00. She also has one extra chandelier for $15.00. And she needs 10 more pictures hung, so that's $150.00.

Adding it all up: $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00


$324.00 

"
"Let's break this down!

Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, who has $20.00. That means Anthony has $30.00.

Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so he saved an extra $12.00 (because 40% of $30.00 is $12.00).

Adding that to Anthony's savings, Roy has a total of $42.00.

"
"Oh my, lifting mountains! That sounds like a job for someone with a bit more... *strength*.  

Let's see, if Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high, and Saskay can lift 12 times that, then Saskay can lift 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting 4 times what Saskay can, so that's 48 inches. And Naruto? He's the strongest of them all, lifting 10 times what Kagiyami can manage. That means Naruto can lift a whopping 480 inches!

Now, there are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Oh, that's easy!  If Mason bikes 8 miles every hour, and he bikes for 4 hours plus another 6 hours, that's a total of 10 hours of biking.

"Oh, this is a fun one!  Let's see... if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 54 hours to cross the whole highway.  

Now, those turtles are only half as fast, so each turtle would take twice as long, or 108 hours. But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than a single turtle. That means it would take them 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Let's figure this out! Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, who made 20. So Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, meaning she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  

In total, they made 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

"Let's see... if each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, and we need to find the total unused length, we just need to figure out how much of each stick is left and add it up!

*  The first stick has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm.
* The second stick has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm.
* The third stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm.

Adding those up, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, then he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, meaning he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 90 socks (60 + 30) and 90 dishes (60 + 30), for a grand total of 180 socks and dishes.

The long answer questions are trickier. She gets 60% of those right, so that's 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 questions correct.  Since those are worth 5 points each, that's 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Adding it all up, Amy scores 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

"Let's see... 5 packs of bacon for $10 means each pack is $2.  Chicken is twice the price of bacon, so each pack is $4.  Six packs of chicken would be $24. Strawberries are $4 a pack, so 3 packs are $12. Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're $2 a pack. Seven packs of apples would be $14.

Adding it all up: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

"This is a tricky one!  To figure out how much Tasha made from lemonade, we need to know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn.  

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times.  Then we can figure out the rest:

* Kamala's lawn: 3 times Joe's, so 3x times
* Alba's lawn: 5 times Joe's, so 5x times

We know Joe pays $6 per mow, so:

* Joe's lawn earnings: $6x
* Kamala's lawn earnings: $18x (3x * $6)
* Alba's lawn earnings: $30x (5x * $6)

That means her total mowing earnings are $6x + $18x + $30x = $54x.

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we subtract her mowing earnings from her total earnings: $80 - $54x.

Without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn ('x'), we can't get an exact number for her lemonade earnings.

"Let's break this down.  

We know all three ages add up to 100. Paul is older than John by 10 years, and Peter's age is the total of Paul's and John's ages.  

If we think of it like this:

* Peter = Paul + John
* Paul = John + 10

We can put those together to say:

* Peter = (John + 10) + John
* Peter = 2John + 10

Now, we know Peter + Paul + John = 100. Let's substitute what we know about Peter:

* (2John + 10) + Paul + John = 100

We also know Paul = John + 10, so:

* (2John + 10) + (John + 10) + John = 100

Combining like terms:

* 4John + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

* 4John = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

* John = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter:

* Peter = 2John + 10
* Peter = (2 * 20) + 10
* Peter = 40 + 10
* Peter = 50

"Let's see... 4 friends times 2 balloons each is 8 balloons. Plus Maria's 1 balloon, that's 9 balloons to start. Then they each got 3 more, so that's 5 people times 3 balloons, which is 15 more balloons.  9 plus 15 is 24 balloons!

Zoey spits her seeds a total of 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

Sydney spits hers a total of 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Together, they spit a total of 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of people: 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.

"Okay, let's see... 

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  If they run 24/7 for a whole month (30 days), the Widgeteer will make a lot more!

Let's do the math:

* Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets
* WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer will make $259,200 ($43,200 widgets * $6/widget) and the WidgetMaster will make $194,400 ($32,400 widgets * $6/widget).

That's a difference of $64,800!

"Okay, let me see...  They caught a total of 339 Pokemon, right?  And Alex caught 5 more than Stan, while Stan caught 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught. Hmm, let me think...

*Let's call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught ""A"".*

*Stan caught 4 times Adelwolfe's amount minus 13, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.*

*Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught 4A - 13 + 5, or 4A - 8 Pokemon.*

*Together, that's A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 Pokemon.*

*Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339*

*Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360*

*Dividing both sides by 9, we find that Adelwolfe caught A = 40 Pokemon.*

*Now, to find how many Stan caught, we plug A = 40 back into the equation for Stan: 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147*



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Okay, so there are 30 students in total.  20% of them play football, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.  Then 25% of those students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.  

In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed.  Since each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, and they are 12 inches wide, that's a total of 18 inches per plant.  

Let's convert the flower bed length to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Now, divide the total length by the space per plant: 1332 inches / 18 inches/plant = 74 plants.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more plants.

Finally, multiply the number of plants she needs by the price per plant: 57 plants * $6/plant = $342.

"Oh, this is a fun one!  Let's see... if Comet Halley comes around every 75 years, and Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age when he first saw it, we need to figure out how old Bill was the first time.

His dad was 30, and Bill was three times that age, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet comes every 75 years, that means 90 / 75 = 1.2 cycles have passed.

So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet!

"Let's see... the first plane is busy! It flies to Greece most of the time, and then splits the rest of its flights between France and Germany.  The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies half as much as the first plane.  If the Poland plane flies 44 times, the first plane flies 88 times.  Since it goes to Greece 3/4 of the time, that's 66 flights. That leaves 22 flights for France and Germany.  So, the first plane flies to France 11 times a day.

"Those silly wolves!  Let's see... Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the whole time Tobias and Chikote howl together, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

All together, they howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. That's 120 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 2 minutes of howling!

"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see, his parents gave him $6 + ($6 x 2) = $18.  Since the trousers cost $30, Adam paid $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

"
"Let's see... Helene is twice the average age, and the total age of all four children is 20. That means the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.  So Helene must be 10 years old.  If Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, and their combined age with Helene is 17, then Wilfred must be 3 years old.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see... 100 guests times 15 cookies each is 1500 cookies.  Half of those went to the church, so that's 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there must have been 50 people there.

"Each adult gets a slice twice as big as each child's slice, so think of it like this: the adults get 2 parts each, and the kids get 1 part each. That's a total of 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 parts.

Since there are 8 parts total, and each adult gets 2 parts, each adult gets 2/8 or 25% of the watermelon.

"Let's see... they sold 8 boxes in total and 64 chocolate bars.  If we divide the total chocolate bars by the number of boxes, we can find out how many are in each box. 

64 / 8 = 8

There are 8 chocolate bars in each box.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

They charge $25 to rent the studio and then $1.50 per student. With 10 students, that's $15 extra per session. So each session costs $40.

They have classes 3 days a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 per week.

In a month, assuming 4 weeks, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of water the pool holds. That's width times length times depth: 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Now, they said to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons. So, 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 gallons per cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, at $0.10 per gallon, filling the pool will cost 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00.


$826.00 

"
"Let's see... they have 9 red sticks, and 5 more blue ones than that, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  Then they have 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, meaning they have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  

Adding them all up, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500. Half of them are boys, which is 750 boys. That means there are 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.

"
"Let's see... Bethany runs 10 laps, and Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means they still need to pump 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"Okay, let me see... so Maria's power bank was losing charge while it was being used.  

It lost 9% per hour for 5 hours, then 7% per hour for 3 hours. That's a total of 45% + 21% = 66% charge lost.

That means 34% was left after all that. But then her friends used some of that, leaving only 28% in the end. So, her friends used 6% of the charge.

That 6% came from the 34% that was left after the initial losses.  

To figure out what the original charge was, we can think of it like this: if 6% is equal to what was left after the losses (34%), then the original charge must have been bigger.

Let's see... 6 divided by 34 is about 0.176, which means the original charge was about 17.65%.



**Answer:** 17.65%

"Ugh, this is so typical Marcus! Okay, let's see...

There's a 50/50 chance he'll get lucky with a sub. If his regular teacher is there, he's got a 40% chance of getting an extension. And even if she doesn't give everyone an extension, there's still a 20% chance he can weasel his way out of it with the dog-ate-my-homework excuse.

So, to figure out the chance he *actually* has to do it, we gotta do some math.  It's easier to figure out the chances he *doesn't* have to do it and subtract from 100%.

* No sub, extension: 60% * 40% = 24%
* No sub, no extension, dog ate it: 60% * 60% * 20% = 7.2%

That means there's a 24% + 7.2% = 31.2% chance he won't have to do it.

So, there's a 100% - 31.2% = **68.8%** chance he'll have to turn it in.

"Oh, that's easy!  To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to make the fabric bigger than the bed.  

Since he wants it 2 feet longer and wider on each side, the fabric needs to be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

"Let's see... they divided $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first, and the third person got twice what the second person got.  

If the first person got *x* dollars, the second got *x + $80*, and the third got *2(x + $80)*.  That all adds up to $1920.

So, *x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920*

Combining like terms, we get *4x + $240 = $1920*

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us *4x = $1680*

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that *x = $420*.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost!

First, we need to know how many people are coming. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people.  But, 4 people can't make it, so that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Since the theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and Kayla has 41 guests, she'll need to pay extra for 41 - 20 = 21 people.

That means she'll pay an extra $6 x 21 = $126 for those extra guests.

Adding that to the base price, the total cost will be $125 + $126 = $251.

"
"Let's see... Maggie and Riza each started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter, which is $60 / 4 = $15. Riza spent a third, which is $60 / 3 = $20.  That means Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left, and Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left. Together, they have $45 + $40 = $85.

"Let's see... 315 bananas for a whole week!  That's a lot of bananas!

Okay, so the first monkey eats 10 bananas a day, and the second one eats 4 more than that, so that's 14 bananas. Together, they eat 24 bananas each day.

If they have 315 bananas for the whole week, that means they have 45 bananas each day (315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day).

That means the third monkey gets to eat 21 bananas every day (45 bananas - 24 bananas = 21 bananas).

"
"That's easy!  If Teddy did half of the first puzzle, that's 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's another 500. In total, he put together 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.


750 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... a dozen roses is $15, and three more roses are $6, so that's $21 total.  She pays with $25, so her change is $4.  Since there are four quarters in a dollar, she gets 16 quarters back.

"
"Oh, that's easy! Let's see... 6 milkshakes times $5.50 each is $33.  Then 9 burger platters times $11 each is $99. And finally, 20 sodas times $1.50 each is $30.  Add those all together and Terry makes $162.00. 


162.00 

"
"Oh darling, train schedules can be so confusing! Let's see... the fourth train is the one Paul needs.  

The first train takes 20 minutes to arrive and then another 20 minutes at the station. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first one leaves, and stays for only 5 minutes. The third train arrives an hour after the second one leaves and departs immediately. Finally, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.

Adding it all up, Paul will be waiting for 115 minutes.

"
"Let's see... Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and already has 120. That means she needs 80 more. Since she saves 10 each week, it will take her 8 more weeks.

"
"Oh, that's a fun little math problem! Let's see...

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, so that's 120% of $1500, which is $1800.

That means his friend saved $200 compared to the original price.  To find the percentage discount, we divide the savings by the original price and multiply by 100%.

($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"
"Oh, this is easy! If each spring makes a new jellyfish every second, and we have five springs, that's like having five jellyfish popping up every second!  In an hour, that's 5 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 18,000 jellyfish! And in four hours, it would be 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

"
"Okay, let's break down Marcel's bike sales. 

He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.

He sold 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half the price of an MTB), bringing in 45 * $250 = $11,250.

That leaves 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, for a total of 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding all those up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 in sales that month.


$131,250
"
"Well, that's easy! If the farmer makes 5 bales an hour and works for 6 hours, that's 5 times 6, or 30 bales.  The truck takes away 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 times 6, or 18 bales. That means there are 30 minus 18, or 12 bales left in the field.

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of studying! Let's see... 

He has 8 classes a day times 40 minutes each, so that's 320 minutes a day.  Then times 5 days a week, that's 1600 minutes just for his regular classes.  And then he studies another 100 minutes each day on the weekend, so that's another 200 minutes.  

That's a total of 1800 minutes a week!  

That's 30 hours! Wow, he's a dedicated student!

"
"Okay, so the ball starts at 72 feet up. After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that, which is 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet.  That's 32 feet!

"Let's figure this out!

The second child is 74 inches tall (6 feet x 12 inches/foot + 2 inches). The third child is 69 inches tall (74 inches - 5 inches).  And the fourth child is 72 inches tall (69 inches + 3 inches).

"
"That's easy!  If the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors, then there were 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg left after the velociraptors. Since that was half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat.

1080 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Two walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each. That's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet total for those walls.

The other two walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Together they're 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the whole room is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

At $12 a gallon, that'll cost him 12 * $12 = $144.


$144 

"
"Oh my gosh, that's a tricky one! Let's see... Ellen left 2 shaken sodas out of 8 total.  So there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend will get sprayed. That's the same as 25%!

"
"Oh, this is easy!  If one train is going 60 miles an hour and the other is going 30 miles an hour, and they are going in opposite directions, they are getting farther apart really quickly.  

After 3 hours, the faster train will have gone 180 miles (60 x 3) and the slower train will have gone 90 miles (30 x 3).  

That means they are a total of 270 miles apart!


270 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day, so he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, for a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

That means he works 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.


240 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If each bus held 35 people and there were 12 buses, that's 35 times 12, which is 420 people. And if each car held 3 people and there were 20 cars, that's 3 times 20, which is 60 people.  So in total, there were 420 plus 60, which equals 480 people.


480

"
"Let's figure this out! Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, so he ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to see what her balance is after the return: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Then, we need to figure out the price of the frying pan after the discount: $20.00 - ($20.00 * 0.20) = $16.00

And the price of the towels after the discount: $30.00 - ($30.00 * 0.10) = $27.00

Now, let's add up the cost of the new purchases: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add that to her balance after the return: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00


$113.00 

"
"Oh, this is a fun one!  Let's see... if 6 jellyfish changed color, and that's only a third of the big ones, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 large jellyfish.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  She's planning for a 20-year retirement, so she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 saved up.

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 saved annually.

To reach her goal, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

"
"Let's see... Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and needs to cut it into smaller pieces.  First, he makes 4 equal parts, so each of those is 100 centimeters / 4 = 25 centimeters long. Then he cuts each of those into 5 even smaller pieces. That means each final piece is 25 centimeters / 5 = 5 centimeters long.

"
"Let's see... if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school has 240 / 0.40 = 600 students.

"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of hiking!  Let's see... if Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June and hikes 250 miles each day, she'll only cover 7,500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days). That means she needs to hike an extra 1,800 miles (9,300 miles - 7,500 miles) during June.  To do that, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

"Let's see... they need 400 toys total and are short 20. That means they've made 380 toys so far.  If four workers made 380 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have made the rest.  

380 toys / 4 workers = 95 toys per worker.

So the fifth worker made 95 toys in 10 hours.

95 toys / 10 hours = 9.5 toys per hour. 


9.5

"Let's figure this out!

Elijah's first dog weighs 1/4 of Kory's 60-pound dog, so that's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"Let's see... Kris got 7 stickers from Rob, and had 9 more, so Kris had 16 stickers total. That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers, and that was only half of what Luis had! So Luis had 32 stickers.  Since Luis got half of Seth's stickers, Seth must have started with 64 stickers.

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, which is 26 eggs (56 - 30). Since they painted the same amount, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half her brother's salary, then her brother makes $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month.

Together, they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000 a month.

Their mom makes twice that, so she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000 a month.

Adding it all up, they have a total of $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 a month.


45000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. That means she walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour on the beach.  Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, she goes 6 miles per hour there.  It takes her 1/6 of an hour to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk, which is 10 minutes.  

So, her whole walk takes 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 20 cows a day for three weeks is 20 times 7 times 3, which is 420 more cows. And 10 chickens a day for three weeks is 10 times 7 times 3, or 210 more chickens. So that's 420 cows plus the starting 50, which is 470 cows. And 210 chickens plus the starting 20, which is 230 chickens.  Altogether, that's 470 plus 230, which equals 700 animals!

"Let's see... 5 men for every 9 women, that's a total of 14 parts. With 84 passengers, that means each part has 6 people.  So there were 54 women to start (9 parts * 6 people/part). After 20 get off, there are 34 left. 


34 

"
"Oh, this is easy! Let's see... he makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet.  Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means each sunflower in a bouquet is worth $8 / 12 = $0.67.  So, each sunflower, whether sold alone or in a bouquet, is worth $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he made $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82.  That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he must have sold 30 sunflowers.

"
"Oh honey, that's a classic case of not accounting for all the angles!  Let's see... Adam's got $100 to start, and each rock costs $5. That means he can buy 20 rocks. But he only sells 60% of them, which is 12 rocks.  If he sells each rock for $7, he makes $84.  

That means he loses $16.

"
"Let's see... Jim had 27 seashells, and that was 5 more than Carlos. So Carlos found 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.  Carrey had half as many as Carlos, so he found 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.  

Altogether they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. If they share equally, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Okay, let me see...

So, Hortex needs to figure out how many more bottles they need to make to cover everyone's energy needs.  They're already making enough to cover 20% of the daily needs for 2300 people, which is great!

Let's see... 2300 people need 100% energy each, so that's 2300 times 100%, which is 230,000% of daily energy in total.

Right now, they're making enough for 4200 bottles times 20% energy per bottle, which is 84,000% of daily energy.

To find out how much more they need, we subtract what they're already making from the total needed: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Finally, since each bottle covers 20%, we divide the remaining energy needed by 20%: 146,000% / 20% = 7300 bottles.


They need to produce 7300 more bottles.

"Oh my goodness, eight babies! That's a lot of little ones to dress.  Let's see... if 3/4 wear purple and 1/4 wear blue, that means 6 wear purple and 2 wear blue.  Then, 1/3 of the purple wearers have bows, so that's 2 more babies.  So, 4 babies in total have bows.  

Since 2 of those babies wearing bows are wearing purple, there's a 50% chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

"Let's break down Abraham's land sales:

* He starts with 80 square meters.
* He sells half (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.
* Then he sells another quarter (80 / 4 = 20 square meters) for $30.
* That leaves him with 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters.
* He sells the rest at $3 per square meter, earning 20 * $3 = $60.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140

"Let's see... 3 dozen eggs is 36, right?  Lamar found 5, Stacy found double that, so she found 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so that's 8. And Mei found half of what Charlie found, which is 4.  

Altogether they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Okay, let's break this down.  

So, he's got two complexes with 200 apartments each, that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.

The third one is 60% bigger than those two combined, so that's 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.

That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he's collecting from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

And he makes $0.40 for each collection, so he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 a week.

"Oh, avocado trees are fascinating! They take a few years to really get going.  

Let's see... a 5-year-old tree gives us 50 avocados. Then, a 6-year-old tree triples that, so that's 150. A 7-year-old tree does even better with seven times the initial amount, which is 350.

An 8-year-old tree produces a bit less than a 10-year-old, by 200 fruits. A 10-year-old tree is a real producer, giving us 20 times the initial amount, or 1000 avocados! That means an 8-year-old tree gives us 800.

Sadly, the tree takes a break in its ninth year and doesn't produce any fruit.

Adding it all up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350 avocados over 10 years.

"Let's see... half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.  The rest of the mural is red, white, and purple, and they each get the same amount. That means each of those colors used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  With four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

If he triples that amount, he has 60 bills. Since each bill is worth $20, that's $1200 total.  Finally, he trades those for five-dollar bills, so he'd have 240 five-dollar bills.

"Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, which is 2 fewer than Team A's 4 goals. In the second half, Team B scored 4 times their first-half amount, meaning they scored 8 goals. Team A scored half as many goals as Team B in the second half, so they scored 2 goals.  

Adding up all the goals, Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match.

"Let's see... he started with 5 inches and used 45%, leaving him with 55% or 2.75 inches.  He uses 20% a day, so that means he has enough chalk for 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 days.  

Since he can't use it when it's too small, he can use it for 2 more full days.

"Let's break this problem down.  

If Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years, that means in seven years, Colin will be w/5 years old.

And in 25 years, Colin will be c + 25 years old, which is equal to one-third of Wendy's current age, or w/3.

We can set up two equations to solve for Colin's current age (c):

*  w = 5(c + 7) 
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for 'w' in the first equation:

* w = 5c + 35

Now, substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

* c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* 75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
* 40/3 = (2/3)c
* c = (40/3) * (3/2)
* c = 20


Colin is currently 20 years old.

So, cupcakes plus brownies equals 10: c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12

"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... five dozens of eggs is sixty eggs. If she sells them in groups of three for a dollar, she can make twenty groups. That's twenty dollars! Since she spent twelve dollars on the eggs, her profit will be eight dollars. 


$8.00 

"
"Oh, this is easy!  Let's see... half of 100 hats is 50, so that's how many red hats Skyler has. That leaves 50 hats left.  If 3/5 of those are blue, then he has 30 blue hats.  That means he must have 20 white hats!


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the jerky is $3.00 off, it costs $15.00.  Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, each stick costs $0.50.  That's the same as 50 cents!


50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

To pass, Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right. That means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

So, she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Oh darling, this is so simple! Let's see... if she made 116 cubes in total, and the blueberry ones are 5 times the strawberry ones minus 4...  

*If* she made 20 strawberry cubes, that would mean she made 96 blueberry cubes. That adds up to 116! 


96
"
"That's easy! Ara has played 160 games (4 years * 40 games/year).  Since she scores 21 points per game, she's scored a total of 3360 points (160 games * 21 points/game).


3360 

"
"Oh my, that's a tricky situation! Let's see... Brendan started with 10 marbles, dropped half, and found 3. That means he lost 5 and found 3, leaving him with 3 marbles. But then he found a bead, not a marble, so he had to take that out.  That leaves him with 2 marbles.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  If Jason needs 15 customers to buy cars, and he gets one customer for every 25 calls, he'd need to make 375 calls (15 customers * 25 calls/customer). 


375 

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like quite the situation! Let's see... they have 4 flashlights, one for each person. And for the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms times 5 candles, making 20 candles.  Adding all those up, they have 16 plus 20, which equals 36 candles.  

In total, they have 36 candles plus 4 flashlights, for a grand total of 40 light sources!

"
"Oh, that's easy! If Mitchell has two bags with 55 chips each, that's a total of 110 chips.  Since there are five people in his family, each person gets 22 chips. 


22
"
"Oh, a Rubik's Cube! Those are tricky. Let's see...

It takes 5 minutes for the first side, then 10 minutes each for the second and third. The last two sides are quicker, only 2.5 minutes each.  

So, adding it all up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.


30 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If there were 20 helmets, and he saw half as many robots, that's 10 robots.  Then, since there were half as many helmets as footballs, there must have been 40 footballs.  So in total, he saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items.


70 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls and each call takes 15 minutes, he handles 24 calls each day.  Over a 5 day work week, that's a total of 120 calls. 

120 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If the new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting and she has 6 paintings, that's 12 x 6 = 72 minutes.  Her old varnish would have taken 7 x 6 = 42 minutes.  So the new varnish takes 30 minutes longer. 


30 

"
"Let's figure out how much water Crista needs!

*  The plants needing half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.
* The plants needing a full cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups of water.
* That leaves 8 plants that need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water every day.

"
"Oh my, poor Phineas!  Let's see... half the distance is 100 yards, and he hops that at 20 yards a minute, so that'll take him 5 minutes. The other half is swimming, which is 100 yards at 10 yards a minute, so that's 10 minutes.  

15 

"
"Ooh, that's a fun project! Let's see... if Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8, he'll need 7 boxes.  Since each box costs $2.00, it will cost him $14.00 to buy all the popsicle sticks.


$14.00 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If the main phone is $20 and the others are half that price, each extra phone is $10. With four extra phones, that's $40 more. So the whole plan is $20 + $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Derrick sells all 10 dozen doughnuts every day at $2 each, he makes $240 a day. Since June has 30 days, he'd make $7200 that month.

$7200 

"
"Let's see... 210 photos divided by 42 photos per day means it will take her 5 days to upload them all.

"
"Oh darling, dry cleaning can get so expensive! Let's see... 5 blouses at $5 each is $25. Then 2 pairs of pants at $8 each is $16. And the skirt is $6. So that's $47 per week.  Over 5 weeks, that's $235.00. 


$235.00 

"
"Oh, that's a fun hobby!  Let's see... if he's talking 2.5 times faster, that's 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.  With 450 words per page and 10 pages, that's a total of 4500 words.  

At 375 words per minute, it would take him 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.


12 

"
"Oh, that sounds like fun! Let's see... 

* Day 2 had 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* Day 3 had 70 * 2 = 140 people.
* The rest of the week, there were 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Adding it all up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people. 


500 

"
"Oh my, that sounds like quite the popcorn party! Let's see... 

He starts with 20, then pops 60 more, then 80, and finally 40.  That's 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels! And then 10 more pop from the leftover heat.

So, Garrett has a total of 210 pieces of popcorn. 


210 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of lemonade! Let's see... he needs 24 lemons for the regular lemonade, and then double the lemons for the extra tart one, so that's 12 more.  

36 

"
"Woof woof! Let's see... 3 German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms.  Those 2 Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms each, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms.  In total, they eat 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms a day.  Over a whole week, that's 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms!

147 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 10 animals with two legs have 20 legs altogether. And 15 animals with four legs have 60 legs.  That means there are a total of 80 legs on the farm. 


80
"
"Let's see... 32 blocks total, 4 blue and 8 yellow (that's double the blue!).  That means there are 20 red blocks.

"Elvis is 54 miles east of his house. 



"
"Oh darling, depreciation can be such a drag! Let's see...  

After the first year, the boat is worth $6300. Then, after the second year, it's down to $4410.  Finally, after the third year, it's worth $3528. 


$3528
"
"Let's see... 232 candies total... 54 red ones... twice that many orange, so 108 orange... and half as many yellow as red, so 27 yellow.  That's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  

That means there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies! 


43
"
"Oh, that sounds like a fun trip! Let's see... if each night at the hotel cost $80, and she stayed for three nights, that's $80 x 3 = $240 for the hotel.  Each bus ride was 10% of the hotel cost, so each ride was $80 x 0.10 = $8. Since she took the bus 7 times, that's $8 x 7 = $56 for the bus.  

In total, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.


296 

"
"Let's see... Mazie started with 52 marbles. Dallas has 21 now, but he lost 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie. That means Darla got 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.


27 

"
"Let's see... two grown-ups at $12 each is $24.  The little one's ticket is $8. And don't forget the popcorn, $3 x 2 is $6.  Adding it all up, that's $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

"
"Oh, that's easy! To find out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to figure out the total length of the fence.  Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides: 20 feet + 15 feet + 20 feet + 15 feet = 70 feet.

70 

"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and Emma is 16 years older, making Emma 56.  To find their average age, we add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 (96 / 2 = 48).

48 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of seashells! Let's see... they found 732 in total, but 67 were cracked.  That means they have 665 good seashells.

"Oh darling, that's easy!  Each place setting is $15.00, and she needs 12, so that's $180.00 in total. 


$180.00
"
"Oh, that's easy!  If Steve took 10 hours, half that time is 5 hours.  Anna took 2 more hours than that, so it took her 7 hours.

"
"Oh, that's easy!  

Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed a day, and Dexter has five pigs, so that's 40 pounds a day. Over a week, that's 280 pounds. If he started with 300 pounds, he'll have 20 pounds left.

20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 36 more.  Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he'll need 6 packs of hot dogs. If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend 6 times 2, which is $12.


$12 

"
"Ooh, let's see! Frances made $40 from cupcakes and another $40 from cookies, so that's $80 altogether.  But she spent $20 on trays. That means she has $60 left.

"
"Oh my goodness, that sounds like so much fun!  Let's see...

They start with 5 kiddos, then each one brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10. Then on the next street, everyone brings two more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20. But then the first 5 kiddos get tired and go home, so we take away 5 from 20. That leaves us with 15 children still chasing the ice cream truck!


15 

"
"Oh no, that's terrible to hear about the floods!  Let's see, if Mamou started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals, she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 

1218 

"
"Ooh, lucky James! Let's see... a quarter is 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  

Add those all together: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents!


105 

"
"Let's see... there are two brothers, one is 12 and the other is twice that age, so 12 x 2 = 24.  The three sisters are all 16. So that's 12 + 24 + (16 x 3) = 84.


84 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  Let's see... 30 minutes of meditation a day is 210 minutes a week.  And 5 days of yoga at an hour each is another 300 minutes. That's a total of 510 minutes a week. Over four weeks, that's 2040 minutes.

2040 

"
"Let's see... 11 small shirts at 3 square feet each is 33 square feet.  Then 8 medium shirts at 4 square feet each is 32 square feet. And 6 large shirts at 6 square feet each is 36 square feet.  Adding those all together, the quilt will be 101 square feet!

"
"A large sunflower has a lot more seeds! It has 50% more than the small one, which means it has 36 + (36 * 0.50) = 54 seeds.  

Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.


90 

"
"Let's see... Timothy has three times the pens George has, so that's 3 * 18 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, meaning she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"
"Let's see... Anne is twice Albert's height, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" now.  Since she grew 3 inches over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.


67 

"
"Oh, that's easy! If they make 5000 bars a day and sell them for $2 each, that's $10,000 per day.  In a week, that's $70,000. Over two weeks, they'd make $140,000.

$140000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Jake gets a deal on the T-shirts - buy one, get one half off. That means the second T-shirt is only $4.  

The shoes are 40% off, so we need to figure out how much that discount is. 40% of $40 is $16.

Let's add up all the prices:

* T-shirt 1: $8
* T-shirt 2: $4
* Shoes: $40 - $16 = $24

Total: $8 + $4 + $24 = $36

"
"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $5, so he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets are $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"
"Let's see... 32 quarters is $8.00, 95 dimes is $9.50, 120 nickels is $6.00, and 750 pennies is $7.50.  Adding those all together, Justin has $31.00 in his jar.


$31.00 

"
"Let's see... ice cream is $3.50, two movie tickets are $7.50 each, so that's $15.00, and the bracelet is $8.50.  That's a total of $27.00. If she started with $40.00, she has $13.00 left.


$13.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so he works on 15 cars per week (5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars).

He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 each week (15 cars * $4/car = $60).

Over two weeks, he'd make $120 ( $60/week * 2 weeks = $120).


$120 

"
"Oh my goodness, that's a lot of cookies! Let's see...

He starts with 18 cookies, eats 3, then 2 more. That's 5 cookies gone, leaving him with 13. Then he shares 2, so he has 11.  But wait! He bakes more! That's 11 plus 12 more cookies, for a grand total of 23 cookies.


23 

"
"Oh, that's easy!  If he sells half his soldiers for $5 each, that's 6 toys * $5 = $30.  The other half would bring in 6 toys * $7 = $42.  So, he'd make a total of $30 + $42 = $72.


72

"
"Let's see... Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $700.

2180 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that distance because he's twice as fast.  Since Aaron finished in 16 minutes, that means he ran each mile in 4 minutes. Vanessa takes twice as long, so she runs each mile in 8 minutes.  

If she ran 4 miles at 8 minutes per mile, it took her 32 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, and he's now 37.

John's youngest son was born when he was 32, so the son is 5 now. In three years, he'll be 8.

"Well, if I peel an orange every 3 minutes and Jane takes 4 minutes per orange, I'll definitely peel more in an hour!  

Let's see... there are 60 minutes in an hour.  I can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane can only manage 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means I'll have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.
