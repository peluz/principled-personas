"Okay, so Janet starts with 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, which is a total of 7 eggs. That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.  Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market.


$18 

"
"Okay, so the robe needs twice as much blue fiber as white fiber.  That means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.  Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, you add those together and get 3 bolts total.

"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 fixing it up. That's a total of $130,000.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, so it went up in value by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

Adding that to the original value, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

So, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


$70,000
"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints three times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters.  To find out how many meters he runs in a week, you multiply the number of sprints per week by the distance of each sprint.

That's 3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints a week.

Then, 9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters a week.


540 

"
"Okay, so Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day.  If she has 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups total. She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

So she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 more cups in the last meal.


20 

"
"Okay, so Kylar's getting a deal on every other glass.  Since he wants 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 for the first glass and $3 for the second (60% of $5), so that's $8 per pair.  

8 pairs at $8 each means he'll pay 8 * $8 = $64.


$64 

"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times that amount, which is 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so they have 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.


260 

"
"Okay, so Carla's downloading a big file, 200 GB.  She usually gets 2 GB every minute.  But then her computer restarts after she's downloaded 40% of it, which is 80 GB. That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB per minute).

The restart takes 20 minutes, and then she has to start over. So she needs to download the whole 200 GB again. That's another 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).

Downloading that will take 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB per minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph). Then he hits traffic and doesn't move for 2 hours. After that, he drives 30 mph for half an hour, which is 15 miles (0.5 hours * 30 mph).  That leaves him with 1.5 hours to drive at 80 mph, so he covers another 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

In total, he drives 135 miles back (15 miles + 120 miles). Since he drove 180 miles out, he's 45 miles from home. 


45 

"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours. That's $400 right there (40 x $10 = $400).

She worked 5 extra hours, so that's overtime. Overtime is 1.2 times her regular pay, so she makes $12 an hour for those extra hours (10 x 1.2 = $12).

Her overtime pay is $60 (5 x $12 = $60).

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, she made $460 this week ($400 + $60 = $460).


$460 

"
"Okay, so the program had 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it got three times that, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then the third month it went down by 30% of the second month's downloads, so 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads less. That means the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total, we add up all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.


366 

"
"Okay, let's break down the cost:

* Donuts: 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204
* Cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160
* Cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Add those all up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694


694 

"
"Okay, so the tree costs $90 to plant.  Every year he makes $10.50 from selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but it costs $3 to take care of it. So he makes a profit of $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).

To figure out how long it takes to make back the $90, we divide the total cost by the yearly profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


12 

"
"Okay, so Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Let's work backward.

* Before the orange house, she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners.

* Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

*  That means she sold 12 / 3 = 4 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

*  So, she started with 12 + 4 = 18 vacuum cleaners.


**Answer:** 18 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the students like contemporary, which is 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.  That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students. Then 25% of those students like jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.  That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students like hip-hop.

So, 12 students out of 20 like hip-hop, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so the merchant wants to make more money, right?  

Let's see... the jewelry will go up by 2.5% of $5000, so that's $5000 times 0.025 which equals $125 more.

The gadgets will go up by 1.2% of $8000, so that's $8000 times 0.012 which equals $96 more.

The jewelry will make him more money, so the answer is $125. 



"
"Okay, so each train travels 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. To find the total distance, we just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she makes $20 * 35 = $700 a week teaching.

She also makes $30 an hour coaching and works 15 hours a week, so she makes $30 * 15 = $450 a week coaching.

That means she makes a total of $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

If she works 50 weeks a year, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.


57500 

"
"Okay, so she eats 3 eggs a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 eggs a week.  Over four weeks, that's 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she eats 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.


7 

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile hike.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it in.  To figure out her needed speed, we do distance divided by time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

6 

"
"Okay, so we start with 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of that is water, which is 6.67 liters. Then we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, which is 9 liters.  

But wait, I spilled a liter of the orange drink! So now we only have 9 liters of orange drink left.

Adding that to the pineapple drink, we have a total of 24 liters.  The total water is 6.67 liters (from the orange) + 9 liters (from the pineapple) = 15.67 liters.


15.67 

"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and Raymond is 6 years older, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.


14 

"
"Okay, so Billy sold 3 DVDs to his first few customers, then another 4 DVDs to the next couple.  Since the last 3 didn't buy anything, he sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.


7 

"
"Okay, so the candle burns for 4 hours.  If it melts 2 centimeters every hour, it'll be 8 centimeters shorter. 


8 

"
"Okay, so the book is 25% off, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  To find the original price, we can set up a proportion: 

75/100 = $19.50 / x

To solve for x (the original price), we can cross-multiply:

75 * x = 100 * $19.50

Then divide both sides by 75:

x = (100 * $19.50) / 75

x = $26.00 


$26.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The chicken, milk, and apples cost $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.
* That means the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.
* Since each pizza box is $8.50, Marie bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.


2 

"
"Okay, so Mishka bought 3 of each item.  

* Shorts cost $16.50 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
* Pants are $22.50 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
* Shoes are $42 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $42 = $126.00

To find the total, we add up the cost of each type of clothing: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


243.00 

"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, that's 60 servings total.  Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons). If each carton costs $4.00, then she'll spend $16.00 in total (4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00).


16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry biked 20 miles to his first stop. Then he biked another 15 miles less than the total distance to get to his second stop. That means his second stop was at mile 60 - 15 = 45.  He biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.


25 

"
"Okay, so the cheaper pair of heels costs $33. The other pair is twice that price, so they cost $33 * 2 = $66.  Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.


$104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like 7 parts to 11 parts.  That means if we add those parts together, we get 18 parts total.

Since their combined age is 162, we divide that by 18 to find out what one ""part"" is worth: 162 / 18 = 9.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Okay, so Gunter's friends are giving some pretty different guesses! Let's break it down:

* Friend 1 says 80 jelly beans.
* Friend 2 says 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess, so that's (80 / 2) + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* Friend 3 says 25% more than Friend 1's guess, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80 jelly beans.


80
"
"Okay, so John spends 0.5 hours per dog each day. Since he has 10 dogs, that's 0.5 * 10 = 5 hours a day.  

Over a whole week, that's 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours.


35 

"
"Let 's' be the number of silver coins and 'g' be the number of gold coins. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so s + g = 110.  We also know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, meaning g = s + 30.

We can substitute the second equation into the first: s + (s + 30) = 110.

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2s = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find s = 40.

Since g = s + 30, then g = 40 + 30 = 70.


70 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Raymond has 40 jewels.
* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's, so Aaron has (40 / 2) + 5 = 25 jewels.
* Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23
"
"Okay, so Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  Then he scores 25% more in the next 20 minutes. That means he scores an extra point (4 x 0.25 = 1). So in the second half, he scores 5 points (4 + 1 = 5).  

In total, he scores 9 points (4 + 5 = 9).


9 

"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and that means he needs 60 yogurts for a whole month (2 x 30 = 60).  Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5, he'll need to buy 15 packs (60 / 4 = 15). That means he'll spend $75 on yogurt for the month (15 x $5 = $75).


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so John sold his Lego sets for $15 each and made enough to buy 8 video games at $20 each, plus he had $5 leftover.  That means he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the games.

To figure out how many Lego sets he sold, we divide the total money he made by the price per set: $165 / $15/set = 11 sets.

Since he started with 13 sets and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.


2 

"
"Okay, so John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days.  He runs for 3 hours the first day, and then half that, which is 1.5 hours, on the other two days.

That means he runs a total of 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.


10 

"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs.  That means she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She walks four times slower than she runs, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She runs for one-third of the six hours, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. That means she runs 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

She walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.  She walks 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 + 6 = 18 miles.


18
"
"Okay, so Suzy's phone is 1 year old. Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, meaning it's 1 * 2 = 2 years old. Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 2 * 4 = 8 years old. 

8 

"
"Okay, so Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally.  But with the gemstone, she can throw it three times that far, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.


200 

"
"Okay, so Grandma Jones made 5 pies and each pie had 8 slices, meaning there were 5 * 8 = 40 slices total. If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices.


26 

"
"Okay, so you can eat 200 more calories today.  The chips have 250 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in a bag. That means each serving is 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams.

You can only eat 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60 grams per serving = 48 grams of chips. 


48
"
"Okay, so Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).


$20.00
"
"Okay, so Meredith writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than that, which is like 2 extra articles, so she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles.

Then on Wednesday, she doubles Tuesday's amount, so she writes 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.


104 

"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 at work, and had 23 left over.  To figure out how many were in the pack she bought, we gotta add up the ones she used and the ones she has left, then subtract the ones she started with: 220 + 23 = 243.  Then 243 - 80 = 163.

163 

"
"Okay, so John bought 5 blue ties because he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40.  He bought twice as many red ties, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 red ties. Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost $40 + ($40 * 0.50) = $60 each.  He spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties. In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.


$800
"
"Okay, so Tracy had a 4-foot wire, which is 48 inches long. She cut it into 6-inch pieces.  To find out how many pieces she got, you just divide the total length by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.


8 

"
"Okay, so the building has 15 floors and 8 apartments on each floor, that's 15 * 8 = 120 apartments total.  If 3/4 of them are full, then 120 * (1/4) = 30 apartments are empty.


30 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd has 252 eggs a day, and that's 252 times 7 for the whole week, which is 1764 eggs.  There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so he has 1764 divided by 12, which is 147 dozen eggs.  He sells them for $2 a dozen, so he makes 147 times 2, which is $294 a week.


294 

"
"Okay, so Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, which means he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  

Since he's coming back at 6 miles per hour, it will take him 5 hours to get back (30 / 6 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.  That means he still needs to take out 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 more pounds. Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. He also fixed 4 car tires, which is 4 * $40 = $160.  His total for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. That's 12 * $40 = $480.

To find the difference, we do $520 - $480 = $40.


Answer: 40 

"
"Okay, so Patchy had three times the number of kittens as the 7 they adopted, which is 7 * 3 = 21 kittens.  Then Trixie had 12 kittens.  That means they have 21 + 12 = 33 kittens from their cats.  Adding the 7 they adopted, they have a total of 33 + 7 = 40 kittens!


40 

"
"Okay, so Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with 28.  Since she puts 2 lollipops in each bag, she can make 14 bags. 


14 

"
"Okay, so Peter spends $14 each time he goes to the movies ($7 for a ticket + $7 for popcorn).  If he has $42, he can go 3 times. 


3
"
"Okay, so the truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds, and the bridge can only hold 5000 pounds. That means there's 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds left for the boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the truck can carry 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.


83 

"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries were $40.00.  The delivery company added 25% of that, which is $10.00. Then they added a $3.00 delivery fee.  So far, that's $40 + $10 + $3 = $53.00.  He also tipped $4.00, so the final price was $53 + $4 = $57.00.


$57.00
"
"Okay, so the bush has 6 groups of raspberries, and each group has 20 raspberries. That's 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries. Then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out on the bush.  

So, 120 plus 67 is 187 raspberries in total.

187 

"
"Okay, so there are 25 oranges total.  One is bad, 20% are unripe (which is 5 oranges since 25 * 0.20 = 5), and 2 are sour.  That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

So, 25 - 8 = 17 oranges must be good.


17 

"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff for the brooch and then another $800 to have someone make it. That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she had to pay 10% for insurance, which is $1300 * 0.10 = $130.

Adding it all up, she spent $1300 + $130 = $1430 on the brooch.


$1430
"
"Okay, so Marcy gets $50,000 a year after working for 40 years. But she gets an extra 5% each year after 20 years.  Since she quits after 30 years, she gets the extra money for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).

That extra 5% is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 each year.

So her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 a year.


$52,500 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month for the first six months. That's $140 * 6 = $840.

Then her price goes down by 10%, so she saves $140 * 0.10 = $14 each month.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months.

So for the last six months, she pays $126 * 6 = $756.

In total, she pays $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.


1596 

"
"Okay, so Sophia got 100 miles out of 4 gallons of gas. That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG).  If her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).


300 

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. That means he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each day.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours a week.

Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.


36 

"
"Okay, so each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, that's 10 players per school.  Then they have 2 coaches, so that's 12 people per school. With four schools, that's 12 times 4, which equals 48 people.


48 

"
"Okay, so the treasure hunter had 175 diamonds. There were 35 fewer rubies, meaning there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  There were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so there were 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total, we add up all the gems: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems.


595 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, meaning there are 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys.  That's a total of 120 + 60 = 180 students.  If there are 5 students per teacher, then there are 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.


36 

"
"Okay, so Bailey got $5 each week for 8 weeks, which is a total of $5 * 8 = $40.  Since she has $100 now, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lot of dance classes! Let's see... she teaches 5 classes a day during the week, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday, for a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

If each class has 15 students, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students in total.

Since she charges $15 per student, she makes 495 students * $15/student = $7425.00 in a week.


$7425.00 

"
"Okay, so the second recipe has twice the instructions of the first one, which has 20.  That means the second one has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.  To find the total, we add them up: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.


60 

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each cheesecake slice for $4. He sold 43 brownies, so that's 43 * $3 = $129. He also sold 23 cheesecake slices, which is 23 * $4 = $92.  To find out how much he raised in total, we add those together: $129 + $92 = $221.


221 

"
"Okay, so Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

They're charging 2% interest per phone, so that's $150 * 0.02 = $3 interest per phone.

Since she bought 5 phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

That means she has to pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

She's paying over 3 months, so each month she'll pay $765 / 3 = $255.


Answer: 255 

"
"Okay, so Artie's rounding his prices to the nearest dollar.  That means marigolds are $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2.

* He sells 12 marigolds at $3 each, so that's 12 * $3 = $36
* He sells 9 petunias at $2 each, so that's 9 * $2 = $18
* He sells 17 begonias at $2 each, so that's 17 * $2 = $34

If you add all that up, he makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88. 


88
"
"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet, and each level below is double the size.  That means the level below it is 32 square feet, then 64, and then 128 for the bottom level.

To find the average, you add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Then divide that by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.


60 

"
"Okay, so Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of food a day for the first 180 days, that's 180 cups total. Then for the rest of the year, which is 185 days, she needs to feed it 2 cups a day, so that's 370 cups (185 x 2 = 370).

In total, she needs 550 cups of food for the whole year (180 + 370 = 550).  Each bag has 110 cups, so she'll need 5 bags (550 / 110 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Raymond does half of that, which is 200 pounds. David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.


100 

"
"Okay, so Vincent wants to get the best deal on flowers.  

If he buys the packs of 3, it'll cost him $2.50 per pack, and he needs 18 flowers, so that's 18 / 3 = 6 packs. That's $2.50 x 6 = $15.00

If he buys the packs of 2, it's $1.00 per pack, and he needs 18 / 2 = 9 packs. That's $1.00 x 9 = $9.00

He saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying the packs of 2.


$6.00
"
"Okay, so the groomer is giving John 30% off, which is like getting $30 off since 30% of $100 is $30.  That means the grooming will cost him $70.


$70 

"
"Okay, so each girl got 1/6 of the water, which is 24 liters / 6 = 4 liters.  Since there were two girls, they took 4 liters/girl * 2 girls = 8 liters total.

That means 8 liters + 6 liters (for the boy) = 14 liters were used.

If they started with 24 liters and used 14 liters, there are 24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters left.


10 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Charlie starts with 10 stickers, then gets 21 more, so that's 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.  His birthday adds another 23, bringing his total to 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gives away 9, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he uses 28 for a card, so he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.


17 

"
"Okay, so Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds.  That means Alex weighs (4 * 125) - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Okay, so Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. That means he has a total of 3 * 25 = 75 roses.

Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 * 8 = 600 thorns in total. 


600 

"
"Okay, so they won 8 more games than they lost, right?  And they played a total of 22 games.  

To figure this out, you can think of it like this:

* Let 'x' be the number of games they lost.
* They won 'x + 8' games.

If you add the wins and losses, it should equal 22:  x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.


15 

"
"Okay, so Gene's been on vacation four times each year since he was 23.  He's 34 now, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of vacations.

If he gets four shirts per year, he has 11 years * 4 shirts/year = 44 quilt blocks. 


44 

"
"Okay, so the alarm rang 4 times the first time. The second time it rang three times longer, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.  

In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. 

22 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise of 10% of her salary every year after five years.  

* After one year, her salary goes up by $60 ($600 x 0.10 = $60). So she makes $660.
* The next year, her salary goes up by $66 ($660 x 0.10 = $66). Now she makes $726.
* One more year, and her salary goes up by $72.60 ($726 x 0.10 = $72.60). That means she makes $798.60.


798.60 

"
"Let 'x' be the number of copies Harald sold. Marilyn sold 10 times that, so she sold 10x copies. Together they sold 88,000, so x + 10x = 88,000.  Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000. Dividing both sides by 11, we find x = 8,000.

8,000 

"
"Okay, so Christina needs to buy enough gift bags for the people who actually show up. Since not everyone comes, she figures she needs 0.75 bags per person she invites.  

She invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them won't come, so 16 * (3/4) = 12 people will probably be there.

She needs 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

If each bag costs $2, then she'll spend 9 * $2 = $18.


$18 

"
"Okay, so Ted needs to figure out how much potato salad all the dinosaurs will eat.  

The adults each eat 10 pounds, and there are 20 adults, so that's 20 * 10 = 200 pounds.

The kids eat half as much as the adults, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. With 5 kids, that's 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

In total, Ted needs 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad. 


225
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, who has 4. So Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, meaning Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.

To find the total, we add up the number of pets each person has: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.


28 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Corey is one year older than James, who is 10. So Corey is 11.

Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, making her 9.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4.


4 

"
"Okay, so Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and that's 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  That means Gerald used to take 40 seconds.

If Gerald got 10% faster, we need to figure out 10% of 40 seconds.  That's 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds minus 4 seconds, which is 36 seconds.


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs, and for every dog there are 2 cats, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 + 180 = 348 pets.


348 

"
"Okay, here's how to figure that out:

* First, we know 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, so there are (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.
* That means there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls.
*  If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.
*  So, 120 - 80 = 40 girls are not in the Girl Scouts.


Answer: 40 

"
"Okay, so James slept for 2/3 of the time Harry did. That means James slept (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours.  Harry slept 3 more hours than James.


3 

"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce loses half its volume when she cooks it down. That means each can of tomatoes, which starts with 16 ounces, makes 16 / 2 = 8 ounces of sauce.

She made 32 ounces of sauce total, and each can makes 8 ounces, so she used 32 / 8 = 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.


12 

"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars at first, and 5 took an exit. That leaves 25 cars.  We know 20 cars went through in the second 15 minutes, so the rest must have gone through in the first 15 minutes.

25 - 20 = 5 

5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes. 

"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, that's 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she gets 18 more, so she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants.  But she gives one plant from each ledge away, which is 40 plants. That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.


58 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times. That means the second friend rang it 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times, for a total of 20 + 5 = 25 times.
* The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.
* To find the total, we add up the rings from all four friends: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo needs to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

He already read 15 pages, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

Since he has 4 days to finish, he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day. 


6
"
"Okay, so John drinks water with every meal, which is 4 times a day.  He does that for 5 weekdays, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 glasses. On the weekend he skips the water at dinner, so he only drinks 3 glasses a day. That's 3 * 2 = 6 glasses for the weekend.  In total, he drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.


26 

"
"Okay, so the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide, so that's 42 / 3 = 14 sections of 3 miles each.

If each section takes 10 minutes, then it'll take 14 * 10 = 140 minutes for the whole city to be covered in fog.


140 

"
"Okay, so Poppy does a quarter of the puzzle, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.  Then her mom does a third of what's left, so she does 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.  

In total, they've put down 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left.


500 

"
"Okay, so Cody eats three times the amount of cookies Amir eats, and Amir eats 5. That means Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.  

Together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.

20 

"
"Okay, so each box is 5 by 6 by 4 on the outside, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means the inside space is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the volume of one box, you multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since he has three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches. 

72 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Frankie watched 2 hours of TV on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's a total of 5.5 hours.  He watched 7 hours total, so he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Since each of those 30-minute shows is half an hour, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday (1.5 / 0.5 = 3).


3 

"
"Okay, so let's break this down.

Henry has 110 cookies left after dropping some. He dropped 5, so before that he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

He baked 15 extra cookies, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he wanted to bake twice the amount he did last year, he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50
"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.  If they buy 10 gallons, that's 10 * $3.00 = $30.00 before the cashback. Then they get 10 * $0.20 = $2.00 back. So the gas will cost $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.


$28.00
"
"Okay, so Beatrice ate 2 times 24 roll-ups, which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell ate 3 times 14 roll-ups, which is 42.  Together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.  Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking 2 liters of water every 10 feet she rows.  

First, we need to figure out how far she rows in total. She takes 64 seconds to get to shore, and we know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. So, she's rowing 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Over 64 seconds, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet she takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.


16 

"
"Okay, so each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day and it gets cleaned 3 times each of those times.  That means each teacher is responsible for 2 * 3 = 6 cleanings. Since there are 4 teachers, the whiteboard gets cleaned a total of 6 * 4 = 24 times a day.

24 

"
"Okay, so Ryan plants 2 flowers each day for 15 days, that's 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. But 5 of them didn't grow, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.

"
"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds way more pictures than Brittany's.  It says his holds 6 times more, and his holds 1800. That means Brittany's only holds 1800 / 6 = 300 pictures.

Then it says Brittany's phone could hold 50 times more pictures than there are ducks in Jamal's picture. So there must be 300 / 50 = 6 ducks in the picture.

"
"Okay, so Sasha bought some lumber a while back and now it's more expensive.  She wants to sell her leftovers and make some money.

Let's see... she has ten 2x4s that she bought for $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100.  Since prices went up 50%, she can sell them for $15 each now, which is $15 * 10 = $150.

She also has five 4x4s that cost $16 each, so that's 5 * $16 = $80. She can sell those for $24 each now, which is $24 * 5 = $120.

So, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270 selling everything.

But she spent $100 + $80 = $180 to buy the lumber in the first place.

That means she makes a profit of $270 - $180 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio.  That means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is teaspoons of sugar.

First, add the ratio parts: 7 + 13 = 20.

Then, divide the total amount (120) by the total ratio parts (20): 120 / 20 = 6. This means each ""part"" of the ratio is equal to 6.

Finally, multiply the sugar ratio (7) by the value of one ratio part (6): 7 * 6 = 42.


So Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar. 

"
"Okay, so John bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids. That's 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes total.

Since each pair costs $60, he spent 6 * $60 = $360.


$360 

"
"Okay, so they had 10 vehicles on the first day.  That means they brought in 20 more vehicles on the second day (30 total - 10 from day one = 20). Since each container has 5 vehicles, they must have brought in 4 more containers (20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers).


4 

"
"Okay, so Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, which means if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, so that means Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 four years ago.

Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so he made an extra $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000. That means he's making $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000 now.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%, so she made an extra $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69.  That means she's making $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92 now.

Together, they're making $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92 now.



$99,076.92
"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. That means he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets a month.


240 

"
"Okay, so Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.

Kael has 5 apples * 2 = 10 apples and 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges. That's 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. 


27
"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night.  That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night. Since there are 4 more days left in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Adding up all the hours, she slept a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Rosie runs super fast at first! 

She runs 10 miles every hour for 3 hours, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Then she slows down to 5 miles per hour for the rest of the time. She runs for a total of 7 hours, so that's 7 - 3 = 4 more hours.

In those 4 hours, she runs 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the two parts: 30 + 20 = 50 miles.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jennie stamped 60 letters / 3 = 20 letters.  That means there were 30 letters - 20 letters = 10 letters in the stamped pile to begin with.

"
"Okay, so Dylan had 38 chicken sausages. He got 6 more fish sausages, so that's 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  In total, he bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.


82 

"
"Okay, so Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, who made 50. That means Amy made 70 friends.  To find the total, we just add their friends together: 70 + 50 = 120.


120 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and peppers are $15 each, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
* Oranges are $5 cheaper than watermelons, so they cost $45 - $5 = $40.

Now let's figure out the total cost:

* Watermelons: 4 watermelons * $45/watermelon = $180
* Peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300
* Oranges: 10 oranges * $40/orange = $400

Finally, add up the cost of everything: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880


$880
"
"Okay, so the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is there for 24 minutes. That's 12,000 minutes total (500 x 24).  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 200 hours of doctor time (12,000 / 60).

The doctors get paid $150 an hour, so that's $30,000 for the day (200 x 150). The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they make $40,000 (200 x 200).

To find the profit, you subtract the cost from the earnings: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.


$10,000
"
"Okay, so first, a third of the elves quit because of the vomit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.  That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves. Then 10 more quit because of the shin-kicking, so there are 40 - 10 = 30 elves left.


30 

"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. In June, he spent $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.  To find the total, we add his spending for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.


$940 

"
"Okay, so Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. That's 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides total.  They each rode the luge twice, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they went on 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.


60 

"
"Okay, so Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and then 6 times that on Tuesday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.  Since his total for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.


13
"
"Okay, so Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each one costs $15.  That means he spends 4 * $15 = $60 every month on car washes.

Over a whole year, that's $60/month * 12 months = $720.


720 

"
"Okay, so Brian had 20 games but lost 5, leaving him with 15.  Bobby has 3 times that amount minus 5, so that's (3 * 15) - 5 = 40 games.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The subs cost $7.50 each, and she got two, so that's 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
* The chips are $1.50 each, and she got two of those, so that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
* The cookies are $1.00 each, and she got two, so that's 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
*  Adding those up, her food costs $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
* The delivery fee is 20% of the food cost, so that's $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
*  So before the tip, it's $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
* Finally, she adds a $5.00 tip, making the total $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

"
"Okay, so Mark didn't finish a lot of questions.  

For the first test, he could only do 5 questions each hour, and he had 8 hours. That means he finished 5 * 8 = 40 questions.  Since there were 75 questions total, he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unfinished.

The second test was longer, with 100 questions. He only had 6 hours, so he finished 5 * 6 = 30 questions. That means he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions unfinished on that one.

In total, he left 35 + 70 = 105 questions unfinished.

"
"Okay, so there are four times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, plus 22 more.  That means we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs (12) by 4 and then add 22.

12 * 4 = 48
48 + 22 = 70

There are 70 pink gumballs. 

70 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 cars in total.  12 are automatic and 4 are manual, which means 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

That means 4 out of 20 cars are semi-automatic. To find the percentage, we do (4/20) * 100% = 20%.


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's think of it like this:

* If there's 1 queen bee, there are 2 baby bees.
* If there are 2 baby bees, there are 4 worker bees.

That's a group of 7 bees.  

Since we have 700 bees, we can figure out how many groups of 7 that is: 700 / 7 = 100.

So there must be 100 queen bees.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, there are 100 * 2 = 200 baby bees.

And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 200 * 2 = 400 worker bees.



**Answer:** 400 

"
"Okay, so Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. If he worked those 2 hours instead, he'd make $10 an hour times 2 hours, which is $20 a day.  

Over a whole week, that's $20 a day times 7 days, so he'd make $140.


140 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

The milk and eggs are food, so they don't have extra tax. That's $2 + $3 = $5.

The other stuff is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.  

There's a 10% tax on that, so that's $10 * 0.10 = $1 extra.

So the non-food stuff costs $10 + $1 = $11.

In total, everything costs $5 + $11 = $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Kim has 8 clients total.  He needs 2 bottles of bleach per client, and each bottle costs $2, so that's 8 * 2 * $2 = $32 for bleach. He also needs cloths, which cost $5 per pack, so that's 8 * $5 = $40 for cloths.

His total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

He makes $92 each week, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.


$20 

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of pineapples!  

He gets 1000 pineapples each time he harvests (10 hectares times 100 pineapples per hectare). Since he harvests every 3 months, that means he harvests 4 times a year.

So, he gets 1000 pineapples per harvest times 4 harvests, which equals 4000 pineapples in a year.


4000 

"
"Okay, so Johnny has three sets of Legos. One has 500 pieces. Another one is three times bigger, so that's 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The last one is a quarter the size of the 500-piece set, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total, we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.


2125 

"
"Okay, so Debra saw 30 bees leave at first. Then 15 came back (half of 30).  Then 60 more left (double the first group). That means a total of 90 bees flew out during the day. Since all the bees that left came back eventually, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"
"Okay, so Brittany's mom paid for one adult ticket and one child ticket, which costs $12 and $10 respectively. That's a total of $22.  Since she got $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $30.

"
"Okay, so Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy.  That means Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends.

James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"
"Okay, so Steve bikes 3 miles and Tim skateboards 2 miles.  We need to figure out how much longer Tim takes to get home.

First, we gotta convert those miles to feet because the speeds are in feet per minute:

* Steve: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's find out how long each of them takes:

* Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
* Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Looks like Tim takes 4 minutes longer than Steve.


**Answer:** 4

"Okay, so Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire.  

* She did 10 bike tires (5 bikes x 2 tires each).
* She did 9 tricycle tires (3 trikes x 3 tires each).
* And 1 unicycle tire.

That's a total of 20 tires.  

20 tires x $0.25/tire = $5.00


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so Carl buys 10 packs of cookies with 6 cookies in each pack, that's 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.

Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

If he pays with a ten dollar bill, his change is $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

* The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.
* The pigeons ate 3 pigeons * 3 fries/pigeon = 9 fries.
* So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.
* That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.
* Since there were 5 left after the ants, there must have been 4 + 5 = 9 fries to begin with.

"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three days a week for an hour each class, so that's 3 hours a day times 3 days, which is 9 hours. Then he has two classes on the other two days, and each of those is 2 hours long, so that's 4 hours a day times 2 days, which is 8 hours.  That means he has 9 + 8 = 17 hours of class each week.

Over a whole semester, which is 16 weeks, he'd have 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours of class.


272 

"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of baked goods!  

* He makes 300 rolls at 4 inches each, so that's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches of rolls.
* The croissants are 120 * 6 = 720 inches.
* The baguettes are a little trickier. 60 baguettes times 2 feet each is 120 feet, but we need that in inches, so 120 * 12 = 1440 inches.

Now let's add it all up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"
"Okay, so the zookeeper needs to figure out how many bananas to buy for two months.

* The monkeys eat 200 bananas a month.
* The gorillas eat 400 bananas a month.
* The baboons eat 100 bananas a month.

That's a total of 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas each month.

For two months, he'll need 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's like running 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back), so she runs 34 * 80 = 2720 yards doing that.  In total, she runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Okay, let's break down the cost:

* The pens cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.00
* The notebooks cost 2 * $4.00 = $8.00

"
"Okay, so the tank starts with 17 feet of water. Then they add 7 more feet, so on Tuesday it has 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.

On Wednesday, the water level is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.  That means we need to do (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.


16 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 10 starfish - 5 = 5 starfish.
He also caught 6 seahorses - 3 = 3 seahorses.
And 3 clownfish + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.


32 

"
"Okay, so the price goes up 20% every two months. That means every two months, the bag costs $4 more ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Let's see... 36 months is 18 sets of two months (36 / 2 = 18).  So the price goes up $4 a total of 18 times.

That's $72 more ($4 x 18 = $72).

So the bag would cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92).


$92 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Each action figure costs $5, so 3 of them cost 3 * $5 = $15.
* The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it's also $15.
* The red cars cost $4 each, and there are 5, so they cost 5 * $4 = $20.

Adding up the cost of everything: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50

"
"Okay, so if Jackie does her own taxes, she loses out on $35 for every hour she could have worked. Since she'd lose 3 hours, that's 3 * $35 = $105.

The accountant costs $90, so she'd actually save $105 - $90 = $15 by hiring the accountant.

"
"Okay, so Elvira's computer costs €1090, and the extras add up to €157 + €74 + €102 = €333.  That means everything costs €1090 + €333 = €1423 in total.

If she had €1500 to start, she'll have €1500 - €1423 = €77 left for clothes. 


€77
"
"Okay, so Sandra needs 45 eggs in total (15 flans * 3 eggs per flan).  Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, she'll need to babysit 5 times (45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5 sessions).


5 

"
"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 'b' years old, Seth is '2b' years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' and Seth will be '2b + 2'.  We know that those two ages added together will equal 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Okay, so Pancho walks 20 miles a day during the week, which is 5 days. That's 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend he walks less, only 10 miles each day for 2 days, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

In total, he walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week.

"
"Okay, so the jacket costs three times as much as the $25 hat, which is $25 * 3 = $75.  The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.  Adding those all up, each uniform costs $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Okay, so Jake sees a bunch of creepy crawlies! Let's figure out the total legs:

* Those 80 spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
* The 90 insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
* And those 3 weird mutant things have 10 legs each, for a total of 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Adding all those up: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8. So Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, so she's 8 * 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19.

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all four birds: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"
"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. That's a total of $1000 each month.

She wants to pay 50% more, so that's like half of $1000, which is $500 extra.

So, she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500 every month.

In a year, that's $1500 x 12 = $18000.

"Okay, so Billy's got a lot of potatoes to prep! 

Let's see... peeling takes him a minute and a half each, and that's 90 minutes for all 60 potatoes (60 x 1.5 = 90). Cutting is way faster, only 5 seconds per potato, so that's 5 minutes total (60 x 5 / 60 = 5).

Adding those together, it'll take him 95 minutes to get all those potatoes ready.

"Okay, let's break this down.

Zaid makes $6000 a month. He spends $1500 on rent (that's a quarter of his salary) and $2000 on gas (a third of his salary). That's $3500 already gone.

He has $2500 left, and he gives half of that, or $1250, to charity. Now he has $1250 left.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so that's $900 total.

That leaves him with $1250 - $900 = $350.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, who has 40. So Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, meaning Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.
* To find the total, we add up the crabs each person has: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

"
"Okay, so Lloyd makes $10 for every hour he tutors.  In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he made $10 * 5 = $50. In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he made $10 * 8 = $80.  To find out how much he made in total, we add those two amounts together: $50 + $80 = $130.


$130

"Okay, so the winner got 3/4 of the votes, which means the loser got the rest.  If 80 students voted, the winner got 60 votes (3/4 * 80 = 60). That means the loser got 20 votes (80 - 60 = 20).

"
"Okay, so Sandra ordered a lot of flowers!  Let's see... she got 200 pink calla lilies, and those were five times the number of white carnations. So there were 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30 now, which means two years ago she was 28.  

The problem says Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age back then.  Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14.

So Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 two years ago. That means he's 21 now.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 21 + 2 = 23 years old.


23 

"
"Okay, so Team 1 is going to be super consistent, running each lap in 55 seconds. That's a total of 55 x 4 = 220 seconds.

Team 2 is a bit trickier. Their first runner is slower at 60 seconds. Then they get faster by 3 seconds each time. So, the second runner is 57 seconds, the third is 54 seconds, and the last one is 51 seconds.  If you add those up (60 + 57 + 54 + 51) you get 222 seconds.

Team 1 finishes in 220 seconds and Team 2 in 222 seconds, so Team 1 wins by 2 seconds.

"
"Okay, so Jerry has a 50/50 chance of rolling a number bigger than 3, right?  There are three numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6) and six sides total.

To get two even numbers in a row, he has to get an even number on the first roll (that's 3 out of 6 chances) and then another even number on the second roll (again, 3 out of 6). So that's 3/6 times 3/6, which is 1/4 or 25%.

That means it's 50% - 25% = 25% more likely he'll roll a number bigger than 3.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we know the hamsters and rabbits used 50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw.

That means the rats used 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

If they're split evenly into 3 cages, there are 15 / 3 = 5 rats per cage.

"
"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, and there's a 2% interest added each month.  

After one month, she owes $100 + ($100 * 0.02) = $102.

After two months, it's $102 + ($102 * 0.02) = $104.04.

And after three months, it's $104.04 + ($104.04 * 0.02) = $106.12.


$106.12 

"
"Okay, so the trader buys each bag for $20 and then pays another $2 to move it. That means each bag costs him $22 in total. He sells them for $30 each, so he makes $8 profit per bag.  If he made a total of $400 profit, he must have sold 50 bags. 

50 

"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.

Since there are three friends, each person pays $102 / 3 = $34.

"
"Okay, so John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he gets 2 peaches every minute.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he collects for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

That means he collects a total of 180 * 2 = 360 peaches.


360 

"
"Okay, so the ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each per week, and there are 10 ducks. That means they need a total of 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds of insects every week.

To find out how much they need per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7 days: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day.


5 

"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees.  Each year he plants 10 more, but cuts down 2, so he gains 8 trees every year. After 10 years, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 more trees.

So he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. But then 30% of them die, which is 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

That means he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

"
"Okay, so they started with 18 pink flamingos. Then they took away a third, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. That leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink ones.

They painted the 6 they took away white and put them back, so now there are 12 pink and 6 white.

On Sunday, they added 18 more pink ones, so there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

That means there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white ones.

"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil plus an eraser.  The pencil is $1.20 and the eraser is $0.30, so a pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens would cost $1.50 x 8 = $12.00


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and need to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants.  That means they'll use 80 pounds total (40 x 2 = 80).

"
"Okay, so Elaine starts with 20 cards. Then she gets three times that amount, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards.  

The next month she gets 20 fewer than that, so 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she doubles the total from the first two months, which is (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"
"Okay, so Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them. Publisher B pays double, so he makes 500 * ($0.05 * 2) = $50 from them.  That means he makes a total of $25 + $50 = $75 each week.  

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, he makes 75 * 100 = 7500 cents.


7500 

"
"Okay, so Baldur gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 in the afternoon, that's 11 pails total.  Each pail has 5 liters, so he gets 11 * 5 = 55 liters of water each day.

"Okay, so John gets a $5000 bonus, which is awesome!  Then his salary goes up by 5%, so that's $2000 times 0.05 which is $100 extra each week.  His new weekly pay is $2100.  

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he makes $2100 times 52 which is $109,200.

* He had omelets 3 days this week, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 slices.
* And he used 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.

Adding it all up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

Janet starts with 22 green + 10 yellow = 32 pens.

She buys 6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens.

She also gets 2 bags of red pens * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens.

That means she has 54 + 12 = 66 new pens.

In total, she has 32 + 66 = 98 pens.

"
"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average across six tests.  That means she needs a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points.

She's already got 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To get to 558, she needs 558 - 438 = 120 points on her last test.


**Answer:** 120 

"
"Okay, so Micheal rode his bike a lot! 

Let's see... he rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week. He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he changed his routine and rode only twice a week, but for longer distances, 60 kilometers each time. That's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week. He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

In total, he rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.


860 

"
"Okay, so Joe has a lot of candy!  

Let's see... each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and there are 25 of them, so that's 40 * 25 = 1000 grams.

The candied apples are half the weight of the chocolate bars, so each one is 40 / 2 = 20 grams. With 80 candied apples, that's 20 * 80 = 1600 grams.

Adding the weight of the chocolate and the apples, Joe's bag weighs 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.


2600
"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she bought three times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 cakes. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the amount she bought on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 5 = 60 cakes.  

To find the total, we add up the cakes from each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.


76 

"
"Okay, so we know that half a dozen plates cost $3000, and the cups cost $1200 less than that.  So the cups cost $3000 - $1200 = $1800.

Since there are 20 dozen cups, that means there are 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $1800 / 240 = $7.50


$7.50 

"
"Okay, so Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the shoes, which is a total of $70. She already has $30 from babysitting and her savings.  That means she needs to earn another $40.

Since she gets $4 for each lawn she mows, she needs to mow the lawn 10 times.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Let's break this problem down.

We know Jerry has some red chickens that lay 3 eggs each day and some white chickens that lay 5 eggs each day.  He gets a total of 42 eggs every day.  

We also know he has two more white chickens than red chickens.  

To figure out how many red chickens he has, we can use some algebra. Let's say 'r' is the number of red chickens. That means he has 'r + 2' white chickens.

Now we can set up an equation:

3r (eggs from red chickens) + 5(r + 2) (eggs from white chickens) = 42 (total eggs)

Let's solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens. 

"
"Okay, so the park is a rectangle, right?  To find out how far Gary walks, we need to find the distance all the way around. That's called the perimeter.

The perimeter of a rectangle is found by doing 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, it's 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) which equals 15 miles.

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, it will take him 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so she saw 100 people on the first day and 50 more on the second, which is 150 people. That's a total of 250 people for the first two days.  Since she saw 500 people total, she must have seen 250 people on the third day.


250 

"
"Okay, so both pools are losing water at the same rate, which makes things a bit easier.

Let's think about it this way:

*  Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. That means the big pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes) and the small pool also lost 16 gallons.

* Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

This means that even though they both lost the same amount of water, the big pool started with a lot more.  

Since the big pool lost 16 gallons and now has four times the water of the small pool, the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra, which is $200.  That means she owes a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out how much she still owes, we subtract what she paid from the total: $2200 - $1980 = $220.


Answer: 220 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses.  That means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  In total, there are 4 + 11 = 15 flowers.


15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now. Adrian is three times her age, so he's 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

To find the average, we add their ages in three years (24 + 66 + 45 = 135) and divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.


45 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so he got (68 / 2) + 10 = 44 points.
* Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.
* That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.


54
"
"Okay, so Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword and she did 3 of those, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.  Then she does sudoku puzzles in 5 minutes each and did 8 of those, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.  In total, she spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing games.


70 

"
"Okay, so Celine started with 120 liters and used 90 liters, leaving her with 30 liters.  Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.  So, she has 30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters now.


90 

"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias, meaning he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

To find the total, we add the geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent $15000 the first year.  The next year they spent a third of that, which is $15000 divided by 3, or $5000.  To find the total, we add the two years together: $15000 + $5000 = $20000.


$20000 

"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $30 per hour for 3 hours, which is $30 * 3 = $90. Benji spends $18 per hour for 5 hours, so that's $18 * 5 = $90.  

To find the total, we add their costs: $90 + $90 = $180.


180 

"
"Okay, so it takes 6 days by bus.  Since the car is twice as fast, it'll take 6 / 2 = 3 days to drive back.

That means the whole trip will take 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"
"Okay, so James starts with 40 water Pokemon. He loses 8, so he has 32 left.  He's also got 30 fire and 34 grass, for a total of 96 cards.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water Pokemon, we do (number of water Pokemon / total number of Pokemon) * 100%.

That's (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%. Rounding that to the nearest whole number gives us 33%.

"Okay, so Chad's burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds a bunch of stuff: $2 for extra meat, $1 for cheese, $1 for avocado, and $0.50 for the sauces. That's $11 total so far.

Then he gets the meal upgrade for $3, so now it's $14.  But he has a $5 gift card, so he subtracts that.

$14 - $5 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Okay, so Kalinda does 4 pieces a minute and her mom does half that, which is 2. Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

"
"Okay, so first, Ashlyn took 30% of the 120 watermelons, which is 36 melons. That left 120 - 36 = 84 melons.

Then, she took 3/4 of those, which is 3/4 * 84 = 63 melons.

That means there were 84 - 63 = 21 melons left.


**Answer:** 21 

"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so that's 12 times 20,000 which is $240,000.  Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, so that's $24,000 in tax.  Adding those together, the cars cost $264,000.  But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 to register each car, and since he has 12 cars, that's another $12,000.  So in total, Mark pays $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000 for everything.


$276,000
"
"Okay, so Kylie got 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, who had 20. That means Kylie found 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, she doubled her Monday amount, so she collected 25 * 2 = 50 shells.


50
"
"Okay, so Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants. That means there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  

To find the total number of insects, we add the ants and bugs: 50 + 25 = 75 insects.


75 

"
"Okay, so a third of the penguins went swimming, and another third went to eat. That's two-thirds of them gone in total.  

Two-thirds of 36 is 24 (36 / 3 = 12, and 12 x 2 = 24).

That means 12 penguins are still sunbathing. 


12
"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3.  That means they eat a total of 9 tomatoes a day.  

In a week, they'd eat 9 tomatoes a day times 7 days, so that's 63 tomatoes. If each vine gives 3 tomatoes a week, Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per vine = 21 vines.


21 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough slices for 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. That's 20 * 4 = 80 slices total.

Since each pizza has 8 slices, he'll need to order 80 / 8 = 10 pizzas. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Ram can make a new pen for every 5 empty ones.  Since he has 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

That means he'll have his original 25 plus the 5 new ones, for a total of 30 pens.

68 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the students left through exit A, which is 300 students (30/100 * 1000 = 300).

That means 700 students were left (1000 - 300 = 700).

Then, 420 students left through exit B (3/5 * 700 = 420).

So, 280 students must have left through exit C (700 - 420 = 280).


280 

"
"Okay, so John has 54 candies and that's twice the amount Robert has.  That means Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James. 


21
"
"Okay, so Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1. If they each read all the books, that means Dolly reads 3 books total (her 2 plus Pandora's 1) and Pandora reads 3 books total (her 1 plus Dolly's 2).  

So together they read 6 books. 

6 

"
"Okay, so Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of them sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, so that's 6 letters he gets and 6 letters he sends, for a total of 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages he writes and receives every week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then 60 pages takes him 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing each week. 


6
"
"Okay, so Jason uses 15 minutes a day for his boss, and that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes for the whole month.

He also used another 300 minutes, so in total, he's used 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

He started with 1000 minutes, so he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.


250 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Kyle took 5 fries, and Billy took twice that, so he took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
* Together, they took 5 + 10 = 15 fries.
* That means Griffin had 24 - 15 = 9 fries left.
* Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
* Before Colby took any, Griffin had 9 + 2 = 11 fries.
* Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 11 = 16 fries.


**Answer:** 16 

"
"Okay, so there are way more snails in one aquarium than the other.  The problem says the difference in snails (32 - 4 = 28) is twice the number of fish in each tank.  That means there are 28 snails / 2 = 14 fish in each aquarium.


14 

"
"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours each day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, so that's $30000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

That means Jean pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000.


$27000
"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party.  Since she split the cost with her two parents, that means there are 3 people paying.  

So, each person pays $96 / 3 = $32.


$32 

"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions at 50 pounds each, so that's 4 * 50 = 200 pounds of onions.

Since each pound costs $1.50, the total cost is 200 * $1.50 = $300.00 


$300.00
"
"Okay, so Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, for a total of 18 cookies. Sue ate 4 times that on Monday, so she ate 5 cookies * 4 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice what her sister did, so she ate 13 cookies * 2 = 26 cookies. That means Sue ate a total of 20 cookies + 26 cookies = 46 cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 more calories than her sister.


5600
"
"Okay, so there are 60 students total.  Half are boys and half are girls, so that's 30 of each.  The first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls. That means the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the third class must have 20 - 3 = 17 boys.


17 

"
"Okay, so Travis starts with 61 apps. He gets rid of 9, so that leaves him with 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Then he adds 18 more, so he has 52 + 18 = 70 apps.


70 

"
"Okay, so Rick killed a bunch of animals.  Let's see...

Last night he got 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today he got three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he got 3 times the cougars from last night, or 15 * 3 = 45 wolves.

He also got 3 fewer cougars today than last night, so he got 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

In total, he killed 10 + 45 = 55 wolves and 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

That means he killed a total of 55 + 27 = 82 animals.


82 

"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 6, which gives you 18.

18 

"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went 30% less than that, which is 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times.  That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as many as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, so now there are 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

He puts the new cows in all 20 stalls, so each stall gets 240 / 20 = 12 cows.

Finally, to find out how many cows are in 8 stalls, we do 8 * 12 = 96 cows.


96 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* He has $1.00 from the pennies.
* The nickels are worth $2.00 (40 x $0.05 = $2.00).
* The dimes add another $2.00 (20 x $0.10 = $2.00).
* And the dollar bills are worth $40.00.

Adding it all up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00


45.00 

"
"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 sections (200 / 10 = 20).  

So the whole tree originally weighed 8000 pounds (20 sections * 400 pounds/section).

The termites ate 30% of the wood, which is 2400 pounds (8000 * 0.30 = 2400).

That means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds (8000 - 2400 = 5600).


**Answer:** 5600 

"
"Okay, so Nancy has 8 books that are each 50 cents late, so that's 8 times 50 cents, which is $4.00.  Then she has to pay an extra $2.00 because some of the books were over a week late.  So in total, she owes $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half the number of bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Adding those together, they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs to make a total of 66 cookies (36 today + 30 tomorrow).  Since each dozen cookies needs 2 cups of flour, and there are 12 cookies in a dozen, she's making 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

That means she'll need 5.5 * 2 = 11 cups of flour.


11 

"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies, and we want to know how much two-thirds of that is in dollars.

First, we figure out two-thirds of the pennies: (2/3) * 9300 = 6200 pennies.

Then, we remember there are 100 pennies in a dollar, so we divide: 6200 pennies / 100 pennies/dollar = $62.00 


$62.00
"
"Okay, so Maddison starts with 5 boxes of marbles, and each box has 50 marbles. That's 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more from her friend, so she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles in total.


270 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Ferdinand has half the trees Chris has, so he has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, meaning he has (3 * 2) + 5 = 11 trees.

Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 


8
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Samantha has $25 more than Carmen's $100, so she has $100 + $25 = $125.
* Daisy has $50 more than Samantha's $125, bringing her total to $125 + $50 = $175.
* To find the total, we add up what each girl has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.


$400 

"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000, but there are extra fees. The brokerage fee is 5% of the price, so that's $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500.  The transfer fee is 12%, so that's $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

Adding those together, the extra fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

That means the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz can only spend $400,000, so the house is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 over her budget. 


$9,500
"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay 3% for transfer fees, which is $12,000 (3/100 * $400,000 = $12,000). Then there's the brokerage fee, which is 5% of the selling price, so that's $20,000 (5/100 * $400,000 = $20,000).

He also had to pay off the rest of his loan, which was $250,000.  

To find out how much money he actually gets to keep, we add up all the costs: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, we subtract the total costs from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.


$118,000
"
"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees, so that's 20 times 0.40 which is 8 more minutes.  

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, that's 28 + 23 = 51 minutes. 


51
"
"Okay, so he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and got 50 of those, so that's 50 * $5 = $250.  Then the TV ads were $75 each and he got 15, so that's 15 * $75 = $1125.  

To find the total, we add those together: $250 + $1125 = $1375.


$1375
"
"Okay, so half of the 16 balls are golf balls, which is 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, meaning there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300, the second has 12 more than that, which is 312. The third bag is tricky because it has a hole, so it only has half the M&Ms of the first bag, which is 150.  To find the total, we add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762.


762 

"
"Okay, so John has two houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms with 2 windows each. That's 3 * 2 = 6 windows per house from the bedrooms.

Each house also has 4 extra windows, so that's 6 + 4 = 10 windows per house.

Since he has two houses, there are 10 * 2 = 20 windows total.

"Okay, so she spent $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

If she paid with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00


$5.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes double the collar stitches, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

So far, that's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so each sleeve takes (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan spent $800 on tomato seeds (20 packets * $40/packet) and $2400 on celery seeds (80 packets * $30/packet).  

To find the total cost, we add those together: $800 + $2400 = $3200


$3200
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* His song has 54 lines.
* Scene 1 is twice as long as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines.
* But he only has to memorize a third of those lines, which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.
* Scene 2 has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
* He has to memorize four-fifths of those lines, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

In total, he needs to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

"
"Okay, so Carly starts with 80 cards.  

First, we figure out how many have the letter A: (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.

That leaves 80 - 32 = 48 cards.

Then, half of those have B: (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.

That leaves 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Next, (5/8) of those have C: (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, the rest have D: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

"
"Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.  For the big holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.


4 

"
"Okay, so they're 20 years old combined right now. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. That means their combined age will go up by 20 years (10 for each person).

"
"Let's break this problem down.

We know Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now.  Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old. That means Ruby is 6s years old.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old, and Sam will be s + 9 years old.

The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6


Sam is 6 years old now. 

"
"Okay, so Peter spent $5.00 on popsicles (20 x $0.25) and $2.00 on ice cream bars (4 x $0.50).  That means he spent a total of $7.00.


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so a cobra has 70 spots and that's double the number a mamba has. That means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

The 60 mambas have 35 spots each, for a total of 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed 12 players + 3 coaches = 15 people.  Then there's 12 players * 2 guests/player = 24 guests. That's a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, she'll need 39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza is $15, then she'll spend 13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195.


$195 

"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones per necklace, and each one is 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  The whole necklace is 25 inches, so the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.  Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.

"
"Okay, so they wrote a bunch of stories, doubled them, and we need to find the total.

* Week 1: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories
* Week 2: 20 * 2 + 40 * 2 + 60 * 2 = 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories

"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters which is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents.  She also has 2 dimes, so that's 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.  

That means she has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If the pop costs 55 cents, she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.

"
"Okay, so the flag has 76 stars total.  There are 3 rows of 8 stars, which is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Then there are 2 rows of 6 stars, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars.  

That means the 8-star and 6-star rows have 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

If there are 76 stars total and 36 are in the other rows, then there must be 76 - 36 = 40 stars in the rows with 5 stars each.

Since each row has 5 stars, there are 40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars.

"
"Okay, so they need to move 80 flagstones and each one is 75 pounds. That means they're moving 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds of stone.  If each truck can only carry 2000 pounds, they'll need 6000 / 2000 = 3 trucks.

"
"Okay, so the fast car is going 60 miles per hour and goes 480 miles.  To figure out how long that takes, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the fast car took 480 miles / 60 miles per hour = 8 hours.

The slow car is going half the speed, which is 30 miles per hour. Since it's going the same distance, it'll take twice as long.

So, the slow car took 8 hours * 2 = 16 hours.

"Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total (8 packets x 5 bars/packet). The adults get 24 bars (4 adults x 6 bars/adult), leaving 16 bars for the kids.  If they split those evenly, each child gets 2 bars (16 bars / 8 children).


2 

"
"Okay, so Susan works for 3 hours, but she takes a 30-minute break. That means she actually works for 2.5 hours.  

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

She makes $5 for every 10 minutes, so she earns 150 / 10 = $15.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Mike has 21 points.
* Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* Tony has twice as many points as Mike, so he has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

*  Mike and Tony both get an extra point because they have over 20 points.

*  Let's add up all their points: 21 + 18 + 42 + 1 + 1 = 83

"Okay, so Darren does a lot of exercises! 

Let's see... on day two he does 120 pushups (100 + 20), 40 squats (50 - 10), and 40 dumbbell presses (20 x 2).

That means on day two he does 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

Adding that to day one's 170 exercises (100 + 50 + 20), he does a total of 370 exercises in two days.

"
"Okay, so they eat 1 kg of rice per meal since each person eats 0.2 kg and there are 5 people.  They eat twice a day, so that's 2 kg a day.  The 42 kg bag will last them 42 / 2 = 21 days.  That's 21 / 7 = 3 weeks.

"
"Okay, so Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread. He was closed for two days, so he only had five days to sell them.  He sold 20 crates on the weekend, then 15, 12, and 18 more on the other days. That's a total of 65 crates.

To figure out how far off he was, we subtract what he sold from his goal: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.


55 

"
"Okay, so Carmen starts at $200. Then three other people bid, and each time the price goes up by $50.  So that's 3 times $50, which is $150 more.

That means the desk ends up costing her $200 + $150 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, that's 60 miles a day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles a week.

Over a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles.

The driving service charges $2 per mile, so that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for the year.

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so that's $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 a year in bonuses.

In total, John pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year for driving. 


$31,800

"Okay, so Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday combined.  He exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday.

First, I need to find the total time he exercised on Sunday and Monday: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.

Then, I double that amount to see how long he needs to exercise on Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

$15 

"
"Okay, so Elise sold 45 books this year and there are 50 left. That means she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years.  Since she sold twice as many in the first year compared to this year, she sold 200 - 45 = 155 books in the first year.  That means she sold 155 - 45 = 110 books in the second year.

At $20 per book, she made 110 * $20 = $2200 in the second year.


$2200 

"
"Okay, so Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days, that's 50 hours a week. He makes $10 an hour, so that's 50 times 10, which is $500. Plus, he gets an extra $300 because his company is doing well. So in total, he makes $800 a week.

April has 4 weeks, so he made $800 times 4, which is $3200 for the whole month.


$3200

"Okay, so the ice cream is $2 cheaper now, and you're buying two tubs, so that's $2 x 2 = $4 saved there.  Each packet of milk is 50 cents cheaper, and you're getting four packets, so that's $0.50 x 4 = $2 saved on milk.

In total, you'd save $4 + $2 = $6.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

Theo spends $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and his flight costs $1200 (that's 5 times the price of a suit plus $700).  

So, his total spending so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

He wants to save $2000, and he started with $6000, so he has $6000 - $1950 = $4050 left.

That means he has $4050 - $2000 = $2050 for gifts.

The problem says Chile's population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60000 people.

But that was six years ago, and the population has doubled since then, so now Chile has 60000 * 2 = 120000 people.

"
"Okay, so the team has 105 players total.  The offense is double the size of the defense, and the special teams are half the size of the defense.  

Let's say there are *d* players on defense. That means there are 2*d* players on offense and *d*/2 players on special teams.

If we add all those up, it should equal 105:  *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, let's combine the *d* terms: 3.5*d* = 105

Then divide both sides by 3.5: *d* = 30


There are **30** players on defense. 

"
"Okay, so Martha invited a bunch of people. Let's see... 2 families with 6 people each is 12 people. Then 3 families with 4 people each is another 12. So that's 24 people total.

But then 8 people got sick and couldn't come. And 2 more had other things to do.  That means 10 people couldn't make it.

So 24 minus 10 is 14.

"
"Okay, so Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna. That's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. Then his dad gives him 2/5 times the amount he got from Johanna, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

So now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"
"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find out how much water it holds, we need to multiply those numbers together: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  The class has 3 times as many girls as boys, so there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls. There are also 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, meaning there are 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered kids.

To find the total, we add up all the kids: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children.

"
"Okay, so the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. That means for every 3 wires, there's 1 pole.  If they need 45 wires, we can figure out how many sets of 3 wires there are: 45 / 3 = 15.

Since each set of 3 wires needs 1 pole, they'll need 15 poles.

"
"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party.  That's 40 people total. Then a quarter of them left, which is 10 people (40 / 4 = 10).

"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of them aren't in boxes. That means she has 24 pencils in boxes. Since those pencils are split evenly between 3 boxes, each box holds 8 pencils.

Now, Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To figure out how many boxes they need, we divide the total pencils by the number per box: 72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes.

"
"Okay, so Shannon needs to cool her coffee down 65 degrees. Each ice cube takes it down 13 degrees, so she'll need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes it 12 milliliters weaker, so that's 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters/ice cube = 60 milliliters weaker from the ice.

Then she adds 15 milliliters of cream, so it's a total of 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

"Okay, so there are 100 programmers in total.  

We know 2/5 of them are junior programmers, so that's (2/5) * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

Junior programmers make $2000 each, so they cost the company 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 each.

So the seniors cost the company 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

To find the total cost, we add the junior and senior salaries: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.


Answer: 224000 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.  

We know 20 people were on the bus before the third stop. Before that, 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people. Then 8 people got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people on the bus after the first stop.

Since 5 people got on at the first stop, there must have been 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the beginning.

"Okay, let's break this down.

* Oscar starts with 24 lollipops and eats 2, leaving him with 22.
* He gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 left.
* He buys twice the amount he gave away, which is 14 * 2 = 28 more lollipops.
* Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
* He eats 3 more, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33.
* Finally, he eats 2 more, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"Okay, so they got $4 in rewards from spending $80 last time.  Then the coupon saved them double that, so that's $8 more off.  That means they saved a total of $12.  Since their stuff cost $43, they paid $43 - $12 = $31.


$31 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $15 * 2000 = $30,000 before taxes.  But they take out 20% for taxes, so that's $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000 in taxes.  That means Nick would take home $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but they take out $6,000 right off the bat for property tax. That leaves $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then they take 10% for taxes on what's left, so that's $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.  So his take-home pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Job B pays $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 each month for 6 months. So that's 6 * $350 = $2100 for the monthly payments.  In total, that's $2100 + $1350 = $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 each month for 9 months. So that's 9 * $250 = $2250 for the monthly payments.  That makes a total of $2250 + $1100 = $3350.

The difference in price is $3450 - $3350 = $100.

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the stock goes up 50%, which is half of $8, so it goes up $4.  That means each share is now worth $8 + $4 = $12.

Now her shares are worth 8 * $12 = $96.

But then the second year, the stock goes down 25%, which is a quarter of $12, or $3. So each share is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Finally, her shares are worth 8 * $9 = $72.


$72 

"
"Okay, so Thomas ate three times more than Luke, who ate 2 hot dogs. That means Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.  John ate half of what Thomas ate, so he ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"
"Okay, so there are 200 students total, and two of the groups are the same size.  Let's call that size ""x"". The third group is 10 smaller than the other two, so it has ""x - 10"" students.

To find out how many are in each group, we can set up an equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So the two bigger groups each have 70 students. The smaller group has x - 10, which is 70 - 10 = 60 students.


**Answer:** 60 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and we know there are twice as many chickens as cows.  

Let's say there are 'x' cows. That means there are '2x' chickens.

If we add those together, we get the total number of animals: x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we have 3x = 60.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 20 cows.

Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Okay, so Josh starts with 3 balls and adds one each week. That means after four weeks he's juggling 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.

Then he drops 3, but 2 get caught, so he's left with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.


5 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  The beetle and toad are the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds. The snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.


210 

"
"Okay, so Laurel got 24 outfits at first. Then she got double that at her shower, which is 24 * 2 = 48 outfits.  That's a total of 24 + 48 = 72 outfits. Then her mom gave her 15 more, so she has 72 + 15 = 87 outfits.


87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is 1000 meters more (5000 * 1/5 = 1000).

So now he runs 6000 meters a day (5000 + 1000 = 6000).

In June, which has 30 days, he'd run 180,000 meters (6000 * 30 = 180000).


180000 

"
"Okay, so Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, which is $4. So Juice Box B is $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, making it $11.  That means Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.


$2 

"
"Okay, so the restaurant has two types of tables.  Let's see... 40 tables have 4 legs each, so that's 40 times 4, which is 160 legs. Then there are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 50 times 3, which is 150 legs.  

To find the total, we add those together: 160 + 150 = 310 legs.


310 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Together they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.


9 

"
"Okay, so Davos got a good deal!  

Each shirt was originally $30, but he saved 40%, which is $30 * 0.40 = $12 off each shirt. That means each shirt cost him $30 - $12 = $18.

Since he bought two shirts, he paid $18 * 2 = $36 in total.


$36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors (10 tractors * $100 each). Now they make $1100 a day selling silos (5 silos * $220 each).  That's $100 more each day.

To find the percentage increase, I'd do (the increase / the original amount) * 100%. So, ($100 / $1000) * 100% = 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so Madeline spends $25 a week on food, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 a month on food.

Then she spends $20 on treats and $100 on medicine each month.

So in total, it's $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 a month.

Over a year, that's $220 * 12 = $2640.


2640 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* Yoga is an hour.
* Cooking class is three times that, so 3 hours.
* Cheese tasting is half an hour.
* The museum tour is half the cooking class, so 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* Errands take 2 hours.

Adding it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours


8 

"
"Okay, so April needs 30 pots for the daisies and double that for the roses, which is 30 * 2 = 60 pots.  That means she needs a total of 30 + 60 = 90 pots. Since she already has 100, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots leftover.


10 

"
"Okay, so Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and then gave her brother $4.  To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract those amounts from her starting money: $36 - $11 - $4 = $21.

$21 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

John boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, so he swam for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows.

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find the total time, we can set up a proportion: 15 hours / 0.30 = x hours / 1.

Solving for x, we get x = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.


20
"
"Okay, so Annabelle needs $400 and already has $80.  That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Let's see how much she earns.  At her first job, she makes $10 an hour for 20 hours, so that's $10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, she makes $5 an hour for 15 hours, so that's $5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

Finally, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.



$45 

"
"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the next one is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 11 feet.  Together they are 17 feet tall. The tallest tree is twice that, so it's 34 feet tall.


34 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Dean spent $2 on each of his 6 toy cars, so that's 6 * $2 = $12.  He spent $1 on each of his 5 teddy bears, so that's 5 * $1 = $5.  

In total, he spent $12 + $5 = $17.  

He started with $28 and spent $17, leaving him with $28 - $17 = $11.

Then his mom gave him another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21 left.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90 and needs to pay for her own fun too.  Let's see... mini-golf is $5, arcade tokens are $5, and go-karts are $20 (since she wants to ride twice). That's $30 total for Morgan.

That leaves her with $60 for her friends. Since each friend costs $30 to have fun, she can invite 2 friends. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Marisa gets $5 a day and spends $1 on lollipops. That means she saves $4 each day.  Over 5 days, she'd save $4 x 5 = $20.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Billy had $10 and spent some on candy.  We know gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40, so those cost him $2.00 (40 x $0.05 = $2.00).

That means he had $8.00 left after buying candy ($10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00). Since he spent half his change on gumballs, the candy cost $4.00 ($8.00 / 2 = $4.00).

Finally, candy costs $1.50 per pound, so he bought 2.67 pounds of candy ($4.00 / $1.50 = 2.67 pounds).


2.67 

"
"Let's see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 years younger than twice his son's age.  So, twice his son's age is 45 + 5 = 50.  That means his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.


25 

"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles then 100 miles, that's 175 miles total one way.  Then it goes 50 miles less coming back, so that's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.  

So a full round trip is 175 + 125 = 300 miles.

If it does that three times a day, it travels 300 * 3 = 900 miles each day.

To figure out how many days until it needs service, we divide the total miles it can go before service by the miles per day: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.


20 

"
"Okay, so a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (because it's the average of 8 and 2).  

He needs 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds (4 beds * 2 pounds/bed) and 15 pounds for the collie beds (3 beds * 5 pounds/bed).

That's a total of 23 pounds of stuffing. 

23 

"
"Okay, so John drives 210 miles to his friend's house (200 miles + 10 miles detour) at 70 mph. That takes him 3 hours (210 / 70 = 3).

Then he drives 240 miles back home at 80 mph, which also takes 3 hours (240 / 80 = 3).

So the whole trip took 6 hours (3 + 3).


6 

"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* First, find out how many boys are in the fourth grade: 96 total students - 43 girls = 53 boys
* Then, subtract the boys who were absent: 53 boys - 4 absent boys = 49 boys


49 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, meaning there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  

In total, there are 6 + 12 = 18 kids in the park. 

18 

"
"Okay, so Jane needs at least 42 points to pass. She already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test.


9 

"
"Okay, so 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then 3 times 4 minus 5, which is 7, got kicked out for shoplifting.  That's a total of 10 people. Then 7 times 3, which is 21, got kicked out for fighting over stuff. That's 31 people in total.

Since 50 people got kicked out, that means 50 minus 31 equals 19 people got kicked out for other reasons. 


19 

"
"Okay, so Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8 points.  That means Erin had 3 * 8 = 24 points before she scored more.  Since she scored 14 points, she must have had 24 - 14 = 10 points to start.


10
"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much all the senior gifts will cost.

* The picture frames are $20 each, and there are 44 seniors, so that's 44 * $20 = $880.
* Etching each frame costs an extra 20%, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  So etching all the frames will cost 44 * $4 = $176.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
* A quarter of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each cord costs $12, so the cords will cost 11 * $12 = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198


$1198
"
"Okay, so the wallpaper costs $400, and making it yourself saves you 20%.  That means you save $400 * 0.20 = $80.

So, if Ethan makes it himself, it'll cost him $400 - $80 = $320.


$320 

"
"Okay, so they sold 14 pairs on Friday. Then on Saturday, they sold twice that amount, which is 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.  On Sunday, they sold half of what they did on Saturday, so that's 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. But then 6 people returned their shoes, so they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs on Sunday.

To find the total, we add up the sales for each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesdays, 2 hours on Thursdays, and then twice the Tuesday time on Saturdays, which is another 2 hours.  

Adding those up, she dances for a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours a week. 

5 

"
"Okay, so they bought $400,000 worth of equipment, but 40% was bad.  That means they paid for $400,000 - (40/100)*$400,000 = $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000 worth of good equipment.


$240,000
"
"Okay, so Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg each.  

That means 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk, for a total of 15 kg.

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk.

Adding those together, Mary gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens.  She cuts each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so that's 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.


48 

"
"Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 students.  That leaves 40 - 20 = 20 students who like other colors.

If a quarter of those remaining like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 students.

That means 20 - 5 = 15 students like yellow. 


15
"
"Okay, so Lucy made $56 selling apples on Monday, and each apple costs $4. That means she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and on Wednesday, she picked double that amount, so she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

In total, she picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples over the three days.


50 

"
"Okay, so Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (10 * 2 = 20).  She also washed 15 individual socks. That's a total of 35 socks (20 + 15 = 35).

If she started with 50 socks and washed 35, she's missing 15 socks (50 - 35 = 15).


15
"
"Okay, so Rachel starts with 23 cookies and gets 42 more, that's 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. Then her brother eats 44, so she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.


21
"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed $3650 and has to pay it back over 5 months with 10% interest.  

First, we gotta figure out how much interest she's paying. That's Principal times Rate times Time, all divided by 100. So, it's $3650 * 10 * 5 / 100, which equals $1825.

Now, add the interest to the original amount: $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, divide that total by the number of months to find out her monthly payment: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


Answer: 1095 

"
"Okay, so Cho hiked for a longer time and at a faster speed.  

* Cho's total distance: 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers
* Chloe's total distance: 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers
* Difference: 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers

Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 


67
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.
* She also has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* Together they have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos.
* And they have 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.
* That means they have a total of 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.


350
"
"Okay, so Millie spends $18 on supplies and makes 36 cups of lemonade (3 pitchers x 12 cups). She sells each cup for $1, so she'll make $36 total.

Since she sells 4 cups an hour, it takes her 9 hours to sell everything (36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours).

Her profit per hour is then $2 because she makes $36 and it takes her 9 hours ($36 - $18 = $18, then $18 / 9 hours = $2/hour).


$2 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left, and that's 2/5 of his original land.  To find out how much he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) 
Original Land = 32 hectares 


32
"
"Okay, so half the choir are girls, which is 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  Then half of them can't make it, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls who are out. That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls to sing. Plus the 3 teachers, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.


16 

"
"Okay, so to find Wilson's average math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

400 / 5 = 80

His math grade is an 80. 

80 

"
"Okay, so 6 erasers at $2 each would cost $12.  And 8 pencils at $3 each would be $24.  Adding those together, 6 erasers and 8 pencils would cost $36.


36 

"
"Okay, so James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers 1/3 of that amount to Mr. Yu, which is 66 / 3 = 22 messages.  

In total, he delivers 66 + 22 = 88 messages.


88 

"
"Okay, so David gets the bracelet for $30 and can ride all the rides. Dasha has to buy 18 tickets (9 rides x 2 tickets/ride) which costs $36 (18 tickets x $2/ticket).  

David saved $6 because $36 - $30 = $6.


6
"
"Okay, so Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap (6 + 4 + 2).  If she has 144 inches of ribbon, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per gift.


12 

"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam's popsicles are in a 5:6 ratio, and they have a total of 165.  

To figure out how many more popsicles Sam has, we need to see how many popsicles each ""part"" of the ratio represents.  

* First, add the ratio parts: 5 + 6 = 11
* Then divide the total popsicles by the sum of the ratio parts: 165 popsicles / 11 = 15 popsicles per part.

* Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles
* Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles

Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.


15
"
"Okay, so Tim's cable is $60 a month.  Netflix is $10. Hulu and Disney+ are each $10, but he gets a deal for bundling them. That's $20 total, but he saves 20% which is $4. So the bundle is $16.  

Adding Netflix, that's $16 + $10 = $26 for all his streaming.

He saves $60 - $26 = $34 by switching.


$34 

"
"Okay, so Carol spent 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording (half the writing time), and 1.5 hours editing.  That's a total of 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100%:

(1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%


20 

"
"Okay, so Wendy wants to double the number of spaces in the shelving system, which has 6 rows and 6 columns. That means there are 6 * 6 = 36 spaces.

Then she wants to add 20 more books on top of that, so she'll need 36 * 2 + 20 = 92 books.


92 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Erica starts with 20 cards and her dad gives her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 more cards.  That means she has 20 + 30 = 50 cards total.

She gives out 24 to classmates and 5 to family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.  

That leaves her with 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

Finally, she gets 17 more cards, bringing her total to 21 + 17 = 38 cards.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jenny starts with 12 slices. Bill gets a third, which is 4 slices (12 / 3 = 4). Mark gets a quarter, which is 3 slices (12 / 4 = 3).  That's 7 slices gone already (4 + 3 = 7).  If Jenny eats 2, there are 3 left (12 - 7 - 2 = 3).


3 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs $250 more to buy the bike. If he saves $10 each day, it will take him 25 days to save up enough. 


25
"
"Okay, so Nancy saw 90 spiders.  She saw 1/3 that many millipedes, which is 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes. Then she saw twice the number of millipedes minus 12 stink bugs, so that's (30 * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

To find the total, we add up all the bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs.


168 

"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, making her 35. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so she's 42. That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica.


12
"
"Okay, so John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass has 8 ounces. That's 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk total.

Since each ounce has 3 calories, he drinks 16 * 3 = 48 calories.


48 

"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month, and that's 4 times 6 days, which is 24 days a month.  In a year, that's 24 days/month * 12 months = 288 days.

If he makes $50 a day, then he earns 288 days * $50/day = $14,400 a year.


$14,400 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs four times the normal amount of ingredients. That means he needs 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since each bag has 2 cups, he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups.  Each bottle has 2 cups, so he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mel saves 5 hours of AC use each day.  That means he's saving 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours every day.  

To figure out how many kilowatt-hours that is, we divide by 1000: 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours.

Over 30 days, he'd save 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.


135 

"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, which is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes and another with 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  That means all the zebras have a total of 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average number of stripes per zebra is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes.


22 

"
"Okay, so Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he'll need 5 pounds of each.

Meat costs $7 per pound, so that's 5 * $7 = $35.

Cheese is $3 per pound, so that's 5 * $3 = $15.

In total, he'll spend $35 + $15 = $50 on meat and cheese. 


$50.00
"
"Okay, so Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, which is 80 corns. Then he buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 100.  He buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, so he gets 60 corns.  That means he has 140 corns in total (80 + 60).  Adding that to his 100 cannolis, he has 240 corns and cannolis altogether.


240 

"
"Okay, so Elliott wants to get 10,000 steps. He does half on his way to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he does another 1,000 with his friend. That's a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.  If he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have done 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps jogging.


2,000
"
"Okay, so Toby has a 45-page book with 200 words on each page, that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total.

He reads 300 words a minute, so it'll take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

He needs 10 minutes to get to the airport, so that's 30 + 10 = 40 minutes total.

He has a whole hour (60 minutes) before he needs to be there, so he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 people in May and paid them $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's like $15 times 40, which is $600 a week.  Then times that by 4 weeks in a month, so $600 times 4 is $2400 per person for May.

That means they paid out $2400 times 40 people, which is $96,000 in May.

In June, a quarter of the people left, so 40 divided by 4 is 10 people left. That means 40 - 10 = 30 people were still working.

They still made $2400 each, so the company paid $2400 times 30 people, which is $72,000 in June.

To find the total, we add the May and June amounts: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000


$168,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The taffy deal is a little tricky.  Two pounds would normally cost $6, but since the second pound is half off, it's $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The magnets cost $0.25 each, and she got 4, so that's $1.00.

In total, she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

If she started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, she has $3.00 left.


$3.00
"
"Okay, so Tim bought one pack of fireworks for $400 and another for double that, which is $800.  That's a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.

He got a 20% discount, so he saved $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

That means he paid $1200 - $240 = $960 for the two packs.

Then he bought a finale firework for $150, so his total spending was $960 + $150 = $1110.


$1110
"
"Okay, so Shannon needs enough cookies for 30 days and eats 2 each night. That's 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

Since each batch makes a dozen, which is 12 cookies, she'll need to make 60 / 12 = 5 batches. 


5 

"
"Okay, so 1% of her candles will explode, which is 500 candles (50000 x 0.01 = 500).  Then, 5% of those exploding candles will smell like wet dog, so that's 25 candles (500 x 0.05 = 25).


25 

"
"Okay, so each blouse is normally $20, but they're 30% off.  That means each one is $6 cheaper ($20 x 0.30 = $6).

So each blouse on sale costs $14 ($20 - $6 = $14).

Since she's buying 4 blouses, the total cost is $56 ($14 x 4 = $56).


$56 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Joanne gets 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gets double the tall tree apples (30 * 2 = 60) and triple the short tree apples (15 * 3 = 45).

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees.  That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.


350
"
"Okay, so we've got camels and dromedaries, right? Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's say there are 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries.

We know:

*  There are 180 heads total: c + d = 180
* There are 304 humps total: 2c + d = 304

To figure out how many dromedaries there are, we can use a little algebra.

If we subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180

This simplifies to: c = 124

Now we can plug that back into either of the original equations to find 'd'. Let's use the first one:

124 + d = 180

So, d = 56


There are **56** dromedaries. 

"
"Okay, so Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, which is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Then he traveled 30% of that distance over the next two days, so that's 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He didn't travel at all on the next day, so that's zero kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, which is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

To find the total distance, we add up all the distances: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


3140
"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and that's a quarter the size of Zack's.  That means Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.  Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's, so it's 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.


3000 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him double that, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

Adding that to the money he already had, he has $12000 + $5000 = $17000 now.


$17000 

"
"Okay, so 4 boats took 20 cats (4 x 5 = 20). That leaves 30 cats (50 - 20 = 30). Then, 18 cats ran off (30 x 3/5 = 18).  So there were 12 cats left (30 - 18 = 12).


12 

"
"Okay, so Bill's bill is a little tricky.  

* The first part is easy: 6 months at $8 is 6 * $8 = $48.
* Then it goes up to $12 for 8 months, so that's 8 * $12 = $96.
* Finally, it goes up again to $14 for another 8 months, which is 8 * $14 = $112.

To get the total, we add those all up: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.


256
"
"Okay, so Cole got a deal on both pairs of jeans.  The jogger jeans were $6 cheaper than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. That means the joggers were $28 - $6 = $22.

To figure out how much more the joggers originally cost, we need to know how much they were before the sale.  We know he saved $6 total, and $2 of that was from the joggers. So the joggers were originally $22 + $2 = $24.

That means the joggers were $24 - $28 = -$4 more than the tattered jeans. 


-4
"
"Okay, so they have some big buses that hold 60 people each, and they have 4 of those. That's 4 times 60, which is 240 people. Then there are smaller buses that hold 30 people, and they have 6 of those, so that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people.  And lastly, they have minivans that hold 15 people each, and they have 10 of those. So that's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

If you add all those up, 240 + 180 + 150 equals 570.


570 

"
"Okay, so Lillian has 3 homemade feeders that each attract 20 birds, plus 10 extra because the birds like them better. That's 3 * (20 + 10) = 90 birds.  Then she has 3 store-bought feeders that each attract 20 birds, so that's 3 * 20 = 60 birds. In total, she can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds.


150 

"
"Okay, so the soup cost $4 plus 25%, which is like adding a dollar ($4 x 0.25 = $1). So the soup was $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it was $2.  Adding up the bagel, soup, and cake, Aleksandra paid $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.


11
"
"Okay, so Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over after, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.

If he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since you can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total.  To find the total, we can do 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.


50 

"
"Okay, so the caterer had enough for 18 people to have two hot dogs, which is 36 hot dogs.  He also had 18 more hot dogs, for a total of 54.  But 40 people showed up, and only half of those 54 hot dogs would give people seconds. So 54 / 2 = 27 people could get a second hot dog. That means 40 - 27 = 13 people didn't get seconds.


13 

"
"Okay, so Indras' name has 6 letters.  Half of that is 3, and her sister's name has 4 more than that, so it has 7 letters.  Together, that's 6 + 7 = 13 letters.


13 

"
"Okay, so Charlotte's pots and pans are $120, the bowls are $20, and the utensils are 5 times $5, which is $25.  That's a total of $120 + $20 + $25 = $165 before the discount.

Since everything is 20% off, we take 20% of $165, which is $33.  

Finally, we subtract the discount from the original price: $165 - $33 = $132.


$132.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The skipping rope, game, and ball cost $6 + $11 + $2 = $19 in total.

Dora has $2 + $16 = $18.

She needs $19 - $18 = $1 more. 


$1 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur got 3/4 of that, so he killed 75 dragons. Prince Walter doubled Arthur's amount, meaning he killed 150 dragons. Finally, Prince Bruce killed 1/5 of what Walter did, so he killed 30 dragons.


30 

"
"Okay, so first you gotta figure out how much gas is in each container.  If they split 15 gallons into 5 containers, that's 3 gallons per container.

Josey needs a quarter of a container, so that's 3 gallons * 0.25 = 0.75 gallons.

Finally, there are 8 pints in a gallon, so she needs 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints of gas.


6 

"
"Okay, so George spent $5 and had 1% left over, which is 5 cents. That means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so that's 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

That leaves $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 for candy bars.

Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars. 


5 

"
"Ray shared his lollipops with his friends, so he gave away 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.  Since he has 4 friends, each friend gets 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.


5 

"
"Okay, so Rory starts with 20 ounces of cake and cuts it into 8 pieces.  She and her mom eat 2 pieces, leaving 6 pieces. Since the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces.  That means the remaining cake weighs 6 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 15 ounces.


15 

"
"Okay, so Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.  They're sharing with 6 friends, so there are 8 people in total. If they split the oranges evenly, each person gets 56 / 8 = 7 oranges.


7 

"
"Okay, so Antoine needs double the onions, which is 2 pounds times 2, so that's 4 pounds of onions.  Those onions will cost him 4 times $2, which is $8. The beef stock is $2 a box and he needs 2 boxes, so that's another $4.  In total, his ingredients cost $8 + $4 = $12.  Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12 divided by 6, which is $2. 


$2 

"
"Okay, so Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, which takes 4 minutes. That means her drive is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

She also wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before him.


21 

"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We know that to find the area of a rectangle, you multiply length times width. Since the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet, we can divide the area by the length to find the width: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides. That's 2 * (length + width) or 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.


98 

"
"Okay, so Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) and 2 packs of clear beads (40 beads), for a total of 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (60 beads) and 4 packs of red beads (80 beads), giving her 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 


80
"
"Okay, so the house starts at 40 degrees. Baking for 3 hours makes it hotter by 15 degrees (5 degrees per hour times 3 hours). So now it's 55 degrees.

Opening the window for 30 minutes cools it down by 6 degrees (2 degrees every 10 minutes, and 30 minutes is three 10-minute chunks).

That means the final temperature is 49 degrees. 


49
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Jon took 40 minutes swimming, 80 minutes biking, and 50 minutes running, for a total of 170 minutes.

James was 10% faster swimming, so he took 40 * 0.10 = 4 minutes less, meaning he swam in 36 minutes.

James took 5 minutes longer biking than Jon, so he biked for 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon beat James by 10 minutes, so James took 170 - 10 = 160 minutes total.

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.



**Answer:** 39 

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 80 minutes divided by 4. That means Movie A is 20 minutes long.


20
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we gotta see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, his change is $30 - $24 = $6.



$6
"
"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 times 12, or 48 eggs.  She also has 2 more eggs, so that's a total of 50 eggs.  Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, or 2 trays.


2 

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, putting him at 240 points. Marcy starts with 225 and gets 10 more, for a total of 235 points.  To see how much Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's: 240 - 235 = 5.

5 

"
"Okay, so the salesman spent $576 on the sneakers. He made $340 from the flash sale and then another $775 from the department store.  That means he made a total of $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find his profit, we subtract what he spent from what he made: $1115 - $576 = $539.


$539 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice has two types of crayon packs.  She has six packs with 8 crayons each, so that's 6 * 8 = 48 crayons. Then she has four packs with 16 crayons each, which is 4 * 16 = 64 crayons.  In total, she has 48 + 64 = 112 crayons.


112 

"
"Okay, so the super ticket is $21, and you saved $2 by not getting it. That means the regular price for the ticket and snacks was $19.  The ticket itself is $12, and the soda is $3, so the popcorn must have cost $4. 


$4 

"
"Okay, so the balloons originally cost $900 for 20 of them, which means each balloon cost $45.  Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $65. If Bentley buys 170 balloons, it'll cost him $65 times 170, which is $11050.


$11050 

"
"Okay, so to find the average speed, we need to think about the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

It went 60 mph for 2 hours, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

Then it went 30 mph for 1 hour, which is another 30 miles.

In total, it traveled 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

So, the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.


50
"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3, leaving her with 5. Those are worth 5 * $800 = $4000. She got 2 rubies in the trade, which are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  Adding those together, all her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400.


$6400 

"
"Okay, so they each eat 4 apples a day, and there are two of them, so that's 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day total.  

Over 30 days, they'd eat 8 * 30 = 240 apples.


240 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs a lot of potting soil!  

Let's see... each bed holds 2 feet times 8 feet times 2 feet, which is 32 cubic feet of soil. Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 times 10, or 320 cubic feet total.

Each bag has 2 cubic feet, so he needs 320 divided by 2, which is 160 bags.

If each bag costs $12, then 160 bags will cost 160 times $12, which is $1920. 


$1920
"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  There are 60% more green cards than red cards, so that's 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

The number of yellow cards is the same as the total number of red and green cards, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.


78 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 fairies at first. Then 25 more came, so there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  Then 30 flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

"
"Okay, so there are 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  Out of those, 3 + 4 = 7 have spots.  

To find the percentage, we do (7 / 20) * 100% = 35%


35 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds (2 boxes * 1 pound/box).
* The carrots weigh 48 pounds (4 bags * 12 pounds/bag).
* The hay weighs a lot: 3150 pounds (42 bales * 75 pounds/bale).
* The oats weigh 1300 pounds (20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack).

Adding it all up, the total weight is 4500 pounds (2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300).

Since his truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, he'll need to make 2 trips (4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip). 


2 

"
"Okay, so Grayson makes 2 cents for each can and 3 cents for each bottle. She recycles 3 cans and 5 bottles a week.

That means she makes 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents from cans each week.

And she makes 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents from bottles each week.

So in total, she makes 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents each week.

Over a month, that's 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents.


84 

"
"Okay, so Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. That means Toni has 10 plants + (60/100)*10 plants = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so Shondra has 16 plants - 7 plants = 9 plants.


9 

"
"Leila gave Ali half of her money, which is $100 / 2 = $50.

Ali started with $21 and got $50 more, so now he has $21 + $50 = $71.


$71 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's pizza was $15.  To figure out a tip that's 1/5 of that, you divide the cost by 5: $15 / 5 = $3.

So, her tip would be $3.  

To find the total, you add the tip to the original price: $15 + $3 = $18.

Ashley should give the delivery person $18. 


$18
"
"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she falls back 5 spots, putting her in 6th place. She moves up 2 spots to 4th, then falls back 3 spots to 7th. Finally, she moves up one spot to finish in 6th place.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 cards each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

She also has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 cards each, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students. 


30
"
"Okay, so Becky spent $8.00 on her apples because they were 45 cents each and she got a dollar off. Kelly's apples cost $10.00 before her discount, but she saved 10%, which is a dollar. So she paid $9.00.  That means Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so each room has 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillowcases + 8 towels, which is 15 pieces of laundry.  If there are 80 rooms, that's 15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.


1200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* He starts with 200 shoes.
* He gets 5 pairs (that's 10 shoes) on Monday, so he has 210.
* Then he gets 15 more pairs (30 shoes) on Wednesday, bringing his total to 240.
* On Friday, he gets another 30 pairs (60 shoes), so he has 300 shoes.
* But then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, leaving him with 120.


120 

"
"Okay, so Mary has enough sprinkles for 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.  Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.


4 

"
"Okay, so the paper cost three times the price of the pen minus a dollar, right?  So the paper was 3 * $2 - $1 = $5.

That means the total cost was $2 + $5 = $7.

If she paid with a $10 bill, her change is $10 - $7 = $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, so there were 30 students with 10 pencils each, that's 300 pencils to start. After two months, they used up 1/5 of them, which is 60 pencils.  That leaves 240 pencils. Then at the end of the year, only 1/3 of those were left. So, 240 pencils times 1/3 is 80 pencils.


**Answer:** 80 

"
"Okay, so Matt wants 5 cookies.  His dad said he gets half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.  

That means if we take away the 2 extra cookies, he's getting 3 cookies from the carrot sticks (5 - 2 = 3).

Since that 3 cookies is half the number of carrot sticks, he must eat 6 carrot sticks (3 x 2 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so the shark is 10 feet long, which is 120 inches. The two remoras together are 12 inches long.  To find the percentage, we do (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%.


10

"
"Okay, so Jason has 3 weeks to break in his shoes, which is 21 days.  He wants to walk 4 days a week, so that's 21 * 4 = 84 days total.

He needs to walk for 240 minutes, so he should walk for 240 / 84 = 2.86 minutes each day.


2.86 

"
"Okay, so Sarah spent $300 and each book cost $15.  That means she bought $300 / $15 = 20 books.

Since she gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids, each kid got 20 books / 4 kids = 5 books.


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 32 kids total.  

We know 9 are allergic to dairy, but 3 of those are also allergic to peanuts. So, 9 - 3 = 6 kids are allergic to just dairy.

Then 6 are allergic to peanuts, and we already counted the 3 who are allergic to both, so 6 - 3 = 3 kids are allergic to just peanuts.

That means 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 kids have some kind of allergy.

So, 32 - 12 = 20 kids aren't allergic to anything. 


20
"
"Okay, so they have 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. That's 3 * 200 = 600 employees going.

Then they have 7 tour guides for each group, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 tour guides.

In total, there are 600 + 21 = 621 people going on the tour. 


621
"
"Okay, so the hotel is normally $1500 a night, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend.  That means the markup is $1500 times 0.20, which is $300 extra per night. So each night costs $1500 + $300 = $1800.

For three nights, the hotel costs $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets are $5000 each, and there are two people, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane tickets, the total cost of the trip is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.


$15400 

"
"Okay, so Jasper has half the blue paint Ben has, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes. He has three times the yellow paint Ben has, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tubes.  In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.

11 

"
"Okay, so the 2010 penny is 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  That means the 2010 penny weighs (3/4) * 48 grains = 36 grains.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of both pennies: 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.


84 

"
"Okay, so they need to raise $200 total.  Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.  They need $200 - $174 = $26 more.


$26 

"
"Okay, so Luri has 3 times the songs Gabriel has, which is 20 songs * 3 = 60 songs.

That means Luri can add 100 songs - 60 songs = 40 more songs to his player.

Gabriel can add 100 songs - 20 songs = 80 more songs.

So, Gabriel can add 80 songs - 40 songs = 40 more songs than Luri.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 oranges.

Since he pays $10 for each orange, he gave up 24 * $10 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Jillian's bag cost 3 times the price of her shoes minus $20.  Her shoes were $80, so 3 times that is $240. Then you subtract 20 bucks, and her bag cost $220.


$220 

"
"Okay, so James runs 12 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week. That means he runs 12 * 5 = 60 miles every week.

Since he runs at 10 miles per hour, he runs for a total of 60 / 10 = 6 hours a week.


6 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses, and each one eats 5 pounds of oats per meal. He feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds of oats per horse each day.

Since he has four horses, he needs 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds of oats per day.

Over five days, that's 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he'll need 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags of oats.


4 

"
"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. That means she has 27 * (2/3) = 18 Pomeranians.  

Then, one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, so she has 18 * (1/3) = 6 girl Pomeranians.


6 

"
"Okay, so we need to find the average highest temperature.  

First, add up the temperatures: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Then, divide that by the number of countries, which is 3: -30 / 3 = -10


-10
"
"Okay, so the toy car costs $12 and he already has $4. That means he needs $8 more.  If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days to save enough money. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jaime can fit 24 eggs per tray and he has two trays, meaning he has space for 24 * 2 = 48 eggs.  Since he only has 64 eggs, he'll have 64 - 48 = 16 eggs leftover.


16 

"
"Okay, so the family-size pizza costs three times more than the small pizza, which is $8.  That means the family-size pizza costs $8 * 3 = $24.

To find the total cost, we add the price of both pizzas: $8 + $24 = $32.


$32 

"
"Okay, so Heather's getting a pretty good deal on razors! 

Here's how to figure out the cost per razor:

* She buys two packs, and each pack has 4 razors, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 razors total.
* The razors are buy one get one free, so she's really only paying for one pack, which is $4.00.
* She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.
*  That means each razor costs $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25.

To get the answer in cents, we multiply by 100, so each razor costs 25 cents. 


25
"
"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the total height of all the cheerleaders is (9 * 64) + 60 = 636 inches.

To figure out how tall the pyramid is, we need to think about how the cheerleaders are stacked.  It's like a triangle!  

Since we're converting to feet, we divide the total height in inches by 12: 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.


53 

"
"Okay, so Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. Since she works 8 hours a day, that's 8 walks a day times 5 minutes each, which is 40 minutes of walking per day.  Over 5 days, she walks a total of 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.


200 

"
"Okay, so Angela will be three times Brett's age in four years. That means in four years, she'll be 14 * 3 = 42 years old.  Since she'll be 42 in four years, she's currently 42 - 4 = 38 years old.


38 

"
"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day and spends $6 in the morning and $2 in the afternoon. That's $8 total each day.

Over 14 days, he spends $8/day * 14 days = $112.


112 

"
"Okay, so Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges with 10 in each, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more than that, so she had 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.  Together they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.


40 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out when the cost of both places is the same.

The first place costs $200 no matter what, plus $5 per person for food. So, if 'x' is the number of people, the total cost there is $200 + $5x.

The second place is $25 per person, so the total cost there is $25x.

We want to know when these two costs are equal, so we can set them equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for 'x'. Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

We know they found a total of 43 insects. Let's use some letters to represent how many each person found:

* Bodhi: B
* David: D
* Lily: L

We're told a few things that can help us figure this out:

* Lily found 7 more than David:  L = D + 7
* David found half of what Bodhi found: D = B / 2

And we know: L + D + B = 43

Now we can use substitution to solve for how many insects Lily found.

Since D = B/2, we can put that into the first equation: L = (B/2) + 7

Then we can put both of those into the total equation: (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Let's simplify that: 2B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides: 2B = 36

Divide both sides by 2: B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects.

Now we can find David's insects: D = B/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, Lily's insects: L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



Lily found 16 insects. 

"
"Okay, so Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, which is 364 yards / 4 = 91 yards. Her grandma used half, so that's 364 yards / 2 = 182 yards.  

To find the total, we add those together: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.


273 

"
"Okay, so Cherrie's buying gifts for her friends. Two friends want five gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.  The other three friends each want two gifts, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.  

In total, she bought 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. Then she gets 10 more, for a grand total of 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.


26 

"
"Okay, so the rug is 5 feet wider than the 3-foot chair, which means it's 8 feet wide.  Then, twice the width of the rug is 16 feet.  The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so it's 18 feet long.


18 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and the rest of her gum cost $3 total. That means the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.  Since she bought two packs of strawberry, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Frederick wants the most popsicle sticks for his money.  He can get more sticks per dollar from the 2x8 wood, so he should buy that.  

He has $24, and each 2x8 costs $6, so he can buy 4 of them. Each 2x8 makes 400 sticks, so he can make a total of 1600 popsicle sticks.


1600 

"
"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. That means he needs a total of 6 * 4 = 24 snowshoes.

If each pair costs $12.00, then 24 snowshoes will cost 24 / 2 * $12.00 = $144.00


$144.00 

"
"Okay, so Janet takes two bus rides a day, and each ride is $2.20. That means she spends $4.40 every day on the bus.  

Over a whole week, that's $4.40 times 5 days, which is $22.00.

But if she buys a weekly pass for $20.00, she'd save $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which has 30. So the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which has 20. That means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

The farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Together, they have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times more than Sophia.  That means Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought. So Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.


4 

"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July.  That's a lot!  

He needs to burn 3500 calories for every pound he loses, so that's 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories total.

There are about 200 days until July, so he needs to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories less than he eats every day.


525 

"
"Okay, so Gerald makes $30 each day and he worked for a whole week, which is 7 days.  That means he earned $30 x 7 = $210.

Then he spent $100, so he has $210 - $100 = $110 left.


$110 

"
"Okay, so Hannah runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, so she runs a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers.

She needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer, so for 2 kilometers she'll need 2 * 60 = 120 ml of water.


120 

"
"Okay, so Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, which is $100 (20/100 * $500 = $100).  That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs, which is another $100 (25/100 * $400 = $100).  So, she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the house and lot together cost $120,000, and the house is three times as expensive as the lot.  

To figure out the house price, let's think of it like this:

*  If the lot cost $1, the house would cost $3.
* Together, that's $1 + $3 = $4.

Since they cost $120,000 total, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 4, equals 120,000.

$120,000 divided by 4 is $30,000.

So the lot costs $30,000, and the house costs 3 times that, which is $90,000.


$90,000
"
"Okay, so Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.

She spent $4 on each pack, so that's 8 * $4 = $32 on all the bags.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.


$288 

"
"Okay, so Joe throws a lot of punches!  

He throws 25 punches every minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  That means he throws 25 * 3 = 75 punches per round.

Since there are 5 rounds, he throws a total of 75 * 5 = 375 punches.


375 

"
"Here's how to figure that out:

* Josh made a quarter of the cookies Suzanne made, so he made 36 cookies / 4 = 9 cookies.
* Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh, meaning she made 9 cookies * 2 = 18 cookies.


18
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Ali has four $10 bills, so that's 4 * $10 = $40.

He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.

That means he has a total of $40 + $120 = $160.

He gives half to his sister, so he gives away $160 / 2 = $80.

That leaves him with $160 - $80 = $80.

He spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

So, after buying dinner, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

"Okay, so Martha needs to make a lot of stuff!  

Let's see... each kid needs 2 skeins for a hat + 4 for a scarf + 12 for a sweater + 1 for mittens + 2 for socks. That's 21 skeins per kid.

Since she has three kids, she'll need 21 x 3 = 63 skeins of wool.

"
"Okay, so Chris has a lot of math homework! Let's see...

* He did 12 problems on Monday, and then 3 times that on Tuesday, which is 12 * 3 = 36 problems.
* That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.
* He started with 100, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.
* On Wednesday, he finished 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
* That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"
"Okay, so Tony picks 6 quarts an hour. Bobby picks one less, so he gets 5 quarts an hour. Kathy picks twice what Bobby does, which is 10 quarts an hour. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts an hour.  

To find the total, we add up how much everyone picks: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.


29 

"
"Okay, so they baked 200 loaves, sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, that's a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.  

Then they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. But the store brought back 6, so they ended up with 68 - 6 = 62 loaves.


62 

"
"Okay, so Jackson has 36 red tulips and wants to plant 6 in each row, so that's 36 / 6 = 6 rows for the red tulips.  He has 24 blue tulips and plants 8 per row, so that's 24 / 8 = 3 rows for the blue tulips. In total, he'll have 6 + 3 = 9 rows of tulips.


9 

"
"Okay, so Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to split them evenly between three things. That means each recipe gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins, so she can make 9 / (3/4) = 12 batches of cookies.


12 

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatt-hours each day, and that costs her $18.00 (12 x $1.50).  If she adds the new thing, it'll be 14 kilowatt-hours a day, which is $21.00 (14 x $1.50).

That means her bill will go up by $3.00 each day. Over a week, that's $21.00 more (3 x 7).


$21.00 

"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  If you have 5 people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd do 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 more chairs than sofas, which is 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.  Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, meaning she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

In total, they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas and 22 + 66 = 88 chairs. That means they have a total of 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs.

"Okay, so Tom spent $44 on headphones, which is the same as buying 11 CDs. 


11 

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks. That's 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Then he did 5 hours for two weeks straight, so that's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And one week he did 6 hours.

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours


40 

"
"Okay, so here's how I'd figure this out:

* **Start:** There are 48 people on the bus.
* **Stop 1:** 8 people get off, so there are 48 - 8 = 40 left. Then 8 * 5 = 40 people get on, for a total of 40 + 40 = 80 people.
* **Stop 2:** 21 people get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 people. Then 8 / 3 = 2.67 people get on. Since you can't have part of a person, we'll round down to 2. So there are 59 + 2 = 61 people left.


**61** 

"
"Okay, so Jame is turning 27 in 5 years, which means he's 22 now.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, so the cousin will be 55.  That means the cousin is 47 now (55 - 8).  The difference in their ages is 25 years. 


25
"
"Okay, so Errol spent $1100 on the computer and $400 less on the printer, which means the printer cost $700.  Together, the computer and printer cost $1800.  That leaves $600 for the two monitors.  If we split that evenly, each monitor cost $300.


$300 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 girls. The boys each found 60 shells, and the girls found 60 + (4 * 60) = 300 shells total.  That means each girl found 300 / 10 = 30 shells.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10. That means Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.


8 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
* The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, making it 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.
* To find the total thickness, we add up the thickness of all four books: 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm.


188 

"
"Okay, so Emma wants to make 72 vlogs this month.  She's already made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first half.  That means he needs to figure out how much to save in the first half and then double it for the second half.

Since April has 30 days, each half has 15 days.  He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month.

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we divide: $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 per day.


$37.50

"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The apples cost 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
* The oranges cost 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
* The peaches cost 6 * $0.75 = $4.50
*  In total, that's $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

"Okay, so Jairus makes $0.80 for each task and Jenny makes $0.50. They both do 20 tasks.

To find out how much more Jairus makes, we need to figure out how much he earns total, then how much Jenny earns total, and then subtract.

* Jairus: $0.80/task * 20 tasks = $16.00
* Jenny: $0.50/task * 20 tasks = $10.00
* Difference: $16.00 - $10.00 = $6.00


$6.00
"
"Okay, so Jeff gets 4 times more than Brad.  That means if we think of Brad's money as 1 part, Jeff gets 4 parts. That's a total of 5 parts.

Since they split $100, each ""part"" is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Jeff gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 * $20 = $80.


Answer: 80 

"
"Okay, so Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home, which is a total of 6 miles each day. If he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles.

"Okay, so Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. Then she writes half the alphabet, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 letters.  

So far, she's written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Then she writes all those letters again, so that's another 65 letters.

In total, she wrote 65 + 65 = 130 letters.

"Okay, so Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's a total of 30 pounds (10 * 3 = 30).  If he weighed 70 pounds at the end, he must have weighed 100 pounds to start (70 + 30 = 100).


100 

"
"Okay, so Jonathan wants a playset five times bigger than James's. That means he wants 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  Since he needs 2 more toys to get to that number, he must have 400 - 2 = 398 toys right now.

398 

"
"Okay, so Daniel needs to buy a bunch of stuff for his engineering classes. Let's see...

* Notebooks cost $1.50 each, and he wants five, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
* Pens are $0.25 each, and he wants two, so that's 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
* The calculator is $12.
* The geometry set is $10.

Adding those up, it's $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! So we take 10% of $30, which is $3.

Finally, we subtract the discount: $30 - $3 = $27.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The hamburgers cost 5 * $4 = $20.
* The fries cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.
* The drinks cost 5 * $2 = $10.

"Okay, so Ray swims a mile in cold water in 16 minutes.  In warm water, it takes him twice that time plus 2 minutes, so that's (16 * 2) + 2 = 34 minutes per mile.

For 3 miles in cold water, it would take him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it would take 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer in warm water.

"
"Okay, so John makes $10 each day and works 4 days a week, so that's $40 a week.  To save $80, it will take him 2 weeks. 


2 

"
"Okay, so the fish sub costs $40. The cold-cut combo is three times that price, so it's $40 * 3 = $120.  

To find the total cost, we add the price of both subs: $40 + $120 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so there are 14 buttons with four holes each, which is 14 * 4 = 56 holes.  Then there are 7 buttons with two holes each, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 holes.  In total, there are 56 + 14 = 70 holes.

70 

"
"Okay, so Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's 24 cubic inch locker, which means it's 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.  Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.

"
"Let's break this down. We don't know exactly how much coffee someone *should* drink a day, but we know Octavia drinks half of that. Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks.  If Juan needs to cut back to 4 cups, we need to figure out how much more than 4 cups he's drinking now. 

Since we don't know the daily recommendation, we can just say it's 'x' cups.  

* Octavia drinks x/2 cups.
* Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

To find out how much he needs to cut back, we subtract: 5x - 4 



"
"Okay, so they have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.  Then they have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  In total, they have 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than him, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Then we divide by 3 because there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Okay, so the sun starts at 32 degrees above the ground because of the pyramid's angle. Then it goes up another 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours.  That's 50 degrees more (5 x 10 = 50).

So, the sun will be 82 degrees above the ground (32 + 50 = 82).


82 

"
"Okay, so James needs candles for his sons who are 12 and 8 years old. That's a total of 20 candles (12 + 8).  Since each pack has 5 candles, he'll need 4 packs (20 / 5).  If each pack costs $3, then he'll spend $12 in total (4 * $3).


$12 

"
"Okay, so Judy read for 15 minutes a night for a week, that's 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages.

In total, she read 70 + 100 = 170 pages.


170 

"
"Okay, so Cody and Trevor started with 12 sandwiches. Cody ate 1/3 of them, which is 4 sandwiches (12 / 3 = 4). Trevor ate 1/4, which is 3 sandwiches (12 / 4 = 3).  

Together they ate 7 sandwiches (4 + 3 = 7). That means there are 5 sandwiches left (12 - 7 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now and in 7 years he'll be 51.  The problem says in 7 years he'll be three times as old as his nephew.  So, if we let the nephew's age now be ""x"", in 7 years the nephew will be x + 7.  

We know 51 is three times the nephew's age in 7 years, so:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Let's solve for x:

51 = 3x + 21
30 = 3x
x = 10

The nephew is 10 years old. 

10 

"
"Okay, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for her first tooth. Then she got $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 * $1 = $3.  For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy paid half of $1, which is $0.50 per tooth. So those two teeth were worth 2 * $0.50 = $1.

Adding it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals.  Mark scored 20 less than Richie, so he scored 60 goals. Anna scored 45 less than Richie, so she scored 35 goals.  To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.


175 

"
"Mitchell made $84 because he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each (21 * 4 = 84).  Liam only made $63, so Mitchell made $21 more than him (84 - 63 = 21).


$21 

"
"Okay, so Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week. That's $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.

He spends the first four days buying wooden figures at $5 each, so he buys 4 days * $5/figure = 20 bucks worth of wooden figures.

That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50 for the rest of the week.

Plastic figures cost $2 each, so he can buy $50 / $2/figure = 25 plastic figures.

He bought 20 / $5/figure = 4 wooden figures.

In total, he has 25 + 4 = 29 action figures. 


29
"
"Okay, so let's add up all the costs for Leah's kitten.

The spaying was $200, the shots were $20 each and she got 3 of those, so that's $60.  Then she broke 4 vases at $12 each, so that's another $48.

Adding it all up: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308


308 

"
"Okay, so Ford grows 40 roses a week, but the shops want 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

That means he's short 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he's short a total of 25 * 4 = 100 roses each month. 

100 

"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000. She takes out $100 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $100 * 12 = $1200 taken out each year.

Over two years, she takes out $1200 * 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and takes out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, so they spend $3 on bread for 10 sandwiches, which is $0.30 per sandwich.  They also spend $30 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, so that's another $3 per sandwich.  That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.

If they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00


$37.00 

"
"Okay, so Kate has a lot of crayons! Let's see... she has 3 boxes times 64 crayons per box, which is 192 crayons.  Since she uses 8 crayons per muffin, she can make 192 crayons divided by 8 crayons per muffin, which equals 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, she'll make 24 muffins times $1.50 per muffin, which is $36.00.


$36.00 

"
"Okay, so Michael's bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 times 12 which equals 216 square feet.

The carpet itself costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 times $12, which is $2592.

Then he needs padding, which is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 times $2, which is $432.

Taking out the old carpet will cost $4 per square foot, so that's 216 times $4, which is $864.

Finally, putting in the new carpet costs $34 per square foot, so that's 216 times $34, which is $7344.

To find the total cost, we add up all those numbers: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232.



$11232
"
"Okay, so Mack saw a total of 280 birds over the seven days. To find the average, you divide the total birds by the number of days: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day.


40 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

* Diane starts with 20.
* Half of 20 is 10.
* Adding those together gives us 30.
* 30 divided by 5 is 6.
* 20 minus 12 is 8.
* Finally, 6 times 8 equals 48.


48 

"
"Okay, so the boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 less than that, which is 2 cards.  To find the total, we just add the number of cards each of them has: 5 + 2 = 7 cards.


7 

"
"Okay, so the oven is running 18 degrees hotter than it should be.  That's like a 4% increase.  If she wants it to be 520, she needs to set it lower to account for that extra heat.  

So, 4% of 520 is about 20.8 degrees.  She should set it to 499.2 degrees.


499.2 

"
"Okay, so the first movie is an hour and a half, which is 90 minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that's 2 times 60 plus 5, which is 125 minutes.  

To find the total time, we just add those together: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.


215 

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, so we need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is.  That's $76,000 * 0.30 = $22,800.

Juan's house cost $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the total value, we add the price of both houses: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200


129200 

"
"Okay, so Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, which is 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That means she brought a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 + 20 = 44 dishes. Her friend brought a total of 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

Together they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.


120 

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair of contacts lasts him one day.  

If a box costs $100 but is 10% off, that's $10 off, making each box $90. He buys two boxes, so that's $90 x 2 = $180.

He gets 90 contacts per box times 2 boxes, so that's 180 pairs of contacts.

To find the cost per pair, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs: $180 / 180 pairs = $1.00 per pair.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 3 hours. That means John worked a total of 7 hours.

Since they both get paid $10 an hour, Jill made $30 and John made $70.  John made $40 more than Jill.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories an hour, and she runs for an hour, so that's another 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Okay, so the jar has 4500 jelly beans total.  Let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans.

* Red jelly beans are 1% less than blue, so there are 0.99x red ones.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01x green ones.

That means the total number of jelly beans is x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 4500

So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans (4500 / 3 = 1500).

* Red: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
* Green: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

There are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans (1515 - 1485 = 30).

"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he goes up by another 5, he'll be at 57 WPM.  To find the average, you add up all three speeds (47 + 52 + 57 = 156) and then divide by 3 (156 / 3 = 52).

52 

"
"Okay, so if Martin eats Cheerios he loses 1.25 pounds a week, and that's for 5 weeks, so he'd lose 1.25 times 5 which is 6.25 pounds.

If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week for 5 weeks, so that's 1.75 times 5 which is 8.75 pounds.

To find the difference, we subtract the weight he loses from the weight he gains: 8.75 minus 6.25 equals 2.5 pounds.


2.5 

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and each of them brings 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 friends.  

That's a total of 100 + 200 = 300 people from the emails.

Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people.

In total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats. 

318 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

The Dachshund weighs twice the Affenpinscher, so it weighs 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs a quarter of the Dachshund, meaning it weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon, so it weighs 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.


220 

"
"Okay, so the boots on Amazon cost $16 plus $4 shipping, which is $20 total. On eBay, they're $13 plus double the Amazon shipping, so that's $13 + ($4 * 2) = $21.  That means the boots are $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.


$1 

"
"Okay, so the beanstalk doubles in size each day.  It starts at 4 feet and needs to reach 20 feet.

* Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

It'll take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than the window. 

3 

"
"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day, and we know 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  That means he's getting 6 grams of protein each day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6).

Over a week, that's 42 grams of protein (6 * 7 = 42).


42 

"
"Let's break this down. If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means he's 5 years older now than he was then.  So, he's 10 years old now. In 3 years, he'll be 13.


13 

"
"Okay, so George needs two implants at $2000 each, so that's $4000 right there. Then he wants a fancy porcelain crown for one of them, which adds another $500.  That brings the total to $4500.  He already paid $600, so he still owes $3900. If he makes $15 an hour, he needs to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.


260 

"
"Okay, so we know that all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's call the smallest angle ""x"".  

The problem says one angle is twice the smallest, so that's 2*x*. The other angle is three times the smallest, which is 3*x*.

To find out what 'x' is, we add them all up and set it equal to 180:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

That means 6x = 180.  

If we divide both sides by 6, we get x = 30.

The biggest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.


90 

"
"Okay, so Colby has a bunch of coins. Let's see... 8 quarters are worth $2.00, 6 dimes are $0.60, 14 nickels are $0.70, and 15 pennies are $0.15.  

If we add all that up, he has $3.45. Since each gumball costs $0.05, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.


69 

"
"Okay, so we've got 5 dogs with 4 legs each, that's 5 * 4 = 20 legs. Then there are 2 cats, also with 4 legs each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 legs.  Finally, we have 10 birds, and they have 2 legs each, giving us 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Adding all those up, we get 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.


48 

"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.  He increases that by 50%, which is like adding half of 8, so that's 4 more pounds. That makes it 12 pounds. But then he goes down 2 pounds, so he ends up using 10 pounds.


10 

"
"Okay, so Steve starts with 5 games.  Then he gets 1 a month for a year, which is 12 more. Plus 5 for Christmas, that's 22 games total for the first year.

The second year he gets 2 a month, so that's 24 more. Plus the 5 from Christmas, he has 51 games.

The third year he gets 4 a month, so that's 48 more. Plus 5 for Christmas, he ends up with 104 games.


104 

"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, which means it's flying at 400 miles per hour (1200 / 3 = 400).  To go another 2000 miles at that speed, it would take 5 hours (2000 / 400 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours, which means he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour. Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in two hours, so she makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Together they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds per hour.  If they work for 12 hours, they'll make 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds of chocolate.


1260 

"
"Okay, so Howard spent $8 on Monday. Then on Tuesday, he spent double that, which is $8 * 2 = $16. On Wednesday, he spent four times what he did on Tuesday, so that's $16 * 4 = $64.

In total, he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left. 


$12
"
"Okay, so Patrick sold lemonade for a total of 6 hours.  For the first 4 hours, he made 15 cups an hour times $0.50 a cup, which is $7.50 each hour. So that's $7.50 times 4 hours, which equals $30.00.

Then for the last 2 hours, he made 10 cups an hour times $0.60 a cup, which is $6.00 each hour.  That's $6.00 times 2 hours, which is $12.00.

Finally, we add his earnings from both parts: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00


$42.00
"
"Okay, so Jeremy's car tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles.  If he drives 400 miles a month, that's 400 / 2 = 200 sets of 2 miles.

So his tires rotate 200 * 725 = 145,000 times each month.

If a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced, it will last 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

That's 72 / 12 = 6 years.


6 

"
"Okay, so the big shampoo bottle costs $24 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump, the bottle will last twice as long, meaning she gets 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

That means each wash costs $24 / 240 washes = $0.10.  Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents. 


40 

"
"Okay, so Joe has $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35.  There's a 30% off sale, so let's figure out the discount on each item:

* Shirt discount: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50
* Shorts discount: $35 * 0.30 = $10.50

Now, let's find the sale prices:

* Sale price of shirt: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50
* Sale price of shorts: $35 - $10.50 = $24.50

Adding those up, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00

Finally, Joe will have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left.


$8.00
"
"Okay, so Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.  He's making 4 dozen a day, so that's 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter each day.

Over a week, he'll need 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter. 

7 

"
"Okay, so repaving Monica's street costs $194 per meter times 150 meters, which is $29,100.  Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it would cost $194 per meter times 490 meters, which is $95,060.  To find the difference, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.


$65960 

"
"Okay, so John got $100,000 for each of the first 5 months, which is $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.

His research took 10 times longer, so that's 5 months * 10 = 50 months total.

That means the extra months were 50 months - 5 months = 45 months.

Each of those extra months cost 50% more, so that's $100,000 * 0.50 = $50,000 extra per month.

So, each of those extra months cost $100,000 + $50,000 = $150,000.

The total cost of those extra months is 45 months * $150,000/month = $6,750,000.

Adding that to the first 5 months, the total cost is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.



$7,250,000
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The first player ate 6 ounces of steak.
* The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
* The third player had a pound of steak, which is 16 ounces.

Adding those up: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat.


30 

"
"Okay, so there are 1000 people in the group and they each post 3 times a day. That means there are 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts every day.

March has 31 days, so in total there would be 3000 * 31 = 93000 posts.


93000 

"
"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week, which is 2 loads * 52 weeks = 104 loads a year.

Each load uses 20 gallons, so that's 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons a year.

Water costs $0.15 per gallon, so he spends 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312 a year on laundry water.


$312 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Scarlett spent.

* The aquarium cost $10.00.
* The rocks were $2.50 each, and she bought two, so that's $2.50 * 2 = $5.00.
* The coral was $2.00 each, and she got three, so that's $2.00 * 3 = $6.00.
* The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $0.50 * 20 = $10.00.
* The fish food was $2.00.

Adding it all up: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00


$33.00
"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 3 inches. Then it doubles in the second week, so it's 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.  Finally, it grows another 4 inches, bringing the total height to 6 + 4 = 10 inches.

"
"Okay, so Prince sells 150 kg of meat each day.  The bull weighs 750 kg, so it will take him 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days to sell it all.

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, that's 4 * 18 = 72 seats total.

The administrators took up 1/4 of the seats, which is 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

The parents took up 1/3 of the remaining seats, which is 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

So, there were 54 - 18 = 36 seats left for the students.


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so each intersection has 6 poles with 4 lights each, that's 6 * 4 = 24 lights per intersection.  Since there are 4 intersections, there are 24 * 4 = 96 lights total. But 20 aren't working, so there are 96 - 20 = 76 working lights.

"Okay, so each DVD can be played 1000 times.  One DVD has been played a bunch already (356 times), so it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times. The other one has only been played 135 times, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

To find the total, we add those together: 644 + 865 = 1509 times.


1509 

"
"Okay, so John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. Each session was 2 hours long, so that's 2 sessions * 2 hours/session = 4 hours of therapy per week.

Over 6 weeks, he had 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours of physical therapy.

If each hour costs $125, then the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.


$3000 

"
"Okay, so Jim chews gum at school for 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces.

Then he chews 1 more on the way home and 1 after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces.

That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

He gives half to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"
"Okay, so Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years, which means she's 16 - 12 = 4 years old right now.  In 4 more years, she'll be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.


8 

"
"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 * $3 = $27 on baseballs. The basketball coach spent 8 * $14 = $112 on basketballs.  That means the basketball coach spent $112 - $27 = $85 more than the baseball coach.


$85 

"
"Okay, so Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 in each row, that's 10 * 20 = 200 flowers total.  Since only 4 out of every 5 have bloomed, we do 200 * (4/5) = 160 flowers.


160 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second.  To figure out how fast that is in Mb per hour, we gotta do a few conversions.

First, there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb, so her speed is 20 / 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Then, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Finally, multiply her speed per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.


72 

"
"Okay, so the tow truck towed 10 cars a day for the first three days, which is 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Then for the rest of the week, it towed 4 fewer cars each day, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 cars a day.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

So for those 4 days, it towed 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

In total, it towed 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.


54
"
"Okay, so Adam needs to grow 4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet more.  

Since he grows 2 inches a year, and there are 12 inches in a foot, that means he needs to grow 0.67 feet * 12 inches/foot = 8 inches.

It will take him 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years to grow tall enough.


4 

"
"Okay, so James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so that's 10 * $25,000 = $250,000 total.

The company paid 30% of that to get the cars, so they spent $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

That means they made a profit of $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets 10% of that profit, which is $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.


$17,500
"
"Okay, so 25% of the 100 surfers can stay up on the wave, which is 25 surfers.  Then 60% of those 25 are women, so that's 15 women. That means 10 surfers who stayed up are men.


10 

"
"Okay, so the gold jewelry costs 4/5 of what the diamond jewelry costs, which is $2000.  That means the gold jewelry is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver jewelry is $400 cheaper than the gold jewelry, so it costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total price, we add up the cost of all three: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.


$4800 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add up all the stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.


45 

"
"Okay, so Tom needs to close a 75-mile gap.  He's driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.  That means he'll gain 15 miles on Bob every hour.

To catch up 75 miles, it will take him 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"
"Okay, so Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than that, which is 11 fish.  Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so he caught 14 fish. 


14
"
"Okay, so Manny's parents will only pay for classes if they cost $10 or less each.  Since the whole thing costs $60, they have $40 extra they're willing to spend. That means he can miss 4 classes before it goes over $10 per class.


4 

"
"Okay, so Jewel does 50 customers a day, and Julie does double that, which is 100.  Together they do 150 customers each day.  If they work all week, that's 150 times 7, which equals 1050 customers.


1050 

"
"Okay, so Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times that amount, which is 20 miles.  Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.  That means Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.


17 

"
"Okay, so apples are $1.30 each and oranges are $1.10 each.  Five apples would cost $6.50 (5 x $1.30) and five oranges would cost $5.50 (5 x $1.10).  That means Clyde would pay $12.00 in total.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs to dig a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That means it'll hold 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet of dirt.

If he takes 3 seconds to dig out each cubic foot, it'll take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the whole hole.


216 

"
"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  The king cab is an extra $7,500.  The leather seats are $7,500 divided by 3, which is $2,500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they're $2,000. The light package is $1,500.

So, all the extras cost $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.

Adding that to the base price, the truck costs $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.


$43500 

"
"Okay, so Tim's getting a sweet deal!  

First, his raise is 5% of his old salary, so that's $20000 * 0.05 = $1000 extra each month.

Now his salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000 a month.

His bonus is half his old salary, which is $20000 / 2 = $10000.

So, each month he makes $21000 + $10000 = $31000.

In a year, that's $31000 * 12 = $372000.


$372000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The pants cost $750 divided by 5, which is $150 each.
* The suits cost 10 times $750, so that's $7500.
* The pants cost 10 times $150, which is $1500.
* He bought 10 suits times 3 shirts each, so that's 30 shirts.
* The shirts cost 30 times $60, which is $1800.
* To find the total, we add up the cost of everything: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800


$10800
"
"Okay, so they publish 30 articles a day together.  Since February has 28 days, they'd publish 30 times 28, which is 840 articles.

"
"Okay, so Steve is 60, and his wife is 4 years older, making her 64. Their son is half his mom's age, so he's 32.  His wife is 3 years younger than him, so she's 29.


29 

"
"Okay, so each bag has 8 portions and each portion is 2 kilograms. That means one bag has 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms of flour.  If we have three bags, that's 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms total.


48 

"
"Okay, so Alisa biked for 4.5 hours at 12 miles per hour, so she biked 4.5 * 12 = 54 miles. Stanley biked for 2.5 hours at 10 miles per hour, so he biked 2.5 * 10 = 25 miles.  

Together they biked 54 + 25 = 79 miles.


79 

"
"Okay, so Bill digs through soil pretty fast, 4 feet every hour.  But clay is tougher, so he only digs half as fast, which is 2 feet per hour.

He's got 24 feet of soil, so that'll take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours.

Then he's got 8 feet of clay, which will take 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

In total, it'll take him 6 + 4 = 10 hours to dig the whole well.


10 

"
"Okay, so Howie needs to get 2 cupcakes for each person.  There's him, his teacher, and 25 classmates, so that's 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people.

He needs 27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes.


54 

"
"Okay, so Fishio started with 2000 likes. After three weeks, that number went up 70 times, which is 2000 * 70 = 140,000 likes. Then she got 20,000 more new likes, so now she has 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes.


160000 

"
"Okay, so Clara got a good deal on Tuesday!  She saved $2 with her voucher, so she paid $398 for the pomegranates.

The next day, the price went way up to $30 each.  Even with the 10% discount, Sheila ended up paying $540.

That means Sheila paid $142 more than Clara did.


Answer: 142 

"
"Okay, so Ariadne made $400 from red hats, and that was half of what she made from green hats.  That means she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

So in the first month, she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of that, which is $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over both months, she made $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, so James gets a free hour, which means he pays for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, and each hour after that is double, so the next two hours are $30 each.  That means he paid $15 + $30 + $30 = $75.


75 

"
"Okay, so Sally started with $200 and now has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 this week.  But she should have gotten $300.  So they took out $300 - $220 = $80 from her paycheck.


$80 

"
"Okay, so Lori needs enough deviled eggs for 16 guests, and each guest wants 3 halves. That's 16 * 3 = 48 deviled egg halves.

Since each whole egg makes 2 halves, she'll need 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she needs 24 / 12 = 2 dozen eggs. 

2 

"
"Okay, so Shiela needs to write a 15-page paper and she's already done a third of it.  That means she's written 5 pages (15 / 3 = 5).  

She has 10 pages left to write (15 - 5 = 10).


10 

"
"Okay, so Mike needs to read 200 pages in 30 days, and he wants to read 10 pages each day.  That means it will take him 20 days to finish the book (200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days).

If he finishes in 20 days, he'll be done 10 days before the deadline (30 days - 20 days = 10 days).


10 

"
"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000 to buy.  Then he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that on fuel, so that's $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.

That means he spends $5000 + $10000 = $15,000 every month to keep the plane.

Over a whole year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

So in total, it cost him $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000 for the first year.


$330000 

"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so pork took 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together. That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total for rice and pork. Half of 80 is 40, so beans took 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each food: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much more the first mix costs compared to the second.

* **Mix 1:** Half a pound of almonds is $5 (since almonds are $10 a pound), and a third of a pound of walnuts is also $5. So that mix costs $10 total.

* **Mix 2:** A fifth of a pound of almonds is $2, and a third of a pound of walnuts is still $5. That mix costs $7.

* **The difference:**  Mix 1 costs $3 more than Mix 2 ($10 - $7 = $3).

"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese, and we need to figure out how many sheep he has.

We know:

* Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2.
* All the animals together have 70 legs.
* There are 20 heads in total.

This means we have 20 sheep and geese combined.  

Let's think about it: if all 20 animals were sheep, they'd have 80 legs (20 x 4 = 80). Since they only have 70 legs, some of them must be geese.

We need to figure out how many sheep and how many geese make 70 legs and 20 heads.  

Hmm, let me try a few things...

Aha! If there are 15 sheep, that's 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60). That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10), which means there are 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

Let's check: 15 sheep + 5 geese = 20 animals. That works!



15 

"
"Okay, so the coffee he normally buys is $5 a pound.  But since his usual brand is out, he has to buy a more expensive one that's 20% more. That means the new coffee is $5 + ($5 * 0.20) = $6 a pound.

He needs a pound a day for a week, which is 7 pounds total. So the coffee will cost him 7 * $6 = $42.

And don't forget the donut! That's another $2.

In total, everything costs $42 + $2 = $44. 


$44
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Gus spent $20 total.  He bought chips for $4 (2 bags x $2 each), chicken for $8, and soda for $1.  That's $13 altogether.

So, the apple pie must have cost $7 ($20 - $13 = $7).


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so James delivers 600 papers total.  He does 198 for District A and 209 for District C.  To find out how many he delivers to District B, you just subtract those from the total: 600 - 198 - 209 = 193.


193 

"
"Okay, so he has class 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours a week.

Over 6 weeks, that's 8 * 6 = 48 hours total.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so he learns 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes.


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers in total, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means there are 150 * 0.60 = 90 history teachers.

The rest must be math teachers, so there are 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so all the math teachers together sleep for 60 * 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $150.

If they put all their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  

If they split that evenly, each person would get $360 / 3 = $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so the game is normally 4 quarters of 12 minutes each, which is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.  But they played an extra 5 minutes because of the tie. So the whole game was 48 + 5 = 53 minutes long.

53 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the 50 employees are managers, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 managers.  

Out of those managers, 30% oversee the whole company, so that's 10 * 0.30 = 3 employees.

"
"Okay, so Svetlana needs 8.25 tablespoons of stuff for each muffin.  If she's making 16 muffins, she'll need 8.25 times 16 tablespoons, which is 132 tablespoons.

"
"Okay, so they have a total of 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.  If they split it evenly, each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.


4 

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies of type A at $0.50 each, which is 7 * $0.50 = $3.50. He also got 10 candies of type B at $0.75 each, so that's 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.  

In total, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

If he paid with $15.00, his change is $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days total. She already had 8 good days, then 1 more good day, and then another good day. That's 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days.

So she has 12 - 10 = 2 good days left. 

2 

"
"Let 'x' be the number of books Sally has. Janey has twice that amount plus 3 more, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

Subtract 3 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Sally has 9 books. 
9
"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches per day.  It needs to grow 600 inches total and is already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  That means it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240 = 360).

If it grows 30 inches a day, it will take 12 days to grow 360 inches (360 / 30 = 12).


12 

"
"Okay, so James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then 8 more dogs show up, so he needs 8 more toys. That's 12 toys total.

But wait, when he comes back there are twice as many dogs! That's 8 dogs * 2 = 16 more dogs. So now he needs 16 more toys, bringing his total to 12 + 16 = 28 toys.

Finally, 3 dogs get adopted, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.  That leaves him needing 28 - 3 = 25 toys.


25 

"
"Okay, so Dylan put in 2/5 of the $1200, which is $480. That leaves $720 left. Frances put in 2/3 of that, so she put in $480 too.  That means Skyler put in the rest, which is $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so they have 64 signatures already. They want to get to 100.  That means they need 36 more.


36 

"
"Karen makes double what Lorie makes, so she earns $10 * 2 = $20 per hour. If she works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 * 3 = $60 each day. Over two days, she'd earn $60 * 2 = $120.


120 

"
"Okay, so if 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 / 6 = 6).  If you have 96 potatoes, you can make a ton of hash browns!  You'd get 576 hash browns (96 x 6 = 576).


576 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 adults plus Jack, that's 9 people in total.  If each adult weighs 80 kg, then they weigh 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.  The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they're going over by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Katarina has 68 cookies and that's 5 less than Max, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
* Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, meaning the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
* Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.


298 

"
"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer by 50%, which means it's now 150% of its original size.  Then she added 20cm of lace.  If the final dress is 140cm, we need to figure out what 150% of the original length is, and then subtract the lace.

Let's say the original dress was 'x' centimeters long.

* 150% of the original length is 1.5x
* We know 1.5x + 20 = 140
* Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120
* Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80


**Answer: 80** 

"
"Okay, so Chris mows his whole lawn in an hour on turtle mode, which is 60 minutes.  

Half the lawn would take 30 minutes.

He mows the other half in rabbit mode, which takes 40 minutes total, so half of that is 20 minutes.

If you add those times together, it took him 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Okay, so they've already walked for 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.  That means they have 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes left to get to school.


11 

"
"Okay, let's break down the cost:

* The apples cost $4.
* The bananas cost $2 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 * 2 = $4.
* The oranges cost $3 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $3 * 2 = $6.

Adding it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14


14
"
"Okay, so Celinda bakes double the amount Greta does, which is 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  That means they baked a total of 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After eating some, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.


80 

"
"Okay, so we have twins and triplets, and we need to figure out how old one of the twins is.  

We know:

* One twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.
* All their ages added up equal 44.

Let's think of it like this:

*  Let's say the triplets are all 'r' years old.
* One twin is 'r + 7' years old.
* The other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, if we add up all their ages: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That simplifies to 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, the triplets are 6 years old.

One of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.



13
"
"Okay, so John has 3 hours until dinner, which is 180 minutes.  He needs 20 minutes for math, 40 for reading, and 20 for history, for a total of 80 minutes of homework.  That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left for a nap.


100 

"
"Okay, so Manolo buys 5 lollipops at $0.40 each, which is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

That means the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Since he bought 4 candies, each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, 10 lollipops would cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00, and 10 candies would cost 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

In total, that's $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.


$7.00
"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins a month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that.  That means Neil saves 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins than Rong, so he saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins a month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.


5760
"
"Okay, so the vaccines cost $20 each, and he needs two, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet.  Let's say the total bill is ""x"".  We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

The total bill is the vaccines plus the heartworm check, so x = $40 + the cost of the heartworm check.

We can substitute to find the heartworm check cost: 0.60x = 0.60($40 + the cost of the heartworm check).

That means 0.60x = $24 + 0.60(the cost of the heartworm check).

To solve for the heartworm check, we can subtract 0.60(the cost of the heartworm check) from both sides: 0.40x = $24

Then divide both sides by 0.40 to find x, the total bill: x = $60

So the total bill is $60, and he brought $125, so he leaves with $125 - $60 = $65.



$65 

"
"Okay, so they have 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges in a crate.

* Apples cost $0.50 each, so 12 apples cost 12 * $0.50 = $6.00
* Bananas cost twice as much as apples, so they're $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each. 5 bananas cost 5 * $1.00 = $5.00
* Oranges are three times the price of bananas, so they're $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each. 7 oranges cost 7 * $3.00 = $21.00

Adding it all up, the crate costs $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


$32.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* She has 18 blue squares because she has 4 more than the 14 red ones.
* She has 24 green squares because she has 6 more than the 18 blue ones.
* She has 12 white squares because she has 12 less than the 24 green ones.

That means she has a total of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet. 

68 

"
"Okay, so Mia needs enough chairs for all the adults and babies.  That's 42 + 15 = 57 people.

She already has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, which is 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.

That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so half of the deer are bucks, which is 50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks.  Then 20% of those bucks have 8 points, so that's 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks.


5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Betty got 30% more points than Adam's 50, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.
* Tom has 30 less points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta collected 3 times Tom's amount, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they're still missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.


145 

"
"Okay, so Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids, and each of them had 3 kids. That means she has 3 * 3 = 9 grandkids.  Then each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so she has 9 * 3 = 27 great-grandbabies.


27 

"
"Okay, so Greta makes $2400. She saves half of that for retirement, which is $1200. Then she spends $480 on her car payment (20% of her paycheck).  

If we add those together, she's spent $1200 + $480 = $1680.

That means she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left over.


$720.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 spots for pencils, but 4 are missing. That means there are 16 pencils left in the box.  Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2: 16 pencils / 2 pencils/pair = 8 pairs.


8 

"
"Okay, so the city is setting off a ton of fireworks!  They have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each, so that's 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of those, which is 300 * 0.40 = 120 fireworks.

She's also setting off her own fireworks, 3 boxes with 5 in each, for a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Adding those together, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks.


135 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 people in total going to the movies.  Each person gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

That means they bought 40 + 60 = 100 drinks and snacks altogether.

Since each drink or snack costs $2, they spent 100 * $2 = $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's 4000 pound truck, so Gordy can haul 4800 pounds.

Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.

That means Gary's truck must be able to haul 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


2800
"
"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls. The girls each ate 3 dumplings, and the guys ate 1 more than that, so they ate 4 dumplings each.

That means the guys ate a total of 8 guys * 4 dumplings/guy = 32 dumplings.

The girls ate a total of 6 girls * 3 dumplings/girl = 18 dumplings.

Adding those together, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.


50 

"
"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100, and Gerald got 3 out of 5 shares. That means he got (3/5) * $100 = $60.  After buying the book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.


$50
"
"Okay, so the cat is super fast at 15 feet per second. The turtle is way slower, like 5 times slower.  That means the turtle crawls at 15 feet per second / 5 = 3 feet per second.

If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it'll cover 3 feet per second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they need to raise $4200 more.  If they raise $700 each hour, it'll take them 6 hours to get to their goal.


6 

"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses 40% of the river water.  And they use 80% of *that* for factories and stuff.  That means the other 20% of the water they use is for everything else.  So, 20% of 40%... that's like 8% of the whole river's water.


8 

"
"Okay, so Alex makes $12 each day tutoring.  There are 7 days in a week, so she makes $12 * 7 = $84 per week. For two weeks, she'd make $84 * 2 = $168.


168 

"
"Okay, so they make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, which means they make 50 quarts each hour.  They make vanilla slower, 50 quarts in 4 hours, so that's 12.5 quarts per hour.  Together, they make 62.5 quarts every hour.  

If they work for 48 hours straight, they'd make 62.5 times 48 quarts, which is 3000 quarts.


3000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The croissants cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
* The cinnamon rolls cost 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
* The quiches cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
* The muffins cost 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

So, before the discount, his total is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

His discount is $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

That means his final bill is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00 


$45.00
"
"Okay, so Erin gets a free scoop for every two she buys. That means she's basically paying for 2 scoops at a time.  Since each scoop costs $1.50, two scoops would cost $3.00.  She has $6.00, so she could buy two sets of scoops, which is 4 scoops total. But wait, remember the deal! For every two she buys, she gets one free. So, she'd get an extra two scoops free.

That means she should buy 6 scoops. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day for two weeks, which is 14 days. That's 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. Amy eats 3 pieces a day for two weeks, so that's 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left. Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger. 


14
"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden wants to tile two-thirds of his bathroom. That's 2/3 * 36 square feet, which is 24 square feet.  Since he needs 24 tiles per square foot, he'll need 24 * 24 = 576 tiles.


576 

"
"Okay, so James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. He got 30 pounds, so that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

In total, he spent $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 * $2.50 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own.


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each, but the price went up by 10%.  

First, figure out how much the price increased: $700 * 0.10 = $70.

Then add that to the original price: $700 + $70 = $770.

Finally, multiply that new price by the number of computers: $770 * 500 = $385,000.

So they ended up paying $385,000.


$385,000
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* The eggs have 6 * 75 = 450 calories.
* The cheese has 2 * 120 = 240 calories.
* The ham also has 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

Adding those up, the omelet has 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.


770 

"
"Okay, so pencils are $0.50 each, and erasers are $0.25 each.  You bought 6 pencils, so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00. You also got 8 erasers, which is 8 * $0.25 = $2.00.  

In total, you spent $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00. Since you paid with a $10 bill, your change is $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the 100 people get interviews, which is 30 people. Then 20% of those 30 get job offers, so that's 6 people.  Finally, only a third of those 6 people take the job, which is 2 people.


2 

"
"Okay, so Goldy gave away 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks of rice.

Since each sack has 25 kilograms, she gave away a total of 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms of rice.


175 

"
"Okay, so Castle bought 8 boxes this week (3 + 5 = 8) and 4 boxes last week.  That means she bought 4 more boxes this week.


4 

"
"Okay, so Helga's a fast dancer! Let's break it down:

* When her arms are down, she taps 300 + 250 = 550 times per minute.
* That's 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps with her arms down.
* With her arms up, she taps 200 taps/minute per foot, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 taps per minute.
* Over 2 minutes, that's 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

In total, she taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times.


2450
"
"Okay, so Ron's car could get messed up for $450.  If he fixes it himself, he has to pay $120 for being a rebel and $75 for the asphalt stuff.

So, fixing it himself costs $195. That means he saves $450 - $195 = $255 by doing it himself.


$255 

"
"Okay, so they started with 170 regular chairs and 23 baby chairs, that's a total of 193 chairs.  Then they took away 20 regular chairs and 13 baby chairs, so they took away 33 chairs in total.  

That means they have 193 - 33 = 160 chairs left.


160 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 pizzas total, and each has 12 slices, that's 60 slices altogether. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so they ate (2/3) * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices. The other two friends ate (3/4) * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.  

In total, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices. That means there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left.


18 

"
"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog is faster, taking only 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  

To find the average, we add their times together (30 + 20 = 50 minutes) and then divide by 2 because there are two animals. 

That means the average time they take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. 

25 

"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's 96 inches plus 4 inches, so it's 100 inches long.

The problem says his shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So if we let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe, we can set up an equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.


10 

"
"Okay, so Hannah smashes a quarter of the student cars, which is 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars.  Since each student car has 4 windows, that's 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

She smashes 3/4 of the teacher cars, which is 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars.  Each teacher car has 2 windows, so that's 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

In total, she smashes 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.


112 

"
"Okay, so Candy has 60 blue spools (15 light blue + 45 dark blue) out of a total of 150 spools.  To find the percentage, you do (60 / 150) * 100% which equals 40%.


40 

"
"Okay, so 2/5 of the people voted by midday, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

That means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left.

Then, 2/3 of those remaining people voted by 4 pm, so that's (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people.

So, 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people hadn't voted by 4 pm.


1000 

"
"Okay, so Parker needs gum for 30 days and chews 4 pieces a day. That's 30 * 4 = 120 pieces of gum.

Each pack has 15 pieces, so he'll need 120 / 15 = 8 packs.


8 

"
"Okay, so they need enough graham crackers for 24 smores total.  Each box makes enough for 24 smores (3 sleeves x 8 smores/sleeve), so they'll only need 1 box.


1 

"
"Okay, so Dora is 15. Her dad is twice her age plus 8 years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is 4 years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find their total combined age, we add up their ages: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.


87 

"
"If Greg splits $20 equally with his 3 siblings, that means there are 4 people sharing the money (Greg + 3 siblings = 4).  So, each person gets $20 / 4 = $5.


$5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Her math and science books together weigh 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds.
* Her history book is double her English book, so it weighs 3 pounds * 2 = 6 pounds.
*  Adding up all the books: 4 pounds + 4 pounds + 3 pounds + 6 pounds = 17 pounds


17 

"
"Okay, so Candidate A got 20% of the votes, and Candidate B got 50% more than that.  That means Candidate B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.

Together, Candidates A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.

That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for Candidate C.

Since there were 100 voters, Candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Beck starts with 100 - 23 = 77 apples.  Then Boris gives him 10, so Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples left.  That means Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 more apples than Beck.


3 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

He uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes. That's a total of 30 ounces.

Since he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left over. 


2
"
"Okay, so Clara has 20 books and that's twice the number Steven has.  That means Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.


4 

"
"Okay, so a gallon of milk costs $5, and a half-gallon costs $3.  

* 10 gallons would cost 10 * $5 = $50
* 16 half-gallons would cost 16 * $3 = $48

In total, she spent $50 + $48 = $98.


98 

"
"Okay, so 10 students like baking, 5 like basketball, and 10 like music (because that's double the number who like basketball).  That's 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 students.

If there are 50 students total, then 50 - 25 = 25 students must like playing video games.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy starts with 12 birds. He scares away a third of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 birds. That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 birds. Then 20 more show up, so there are 8 + 20 = 28 birds in total.


28 

"
"Okay, so there are 80 students total split evenly between two classes, meaning each class has 40 students.  If 40% are girls, then there are 40 * 0.40 = 16 girls in each class. That means there must be 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.


24 

"
"Okay, so Mara starts with 2 slices and adds 3 more, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Then she triples that amount, which is 5 * 3 = 15 slices.  She eats 2, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Finally, her friend takes 5, so there are 13 - 5 = 8 slices left.


8 

"
"Okay, so Melissa has to groom a bunch of animals this week. Let's see... she's got 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. That's a total of 28 animals.

Since there are 7 days in a week, she'll groom 28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals each day.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mark spent $5400 on the packs.  He made $4000 from one card and $1000 from another, so that's $5000 right there. Then he got 30 more cards worth $50 each, so those are worth $1500.  That means all his cards are worth $6500.

If he made $6500 and spent $5400, his profit is $1100.


$1100
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The first park costs $26 per adult and $12 per child. With 2 adults and 2 kids, that's (2 * $26) + (2 * $12) = $52 + $24 = $76.

The second park is $14 per adult and $10 per child. So, for their family, it would be (2 * $14) + (2 * $10) = $28 + $20 = $48.

They'd save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.


$28
"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 per tomato.  Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, that's a savings of $50 each day.  Over a week, he saves $50/day * 7 days = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice that amount, which is 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the number Sean has, so he has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  

To find the total for Carl and Cal, we add their marbles together: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.


336 

"
"Okay, so they need to make 12 groups, but they only have enough students for 6.  That means they need 6 more groups.


6 

"
"Okay, so Candy rents out 60 chairs each weekday and 100 each weekend day. That's 300 chairs during the week (60 x 5) and 200 on the weekend (100 x 2), for a total of 500 chairs per week.

In a month with 4 weeks, she rents out 2000 chairs (500 x 4).  

Over two months, she'd rent out 4000 chairs (2000 x 2).


4000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
* Arnold takes half, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
* That leaves Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.
* He adds 25 more, so he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
* Then Arnold takes 12 more, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.
* Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, for a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.


So Gunther has 43 bananas. 

"
"Okay, so the bill is $100 each month, and there are 4 roommates splitting it. That means each roommate pays $100 / 4 = $25 per month.

To find out how much they pay each year, we multiply that by 12 months: $25/month * 12 months = $300 per year.


$300 

"
"Okay, so Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, or 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, so that's 4 times 12, or 48 plates.  

Then, some stuff broke - 10 glasses and 6 plates.  So, he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left and 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

That means he has a total of 86 + 42 = 128 glasses and plates now. 


128 

"
"Okay, so Lorraine starts with a bunch of stickers and wants to trade them for buttons.  

* She trades most of her small stickers for large buttons, which is a good deal since each large button is worth three small ones.
* Then she trades half her big stickers for more large buttons.
* The rest of her big stickers she trades back for small buttons.

Let me see... she ends up with a lot of buttons!  

**Answer:** 107 

"
"Okay, so Joey played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and then double the Monday amount on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 games.  

That means he played a total of 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 games.


7 

"
"Okay, so there were twice as many ""yes"" votes as ""no"" votes.  If you add them together, you get all 33 council members.  

That means the ""no"" votes and the ""yes"" votes make up 3 parts (1 part ""no"" + 2 parts ""yes"" = 3 parts total).

So, each ""part"" is 33 votes / 3 parts = 11 votes.

Since the ""yes"" votes are 2 parts, there were 2 parts * 11 votes/part = 22 votes in favor.


22 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

*  If 11 kids need extra-small shirts, and twice that many need small, then 11 * 2 = 22 kids need small shirts.
* Four less than the number needing small need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 kids need medium.
* Half as many kids need large as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 kids need large shirts.
* Finally, 6 more kids need extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 kids need extra-large.

To find the total, we add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.


75 

"
"Okay, so the bag is 5% off, which means we need to figure out what 5% of $140 is.  

5% is the same as 0.05, so we multiply: 0.05 * $140 = $7.

That means the discount is $7.  

To find the final price, we subtract the discount from the original price: $140 - $7 = $133.


$133 

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of music!  

Let's see... 20 playlists times 300 songs per playlist is 6000 songs total. And since each song is 10 hours long, that's 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours of music!

60000 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the people like horse #2, which is 20/100 * 50 = 10 people.

That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Then 60% of those people like horse #7, so that's 60/100 * 40 = 24 people.

That means 40 - 24 = 16 people think horse #12 will win.


16 

"
"Okay, so one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, and we know there are 6 girl Pomeranians. That means there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.

Since the Pomeranians make up two-thirds of all the puppies, Jana has 18 * 3 / 2 = 27 puppies.


27 

"
"Okay, so Jayden needs $200 for the camera. He already has $70 and his sister gave him $45, so he has a total of $70 + $45 = $115.  That means he still needs $200 - $115 = $85.


$85 

"
"Okay, so they need 250 cases total. The second house needs the most, and the first house needs half of that.  The third house needs double the first house.

Let's say the second house needs 100 cases. That means the first house needs 50 cases (half of 100). The third house needs double the first house, so that's another 100 cases.

50 + 100 + 100 = 250, so that works!


100 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6
* Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5
* Chase spent 1 head of lettuce * $3/head = $3

Adding those up, they spent a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $14 on their salad.


14 

"
"Okay, so George has 45% more pears than bananas.  That means he has 200 bananas + (45/100)*200 bananas = 290 pears.

In total, he has 290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits.


490 

"
"Okay, so Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. That means she had $60 left for candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $5, she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars.


12 

"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 kg of oranges for every liter of juice.  If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 5 kg/liter * 4 liters = 20 kg of oranges.

Since each kg costs $3, the total cost would be 20 kg * $3/kg = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Ezra read 300 books and then read 150 more, for a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.  Ahmed read half as many as Ezra, so he read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Together they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.


600 

"
"Okay, so Tanya makes $15 an hour teaching.  

On Monday, she taught for 5 hours and got an extra $5 because she taught more than 3 classes. So that's $15 x 5 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she only taught for 2 hours, so she made $15 x 2 = $30.

In total, she made $80 + $30 = $110.


110 

"
"Okay, so they sold 5 of each vanilla scent, and they had 4 vanilla scents, so that's 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

They sold 2 of each fruity scent, and they had 8 fruity scents, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

They sold 20 - 16 = 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.


4 

"
"Okay, so Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.  That means he needs to make another $75 from the corn.  If he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each one for $3 to reach his goal. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, that's 12 hours total. She reads for 3 hours, leaving 9 hours.  She spends a third of that time on video games, which is 3 hours. That means she has 6 hours left for soccer.  

To find the percentage, you divide the soccer time by the total time and multiply by 100: (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100% = 50%

50 

"
"Okay, so Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives half to Brandon, which is 25 pencils. That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gives Charlie 3/5 of those, which is 15 pencils (3/5 * 25 = 15).  So Anthony keeps 10 pencils.


10 

"
"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, for a total of 300 miles.  Since he drives 75 mph, that means he spends 4 hours driving (300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours).  

He also spends 6 hours at the museum, so he's gone for a total of 10 hours (4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours).


10
"
"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.  Cars need 4 wheels each, and motorcycles need 2.

* Cars: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels
* Motorcycles: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels

That's a total of 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

He has 650 wheels, so he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.


276 

"
"Okay, so a 20% discount means you save 20/100 * $1000 = $200.  

So you'd pay $1000 - $200 = $800.


$800 

"
"Okay, so Mike has a lot of movies! Let's figure this out step-by-step.

First, he has 600 movies and a third of them are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.

Since he can get those series for a discount, they'll cost him 200 * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in a series.

Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.

Those older movies will cost him 160 * $5 = $800.

That means there are 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies left.

Those will cost him 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up, his total cost is $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.



$3866.67
"
"Okay, so Winston bought 6 pounds of peaches at $2 a pound, so that's 6 * 2 = $12.  Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1 a pound, which is 8 * 1 = $8.  And lastly, he picked up 6 pounds of apricots at $3 a pound, so that's 6 * 3 = $18.

To find the total, we add up the cost of each fruit: $12 + $8 + $18 = $38.00


38.00 

"
"Okay, so they drove for 4.5 hours and went 50 miles per hour, so they drove 4.5 * 50 = 225 miles.

Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, so they hiked 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

Adding those together, their vacation spot is 225 + 30 = 255 miles away. 

255 

"
"Okay, so Ava and Emma are trying to figure out who's better at this new game.  

Here's the deal:

* We don't know how many enemies Emma jumps on or berries she collects, so let's just call those ""x"" enemies and ""y"" berries.

* Ava does better in some ways: she jumps on 8 *more* enemies than Emma (so x + 8) and gets 3 *more* berries (y + 3).

* But, Ava takes 4 *more* seconds to finish the level, which means Emma has 4 extra seconds on the timer.

To figure out who wins, we need to know how many points each of them gets.

* **Emma's score:** 10 points per enemy (10x) + 5 points per berry (5y) + 30 points for each second left on the timer.

* **Ava's score:** 10 points per enemy (10 * (x + 8)) + 5 points per berry (5 * (y + 3)) + 30 points per second, but she has 4 *fewer* seconds.

To see who wins, we'd have to know the actual numbers for enemies, berries, and timer seconds. Then we could calculate each person's score and see who's higher! 



"
"Okay, so they spent $30 on two pizzas, which means the other two pizzas cost $64 - $30 = $34.  Since the other two pizzas cost the same, each one cost $34 / 2 = $17.


$17 

"
"Okay, so they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, which is 3 * 5 = 15 times.

Then on the other two days, they ride twice as much, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 rides each day.

Over those two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Adding it all up, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times in a week. 


27
"
"Okay, so Bob starts with 3 orange and 4 white fish. He buys 17 more, but we don't know how many are orange or white.  

Let's say he buys 'w' white fish. That means he bought (17 - w) orange fish.

After he buys the new fish, he has (3 + 17 - w) orange fish and (4 + w) white fish.

The problem says he has twice as many orange fish as white fish after the purchase. So:

3 + 17 - w = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4


He bought 4 white fish. 

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work each way, so that's 10 miles a day.  He works 5 days a week, so he drives 50 miles total. His car gets 10 miles to the gallon, so he uses 5 gallons of gas each week. If gas costs $3 a gallon, then he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 a week on gas.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Carrie got $200 from the twenties and $35 from the quarters.  She spent $120 of the twenties, so she spent a total of $120 + $35 = $155 on lunch.


$155 

"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes, that's 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.  He also has 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.  In total, he'll get 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.


142 

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs total.  A quarter of them were smart TVs, which is 40 / 4 = 10 TVs. Then 1/8 were analog, so that's 40 / 8 = 5 TVs.  That means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 TVs that weren't OLED.  So he sold 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs.


25 

"
"Okay, so the school is paying for half the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.  That means John still needs $300 - $150 = $150. Since he already has $50, he's still short $150 - $50 = $100.


$100 

"
"Okay, so it's 33 degrees colder at night, which means it's 12 degrees (45 - 33 = 12).  The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees, so it needs to be 20 degrees warmer (32 - 12 = 20). Each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, so Carson needs to burn 4 logs (20 / 5 = 4).


4 

"
"Okay, so they had 90 people and split them into groups of 9, so that's 10 groups total.  Then 3 out of every 5 groups brought back seashells, so that's 6 groups. Each person in those groups brought back 2 seashells, and there are 9 people in each group. So that's 6 groups * 9 people/group * 2 seashells/person = 108 seashells.


108 

"
"Okay, so there were 172 people on the train. Then 47 got off and 13 got on, so that's 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 people. Then 38 more got off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train.


100 

"
"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day, and each one is worth 25 cents. That means he makes $2.50 every day (10 x $0.25 = $2.50).

If there are 30 days in a month, he'd make $75.00 in a month ($2.50 x 30 = $75.00).


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours. That's $20 * 8 = $160.

She worked 3 extra hours, and she gets paid 1.5 times her normal rate for those. So that's $20 * 1.5 = $30 an hour for overtime.

For the overtime, she made $30 * 3 = $90.

Adding it all up, she made $160 + $90 = $250 that day.


$250
"
"Okay, so there are 12 female lions, and half that number of males, which is 6.  Then there are 14 cubs.  Adding those all up, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in total. 

32 

"
"Okay, so the jeans are 25% off, and they originally cost $40.  That means the discount is $40 * 0.25 = $10.  

So the jeans are on sale for $40 - $10 = $30.

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, he'll get $50 - $30 = $20 in change.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so they start with 200 people and add 20 more each month for three months. That's 20 * 3 = 60 new people.

So now they have 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

If each person makes $4000 a month, the company pays 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.


1040000 

"
"Okay, so they're singing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, and that song is 150 seconds long, so that's 150 * 2 = 300 seconds.  Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is 240 seconds.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy gets paid $11.50 an hour now. Sally makes $10.50.  If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $230 ($11.50 x 20) and Sally makes $210 ($10.50 x 20). That means Billy makes $20 more than Sally.


$20 

"
"Okay, so 3 loaves of bread would cost 3 * $2 = $6.  Two bagels would cost 2 * $1 = $2.  That means 3 loaves cost $6 - $2 = $4 more than 2 bagels.


$4 

"
"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139.  Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total, we add their scores: 278 + 150 = 428


428 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 kids each, that's 40 * 25 = 1000 students.  And there are 3 teachers per class, so that's 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Each student plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees. Each teacher plants two trees, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

In total, they plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.


1240 

"
"Okay, so Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals.

If she wants goats to be 30% of her collection, she needs to figure out 30% of 14.  That's 0.30 * 14 = 4.2.

Since you can't buy parts of a stuffed animal, she'll need to buy 5 goats. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Kris wants to play for 30 hours total.  

Let's see how much she plays in the first two weeks: 30 minutes a day is half an hour, so that's 0.5 hours a day. Over two weeks, that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week, so that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours to get the achievement.

"
"Okay, so the second car is going 10 miles per hour faster than the first car.  That means every hour it pulls ahead by 10 miles.  Over two hours, it'll be 20 miles ahead.


20 

"
"Okay, so the diamond and gold cost $900 in total.  A 30% premium on that is $270 (because 30% of 900 is 270).  So, the ring cost him $1170 in total.


$1170 

"
"Okay, so to find the overall pass rate, we need to figure out what percentage of all the students passed. 

*  Let's see, 340 out of 500 third graders passed, so that's 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.
* Then 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, which is 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
* The fifth graders had double the pass rate of the fourth graders, so they passed at 40% * 2 = 80%. That means 400 * 0.80 = 320 fifth graders passed.

* In total, 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passed.
*  Since there are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students in total, the overall pass rate is (700 / 1000) * 100% = 70%.


70 

"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic is going to be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. He has 2 bags of chips with 72 chips each, so he has a total of 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.  

To find out how long he can make his mosaic, we divide the total chips by the chips needed per inch: 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches.


4 

"
"Okay, so they had 10 quarts left over.  

The first group drank 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

The second group drank 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

That means they drank a total of 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

So, at the beginning, they must have had 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons.


12 

"
"Okay, so Dale started with 100 candies, sold 150, and then got 100 more. That means he has 200 candies total (100 + 100) and has already sold 150.  He needs to sell 50 more to get rid of all his candy. 


50
"
"Okay, so the number of students doubles each month.  

* At the start there are 10.
* After January, there are 10 * 2 = 20
* February: 20 * 2 = 40
* March: 40 * 2 = 80
* April: 80 * 2 = 160
* May: 160 * 2 = 320

That means there are 320 students at the end of May. Since there were 10 to start, there are 320 - 10 = 310 extra students.


310 

"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 and each branch costs him $0.25 to climb. To find out how many branches he climbed total, we divide the total money by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

If he worked 5 days, we divide the total branches by the number of days to find the average: 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.


84 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* She starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
* Then adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* Then adds 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* And finally 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals
* That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

But she drops one of each kind, so that's 5 petals lost.

* 101 petals - 5 petals = 96 petals


96 

"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows and used 18 to make their s'mores. They also lost 3, so that's 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores.


7 

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, so together that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* His better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 


$17.00
"
"Okay, so Tanya uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Let's say she uses 1 ounce of zest. That means she also uses 1 ounce of fragrance. Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, she uses 2 ounces of salt. That also means she uses 2 ounces of sugar.  

Because she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses 4 ounces of oil.

If we add all that up (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2), we get 10 ounces, which is the size of her jar.



**Answer:** 4 

"
"Okay, so John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500.  He also got 2 cows for $1500 each, which is 2 * $1500 = $3000.  

To find the total, we add those together: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.


$4500 

"
"Okay, so Paul needs 63 cupcakes total. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones, which is 48 cupcakes in all.  He needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 


15
"
"Okay, so Joe has double the cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of them, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.


16 

"
"Okay, so the charity got $175,000 total, and $50,000 of that was from other places. That means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.


$6,250
"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time the second day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.  That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 cars at first, then 20 more came, making a total of 70.  Half of those left, so 70 / 2 = 35 cars were left.


35 

"
"Okay, so John does 30 sets of work each day, and each set has 5 things he has to do.  Each of those things pays him $1.20.  

So, he makes $1.20 x 5 = $6.00 for each set of work.

If he does 30 sets a day, he makes $6.00 x 30 = $180.00 each day.

Over a whole week, that's $180.00 x 7 = $1260.00


$1260.00 

"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.  Adding up both games, Sasha scored a total of 14 + 4 = 18 points.


18
"
"Okay, so Kimberly bought a bunch of cat and dog food.  Let's see... she got 8 packs of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.  She got 6 packs of dog food with 6 tins each, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.  

To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 


52
"
"Okay, so let's break this down.

* PJ has some number of cards, let's call it ""x"".
* Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together they have 341 cards, so we can write an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.


153
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue eggs, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs. 

27 

"
"Okay, so Milly's book cost $32, but she's only getting 75% of that back, which is $24.  Shipping is $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $1.40. Then there's the mileage, which is $0.08 per mile and it's 20 miles away, so that's $1.60.  

Adding the shipping costs together, it's $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

So, she loses the $3 for shipping plus the $8 she doesn't get back from the book, which is $3 + $8 = $11.


$11.00 

"
"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two pairs, so that's $60.  Adding the $20 bag, she spends a total of $80.  If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars a month.  

* Week 1: He makes 8,000 bars.
* Week 2: He makes half of week 1, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* Week 3: He makes three times week 1, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

That's a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars for the first three weeks.

He needs to make 50,000 bars total, so in week 4 he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

"Okay, so Britany makes a lot of TikToks! Let's see... she makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes just for the videos.

Then she spends 2 hours on songs, and that's 2 times 60, so 120 minutes.

And she does her makeup for 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

Adding it all up, that's 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes a week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 282 times 4 = 1128 minutes on TikTok each month.

That's a lot of TikTok!

1128 

"
"Okay, so the basic installation is $129.  Let's see, she has 2 extra mirrors, so that's 2 times $15, which is $30. She has one extra chandelier, so that's another $15. And she has 10 extra pictures, so that's 10 times $15, which is $150.

Adding it all up: $129 + $30 + $15 + $150 = $324.00 


$324.00
"
"Okay, so Anthony saved $10 more than Eva, who has $20. That means Anthony has $30. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so figure out 40% of $30, which is $12.  Add that to Anthony's savings, and Roy has $42. 


$42.00
"
"Okay, so Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift 12 times that, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. Kagiyami can lift 4 times what Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift 12 * 4 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto can lift 10 times what Kagiyami can, meaning Naruto can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"
"Okay, so Mason bikes 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.

To find the total distance, we need to figure out how far he went each time and add them together.

* First part: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
* Second part: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles 

80 

"
"Okay, so if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 54 hours to cross the highway on its own.

If a turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it would take a turtle 108 hours to cross.

Since we have four turtles, we need to think about their combined speed.  It's like they're working together, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle.

That means it would take the four turtles 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.


27 

"
"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, meaning she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  To find the total, we add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


140 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $600, but it's $200 cheaper if she trades in her old one, so that's $600 - $200 = $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80, and she still needs $50, so she must have $150 + $80 + $50 = $280.

If she needs $50 more, that means she has $280 - $50 = $230 in her purse.


$230 

"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 big apples and each one makes 5 slices, that's 3 * 5 = 15 slices. Then he has 5 small apples and each one makes 3 slices, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 slices.  In total, he has 15 + 15 = 30 slices. If he eats 15, he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left.


15
"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 15 liters of milk a day now (5 liters per cow times 3 cows).  He wants 25 liters, so he needs 10 more liters (25 - 15 = 10). Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 2 more cows (10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 cows).


2 

"
"Okay, so each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters.  

* The first one has 1/6 left, so 5/6 is gone. That's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm used up.
* The second one has 1/3 left, meaning 2/3 is gone. That's (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm used up.
* The third one has 1/2 left, so 1/2 is gone. That's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm used up.

To find the total unused length, we add up the unused portions of each stick: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm


20 

"
"Okay, so Gabriel needs $10,800 in total. He already has $5200.  

If we subtract what he has from what he needs, that's $10,800 - $5200 = $5600.

$5600 

"
"Okay, so Thea gave the craftsman $80 because she used four $20 bills.  Since the hat only cost $70, she got $10 in change.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Craig starts with $40.  The squirt guns cost $12 and the water balloons cost $9, for a total of $21 spent.  That means he has $19 left.


$19 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they have a total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes. 


180
"
"Okay, so 5 students are good at only math, and 7 are good at both math and English.  That means 5 + 7 = 12 students are good at math.


12 

"
"Okay, so Vicki has 2 hours for the concert, which is 120 minutes.  She's taking out 10 minutes for intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the bands. Each band needs 10 minutes (2 on + 6 performing + 2 off).  If we divide the total time by the time per band, we get 110 minutes / 10 minutes/band = 11 bands.


11 

"
"Okay, so Brenda's investment earns $225 in interest each year (that's three-quarters of her original $300).  

After three years, she'll have earned $225 x 3 = $675 in interest.

Adding that to her original investment, she'll have $300 + $675 = $975.


$975 

"
"Okay, so half the white shirts have collars, meaning 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts don't have collars.  There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.

That means there are 30 - 20 = 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.


10 

"
"Okay, so the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30.  That means he has 900 / 30 = 30 trays of eggs.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75. 


$75 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y, for a total of 100 goats. He sells 10 from Farm X and 20 from Farm Y (since that's twice the amount from Farm X).  That means he sold 30 goats in total.

If he started with 100 goats and sold 30, he has 70 left.


70 

"
"Okay, so James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, and that's 2 * 12 = 24 pairs a year.

If he spends $2640 on shoes in a year, then each pair costs $2640 / 24 = $110. 


$110
"
"Okay, so you're buying 3 baskets of green food at $25 each, which is 3 * $25 = $75.

Then you're getting 3 baskets of red food, which normally cost $18 each, so that's 3 * $18 = $54. But you get $2 off each red basket, so you save 3 * $2 = $6.

That means the red food actually costs $54 - $6 = $48.

Finally, add the cost of the green and red food together: $75 + $48 = $123.


$123 

"
"Okay, so half of the 90 rooms is 45 rooms.  If each room takes 20 minutes to clean, that's 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes of cleaning.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is equal to 900 / 60 = 15 hours.


15 

"
"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build three times that many the next year, which is 12 * 3 = 36 houses.  That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 houses after two years.

In the third year, they double the number they've already built, so that's 48 * 2 = 96 houses.

Adding that to the houses from the first two years, they build a total of 48 + 96 = 144 houses.


144 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Let's say your age is ""x"".
* Your brother is 3 years older than you, so he's ""x + 3"".
* You're 2 years older than your sister, so she's ""x - 2"".
* Your mom is one less than three times your brother's age, making her ""3(x + 3) - 1"".

Now, if we add everyone's age together, it should equal 87:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Let's simplify that:

x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine the 'x' terms:

6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 13


So, you are 13 years old. 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks (27 students * 2 glue sticks each).  Since each pack has 8 glue sticks, he'll need to buy 7 packs to have enough. 


7 

"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons. After the rain, it doubles, which means it has 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. Then on the third day, it goes up by another 6000 gallons, so that's 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.


14000 

"
"Okay, so it starts with 10 people. Each of them infects 6 more people, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 new people on the first day.

Now there are 70 infected people (10 + 60). On day two, they each infect 6 more, so that's 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.

That brings the total to 490 (70 + 420). On day three, those 490 people each infect 6 others, so that's 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.

Adding that to the people already infected, we get 3430 (490 + 2940).


3430 

"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, so she made 20 * 40 = $800 in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so she made 10/100 * $800 = $80 less.

That means Julieta made $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

Together they made $800 + $720 = $1520.


$1520 

"
"Okay, so Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave her daughters a total of 6 oranges (3 daughters * 2 oranges each) and her son 3 oranges.  That means she gave away 9 oranges in total (6 + 3).

If she started with 12 and gave away 9, she has 3 oranges left. 


3
"
"Okay, so Claire gets 1 badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets 1 badge every 2 months. That means in a year, she gets 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges.

Wendy gets 3 times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

Wendy gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.


30 

"
"Okay, so Paige bakes for 5 hours and makes 2 loaves each hour, that's 10 loaves total.  Each loaf has 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices. If each slice sells for 50 cents, she makes 80 * $0.50 = $40.00.


$40.00 

"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and she has 70 gold coins.  That means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.  

In total, she has 70 + 40 = 110 coins.


110 

"
"Okay, so Mr. George had 600 burritos.  The students ate 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.  

Then Mr. George ate 20, for a total of 500 + 20 = 520 burritos eaten.

That means there were 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left over.


80 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars, which is 10 green cars.  They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so that's 30 blue cars.  That's a total of 52 red, green, and blue cars. Since they have 75 cars total, they must have 23 yellow cars. 


23
"
"Okay, so let's break this down.

We know Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books total.  Let's say Fawn has 'F' books. Anne has 12 less than Fawn, so she has F - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more than Anne, meaning she has (F - 12) + 25, which simplifies to F + 13 books.

To find out how many books Fawn has, we add up all their books and set it equal to 85:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28


So Fawn has 28 books. 

"
"Okay, so Daisy's sweet potatoes weighed twice as much as the 5-pound bag of potatoes, meaning they weighed 10 pounds.  Her carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so she bought 7 pounds of carrots. 


7
"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each, which is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.  Each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes. If each box costs $1.25, then he'll spend 12 * $1.25 = $15.00 on jello.


$15.00 

"
"Okay, so the phones cost $700 each, and he bought 5, so that's 700 times 5 which is 3500 bucks.  If he paid with 4000, the change would be 4000 minus 3500.  That's 500 dollars.


$500 

"
"Okay, so Madeline pays for most of the groceries, right?  If they spend $400 total and she pays 60%, that means Keenan pays $400 - ($400 * 0.60) = $160 for the whole month.

Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 each week.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Tobias ate a bunch of pizza over three days. Let's figure out how much he ate in total.

* **Day 1:** He ate 2/5 of the pizza, which is (2/5) * 60 pieces = 24 pieces.
* **Day 2:** He ate 10 more pieces.
* **Day 3:**  He had 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left. He ate 7/13 of those, which is (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces.

Adding it all up, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.


48 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much David has to pay.  

First, one bottle of soda costs $3.00 because $21.00 divided by 7 bottles is $3.00.

Then, one bottle of water costs $2.00 because $8.00 divided by 4 bottles is $2.00.

Three bottles of soda would cost $9.00 ($3.00 x 3).

Two bottles of water would cost $4.00 ($2.00 x 2).

In total, David would pay $13.00 ($9.00 + $4.00).


$13.00
"
"Okay, so David starts with $12.48 and each bolt costs $0.03.  He's buying 16 bolts, so that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 for all the bolts.  

If he spends $0.48, he'll have $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Ella makes $11 per hour walking dogs. If she works for 12 hours, she'd make $11 times 12, which is $132.


$132 

"
"Okay, so Paul starts with 52 marbles and gets 28 more, so he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then he loses 1/4 of them, which is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.


60 

"
"Okay, so Amy's doing pretty well on her history test!

* She gets 8 out of 10 multiple-choice right, which is 8 points.
* She nails 18 out of 20 true/false, so that's another 18 points.
* On the long answer, she gets 3 out of 5 right, which is 15 points.

Adding those up, she gets 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.


41 

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens.

That means he'll make 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000 from selling them.

Since he wants to make $2000 profit, he must have spent $9000 - $2000 = $7000 on the chickens.


$7000 

"
"Okay, so Julie sold 14 glasses.  Micah and Mitchell sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since they sold the same amount, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.  Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.


5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair. Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, which is $400 / 4 = $100.  Her pedicure cost 3/4 the price of her manicure, so that's $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


575 

"
"Okay, so Sarah makes $40 from selling her rope (20 meters * $2/meter).  The new rope costs her $30 (20 meters * $1.5/meter).  If she makes $40 and spends $30, she has $10 left over.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Melanie is going to be 18 in 10 years, which means she's 8 years old now.  If we want to know when she'll be three times her current age, that's 8 * 3 = 24 years old.  

So, she needs 24 - 8 = 16 more years.


16 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The bacon cost $10 for 5 packs, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.
* The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each pack is $2 * 2 = $4.
* Six packs of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.
* The strawberries are $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 * 3 = $12.
* The apples are half the price of the strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each.
* Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding up all the costs: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If Kelly had $65 and spent $60, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left. 


$5
"
"Okay, so Elaina's final concert is double the length of her normal ones, plus an extra 15 minutes for the encore.  We know the whole thing is 65 minutes long.

If we take away the encore time, the double-length concert is 65 - 15 = 50 minutes.

That means her regular concerts are 50 / 2 = 25 minutes long.


25 

"
"Let's see... Argo started with 200 toys and gave away 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.  

That means he has 200 - 150 = 50 toys left.


50 

"
"Okay, so they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Then on Friday they make double that, so that's 250 * 2 = 500 chimichangas.

In total, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas on those three days.


500 

"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't fit. That means 10 microphones won't have a spot (50 x 0.20 = 10).

That leaves 40 microphones that can be used (50 - 10 = 40). Since he's making pairs, he can make 20 pairs (40 / 2 = 20).


20 

"
"Okay, so Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then he sees 2/3 of that amount flying, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 birds.  He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Adding them all up: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds


34 

"
"Okay, so Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, leaving her with 50 cookies.  Then she split those evenly into 5 jars. That means each jar has 10 cookies. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Joelle's orchids have a total of 5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals. Her daisies have 4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals.  That means the daisies have 40 petals - 25 petals = 15 more petals than the orchids.


15
"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are inside, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25).  That leaves 75 plants left (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 50 plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering, which is 25%.


25 

"
"Okay, so a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and we know the whatchamacallit goes 121 meters per second.  That means the thingamabob spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

The whirligig is 5 times faster than the thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second.


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spends $11 total. Her salad is $6 and her yogurt is half that, so the yogurt is $3.  That means the salad and yogurt together cost $9.  

That leaves $11 - $9 = $2 for the carrots. Since she buys two carrots, each one costs $2 / 2 = $1.


$1 

"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is 40 hours total. His raise bumped him up to $12 an hour.  So to find out how much he makes in a week, you multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he works: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.


$480 

"
"This problem is tricky!  We know Tasha made $80 total, but we don't know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn.  

Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn 'x' times. That means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Since Joe pays $6 per mow, she made $6x from Joe's lawn. Kamala would be 3x * $6 = $18x, and Alba would be 5x * $6 = $30x.

To find out how much she made from lemonade, we'd subtract her total mowing earnings from her total earnings: $80 - ($6x + $18x + $30x).

But without knowing how many times she mowed Joe's lawn ('x'), we can't figure out exactly how much she made from lemonade. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Carl weighs 16 kg more than Martin, so he weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.
* Christian weighs 8 kg more than Carl, so he weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
* Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian, so he weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John rents his car out a lot! Let's see... he makes $25 each hour and rents it for 3 hours, so that's $25 * 3 = $75 per rental.

He does this 10 times a month, so he earns $75 * 10 = $750.

But he has to pay $500 for the car, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.


$250 

"
"Okay, so Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying more.  Before that, she had 2 (7 - 5 = 2). Joseph had 3 times that amount, meaning he had 6 notebooks (2 x 3 = 6).  Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph (7 - 6 = 1).


1 

"
"Okay, so Anis rowed 1/5 more than Dijana, which means he rowed an extra 50 / 5 = 10 miles.

That means Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Together they rowed 50 + 60 = 110 miles.


110 

"
"Okay, so Susan had 100 cookies, but her husband ate 4, leaving 96.  She has 6 nephews, so each one gets 96 divided by 6, which is 16 cookies.

"Okay, so Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 today (because she read 5 more than Daniel's 13 pages from yesterday). That's a total of 28 pages for Denise. Daniel only read 13 pages.  

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"
"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for 8 kid-sized bowls, which is the same as 4 adult bowls.  Since there are 4 people eating, they'll use up all the soup for dinner. That means there's none left over for lunch the next day.

"
"Okay, so William bought 5 notebooks at $1.50 each, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.  The pen cost $0.50, so in total he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Jo needs to figure out how much material she needs for all those masks. 

For the small masks, she uses 2 yards for 4 masks, so that's 0.5 yards per mask.  She needs 20 small masks, so that's 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

For the large masks, she uses 2.25 yards for 3 masks, which is 0.75 yards per mask. She needs 8 large masks, so that's 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

In total, she needs 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards of material.

"
"Okay, so Deepa saw 9 movies times 3 each, that's 27 times she went to the theater.  If she spent $216 total, then each ticket cost $216 divided by 27, which is $8.


$8 

"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 8 hours (since he works 2 hours less than he sleeps), and walks his dog for 1 hour.  That's a total of 19 hours.  

Since there are 24 hours in a day, he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time.

5 

"
"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He uses 3 blue ones and a third of his red ones, which is 9 / 3 = 3 red boxes.

That means he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left and 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.

In total, he has 4 + 6 = 10 shoeboxes left.

"
"Joseph started with 9 * 2 = 18 books. After losing some, he has 18 - 2 = 16 books left.

16 

"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (30 / 5 = 6) and then another 10 to Donald.  That means he gave away a total of 16 marbles (6 + 10 = 16).  

If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left (30 - 16 = 14).


14 

"
"Okay, so Duncan is 60 now, which means he was 52 eight years ago.  The problem says that was twice Adam's age four years ago. So Adam was 52 / 2 = 26 four years ago. That means Adam is currently 30 years old (26 + 4). In eight years, Adam will be 38 (30 + 8).


38 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Smith's farm is tricky. It's twice the size of Farmer Brown's (200 acres * 2 = 400 acres) plus another 100 acres, so that's 500 acres.  

To find the total, we add both farms together: 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres.


700 

"
"Okay, so Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does 10 less than 50 an hour, so that's 40 packages.  That means he makes 40 * $0.20 = $8.00 each hour.  If he works 8 hours, he makes $8.00 * 8 = $64.00.


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times longer than a normal one, which is 45 minutes.  That means it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

He drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, so in 180 minutes he drinks 180 / 30 = 6 bottles.


6 

"
"Okay, so Benny used 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon and he had 20 red balloons, that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna right there.  He used 58 pieces total, so that means he used 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna on the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces, he must have had 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.


6 

"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles a day and needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  If he drives for a whole month, that's 30 days times 100 miles a day, which is 3000 miles.  Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3 tune-ups that month. 


3
"
"Okay, so Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.  Then on Wednesday he works twice that, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 hours. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total, we add up the hours for all three days: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.


23
"
"Okay, so they spent $11 on a cake, $3 on balloons (since a dozen is 12 balloons and they cost $0.50 for 2), and $14 on ice cream (2 tubs x $7).  That's a total of $28.

Since they split the cost, their mom gave each of them $14. 


$14

"
"Okay, so there are 6 tennis players and double that for volleyball, which is 12.  That's 18 kids playing tennis or volleyball. Then there's 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, for a total of 38 soccer players.  Adding those together, there are 18 + 38 = 56 students.


56 

"
"Okay, so they sold 300 lollipops in total (30 students * 10 lollipops each).  

If they sold them for 80 cents each, they made $240 (300 lollipops * $0.80/lollipop).

They spent $150 to buy the lollipops (300 lollipops * $0.50/lollipop).

That means they made a profit of $90 ($240 - $150).


$90 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Larry has 9 dogs because he has three times as many dogs as his 3 cats.
* He has 7 rabbits because he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
* He has 21 fish because he has three times as many fish as rabbits.
* He has 7 gerbils because that's one-third the number of fish he has.

Adding all his pets up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.


47 

"
"Okay, so Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice that, which is 4 slices. Together they eat 6 slices a day.  Since the loaf has 24 slices, it will last them 24 / 6 = 4 days.

"
"Martha collects shells for 5 years (from age 5 to age 10). Since she gets one shell each month, and there are 12 months in a year, she'll have 5 * 12 = 60 shells.


60 

"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups and splits them into 3 rows, that means each row gets 9 cups (27 / 3 = 9).  Since she wants the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row, she'll have 4.5 cups of each (9 / 2 = 4.5).


4.5 

"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each round trip to get berries.  If he has 8 hours, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours/trip = 2 trips.

To get 24 berries in 2 trips, he needs to grab 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries each time he goes down.


12 

"
"Okay, so the pool has 10,000 gallons, and they use half of that to fill the tank, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.  

They use 500 gallons each day, so after 6 days they'll have used 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons.

That means there will be 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left in the tank.


2000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Colby has $150 for movies this month. He already spent some on tickets and snacks:

* Friday/Saturday movies: 5 movies * $10/movie = $50
* Other day movies: 8 movies * $7/movie = $56
* Popcorn: 2 tubs * $8/tub = $16
* Candy: 4 boxes * $2/box = $8

That's a total of $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130 spent.

He has $150 - $130 = $20 left. Since tickets are $10 on Fridays, he can see $20 / $10/movie = 2 movies tonight. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Andrew baked a bunch of mini pastries.  Let's see...

* A regular cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one has a third of that, so each mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.
* A regular blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

* He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.
* He made 300 mini blueberry muffins, so that's 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

* In total, all the pastries have 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.


85000 

"
"Okay, so Rita removed a bunch of Junebugs. Let's see...

* Tuesday and Wednesday she got twice the amount from Monday, so that's 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day.
* That's 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days.
*  Adding up all the days, it's 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs total.
* To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"
"Okay, so the bus traveled for 5 hours at 60 miles per hour, so it went 5 * 60 = 300 miles. The car traveled for 8 hours at 30 miles per hour, so it went 8 * 30 = 240 miles.  The bus went 300 - 240 = 60 miles farther than the car.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Sophie has 62 toys in total.  She has 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings, which adds up to 48 toys.  

To find out how many bouncy balls she has, we subtract the known toys from the total: 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls.


14 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out Peter's age.  

We know:

* Peter, Paul, and John's ages add up to 100.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

Let's think about it this way:

If we know Paul's age and John's age, we can just add them together to find Peter's age.  We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, so let's say John is ""x"" years old. That means Paul is ""x + 10"" years old.

Now we can add up all their ages: x + (x + 10) + Peter = 100

Combining like terms: 2x + 10 + Peter = 100

To get Peter by himself, let's subtract 10 from both sides: 2x + Peter = 90

Now, we need to figure out what ""x"" is.  We don't have enough information to know John's exact age, but we know that Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages.

Since Peter's age is 2x + 10, and that's also equal to Paul's age plus John's age, we can say:

2x + 10 = (x + 10) + x

Simplifying: 2x + 10 = 2x + 10

This tells us that the information we have is consistent, but we can't find a specific age for Peter without more information about John or Paul's age. 



"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons for her friends.  She has 1 balloon, so that's 8 + 1 = 9 balloons total at first. Then her mom gives everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 more balloons.  Adding those to the first amount, they have 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.


24 

"
"Okay, so they have a lot of stuff! Let's see... 10 people gave 5 boxes each, so that's 50 boxes. Plus the 10 they already had, that's 60 boxes total.  If each table holds 2 boxes, they'll need 30 tables. Since they only have 15, they need to find 15 more.


15 

"
"Okay, so Zoey spits her seeds 40 times * 10 feet each = 400 feet total. Sydney spits hers 35 times * 12 feet each = 420 feet.  

To find the average, you add those together (400 + 420 = 820 feet) and then divide by 2 because there are two people. 820 / 2 = 410 feet.

"
"Okay, so Fern wants to make the most money, right?

The Widgeteer 3000 makes way more widgets than the WidgetMaster 9000. It makes 60 an hour, and the other one only makes 45.  If it runs all day, every day for a month, that's a lot of extra widgets!

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 will definitely make her more money.  Let me see... 60 widgets an hour times 24 hours is 1440 widgets a day. Times 30 days, that's 43,200 widgets a month!

The WidgetMaster 9000 only makes 1080 a day, so that's only 32,400 a month.

43,200 minus 32,400 is 10,800 more widgets from the Widgeteer 3000.

10,800 widgets times $6 each is... $64,800 more!


Answer: 64800 

"
"Okay, so Cameron stays for 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  

So, he has to pay for 5 extra hours, which is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

That means his total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

A full 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos, so he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.


250 

"
"Okay, so each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  The sheep eat 3 pounds less than twice what the goats eat, so they eat (2 * 5) - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

There are 15 goats, so they need 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

There are 12 sheep, so they need 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

159 

"
"Okay, so John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.

He spends $50 on gas, and then wants to save $100, so that's $50 + $100 = $150 gone.

He also buys 5 pencils at $10 each, which is 5 * $10 = $50.

That means he's spent a total of $150 + $50 = $200.

He started with $300 and spent $200, leaving him with $300 - $200 = $100.

Each pen costs $25, so he can buy $100 / $25 = 4 pens. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, that's 20 * 15 = 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than that, so he spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters worth of words.  

To find the total, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters: 300 + 350 = 650 letters.


650 

"
"Okay, so each school has 7 rows of 8 kids, so that's 7 times 8 which is 56 kids per school.  Since there are 5 schools, we multiply that by 5: 56 times 5 equals 280.

280 

"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons and each one gets her 100 bottles of juice, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.  Then she gives each of the 29 kids 2 bottles, which is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.  That means she has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left for herself.


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come over, then $35 for every hour she works.  Since she worked 2.25 hours, that's 2.25 times $35, which is $78.75.  Then you gotta add the $60 for parts.  So the total is $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75.


$178.75
"
"Okay, so James got a good deal on those CDs! Let's see...

* He saved $60 with the discount, so he only paid $90 for all 10 CDs.
* Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, making him $200.
*  That means he made $110 overall.


$110 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will make.

* Her yams will earn her 6 * $1.50 = $9.00
* Her sweet potatoes will earn her 10 * $2.00 = $20.00
* Her carrots will earn her 4 * $1.25 = $5.00

If she sells everything, she'll make a total of $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00


$34.00
"
"Okay, so James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles.  

At 2 miles per hour, that takes him 6 hours (12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours).

He rests for half that time, so 3 hours.

That leaves 8 miles to go (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles).

But now he's swimming slower, only 1 mile per hour (2 mph / 2 = 1 mph).

So, the last part takes him 8 hours (8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours).

Adding it all up: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.


17 

"
"Okay, so the bakery has seven times the number of loaves Sam had, which is 7 * 70 = 490.  But then they have 40 less than that, so 490 - 40 = 450.

"
"Let's break it down:

* Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.
* She loses 7, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.
* Her teacher gives her 5 more, so she ends up with 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.


13 

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10% of the price of each New York Times, which is $5. That means he makes $0.50 on each one. Since he sells 6, he makes $3.00 from those.

For the Wall Street Journal, he makes 8% of $15, which is $1.20 per paper. He sells 10 of those, so he makes $12.00 from those.

In total, he makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00 in commission.


$15.00
"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, which means Marcus is 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be twice Marcus's age. That means Leo is 42 years old. 

42 

"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most points, and we know the total points were 45.  Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.  

Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points.

Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

Adding up all their scores: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Azibo scored 5 points. 

"
"Okay, so the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages.  That means there are 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages in the book. 

150 

"
"Okay, so Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 hours total. That's 900 minutes (15 hours * 60 minutes/hour).

If he staples for 15 minutes at a time, he does that 60 times in 900 minutes (900 minutes / 15 minutes/set = 60 sets).

So, he staples a total of 1800 reports (60 sets * 30 reports/set).


1800 

"
"Okay, so Kim normally sleeps for 8 hours. That's 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for 23 minutes, so we subtract that: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.  Then she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract that too: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.


452 

"
"Okay, so Jonathan has 24 cups (two dozen). He has 2/3 that many spoons, which is 16 spoons.  After he gives 6 spoons to Pedro, he has 10 spoons left.  That means he has a total of 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils.


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, which is 200 beds. That means 800 beds are empty.

They get 50 new patients every day, and there are 14 days in two weeks, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

That means there will be 200 + 700 = 900 patients in the hospital after two weeks.

So, there will be 1000 - 900 = 100 empty beds left.


Answer: 100 

"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  She uses 7 for work, so that leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 go to family, which is 6 emails. That means 3 emails are left for her boyfriend.


3 

"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, making her 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he's 5 * 9 = 45 years old.


45 

"
"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people, but she overestimated by 20%.  That means the real number is 20% less than 48.

To find out 20% of 48, I do (20/100) * 48 = 9.6.

Then I subtract that from Courtney's number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since you can't have part of a person, there must have been about 38 people at the concert.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls.  Jeffrey carried half that amount, which is 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  In total, they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.


7 

"
"Okay, so they dug a bunch of holes over a few days.  Let's see...

* Day 1: 10 holes
* Day 2: 13 holes
* Day 3: 8 holes, but they filled in 2, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 holes left from day 3.
* Total so far: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one. That means there were 29 holes / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of day one.  Since you can't have part of a hole, I'm guessing the map wasn't totally accurate.

Anyway, they had 29 holes at the start of day four, and 7 at the end of day one, so they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on day four.


22 

"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips, and Collins got 15 more than that, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400. His travel tickets cost 50% more than that, so we need to figure out what 50% of $400 is.  

Half of $400 is $200, so his tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600.


$600
"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught.  

Let's see... Adelwolfe caught some, let's call that number 'A'. Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount, so that's 4A - 13. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so that's (4A - 13) + 5.

All together they caught 339, so A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13) + 5 = 339.

Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Now we can plug that back into the equation for Stan: 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147.



Stan caught 147 Pokemon. 

"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes long.  And there are half as many episodes as minutes in each episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

If he watches all 10 episodes, that's 10 * 20 = 200 minutes of watching.


200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between the homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.


374 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Greta made 12 brownies.
* Her office gave her 6 more (half a dozen).
* Her friends brought 48 brownies (4 dozen).
* That's a total of 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.
* They ate 18 brownies (1 and a half dozen).
* So, Greta has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left. 


48
"
"Okay, so Nani is 8. His brother is twice that age, so he's 8 * 2 = 16.  His sister is 25% younger than Nani, so she's 8 * 0.25 = 2 years younger, making her 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

To find their total age, we add them up: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30


30 

"
"Okay, so Andy has to string a bunch of racquets with different types of string.  

* He's got 3 with synthetic gut, and those take 15 minutes each, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
* Then he has 5 with polyester, which take 22 minutes each, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
* Finally, there are 4 hybrid ones that take 18 minutes each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

To find the total time, we add all those up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, which is $600 each, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200.

The other two phones are half price, so they each cost $600 / 2 = $300.

That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

In total, he spent $1200 + $600 = $1800 on all the phones.


$1800 

"
"Okay, so Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13. That means Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.  

To find the total, we add the number of players on both teams: 20 + 13 = 33 players.


33 

"
"Okay, so Robert needs to find out how much fencing he needs first.  Since it's a rectangle, you add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

He needs 2 slats for every foot, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.


100 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington starts with 12 boxes of oranges. She gives away 4 boxes, leaving her with 8. She keeps a quarter of those, which is 2 boxes. That means she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.


120 

"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states.  Half of that is 25, and India has 4 more than that, so they have 29 states.  If you add those together, there are 79 states in total.

79 

"
"Okay, so Tyler needs to figure out how much money he still needs and then how many hours he has to work to earn that.

The books cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $39 total.

He already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

If he earns $5 an hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 10 less than that, which is 20 cherries.  That means Richard and Robert have a total of 50 cherries. Since they have 60 cherries total, Jerry must have 10. Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 gingerbread and 6 apple pies (10 - 4).
* That's $60 from gingerbread (10 x $6) and $90 from apple pies (6 x $15).

* On Sunday, he sold 15 gingerbread (10 + 5) and 15 apple pies.
* That's $90 from gingerbread (15 x $6) and $225 from apple pies (15 x $15).

* Total for Saturday was $150 ($60 + $90) and for Sunday was $315 ($90 + $225).

*  Adding those together, Sunny made $465 over the two days. 


$465
"
"Okay, so she needs an ounce of sunscreen every hour, and she's outside for 4 hours a day. That means she uses 4 ounces a day.  Over 8 days, she'll need 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen. Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.


4 

"
"Okay, so the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which costs $100.  That means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price.  

To find out how much the red car costs, we multiply the blue car's price by 60%: $100 * 0.60 = $60.

Finally, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car and the blue car: $60 + $100 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now and in 5 years he'll be 24.  At that time, his dad will be twice his age, which is 48.  That means his dad is 43 now (48 - 5).  

Emil will also be twice his brother's age when he's 24, so his brother will be 12 then. That means his brother is 7 now (12 - 5).

If you add their ages, 43 + 7 = 50.


50 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Adrianne's sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
* Her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads.
* In total, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.


90 

"
"Okay, so Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday, then 3 times that on Friday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he did on Friday, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

In total, he has 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings. 


7 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the class are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students.

That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then 25% of those students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early. 


12
"
"Okay, so Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots, meaning Charlie wears a size 25.  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 because there are two people.  30 divided by 2 is 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Pat needs to figure out how many more plants she needs and then how much that will cost.

First, let's figure out how many plants will fit in her flower bed. It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12). Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants). So, she can fit 44.4 plants (1332 / 30). Since she can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants total.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17).

Each plant costs $6, so 28 plants will cost $168 (28 x 6).


$168 

"
"Okay, so Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. That means his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  

Over a week, he'd eat 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.


63 

"
"Okay, so Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3 each, which is 3 * $3 = $9. She also needs 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.  

That means each basket costs $9 + $5 = $14 to fill. Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost is $14 * 5 = $70.


$70.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 30 pounds of soil. Sunflowers take up 3 pounds each, and they're planting 4, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. Carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and they're doing 10, so that's 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.  

That means the sunflowers and carnations use up 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.  They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for roses. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Jessica saves 25% of her $2000 paycheck, which is $500 each month.  That means she saves $500 x 12 = $6000 a year. Since each pair of shoes costs $1000, she can buy $6000 / $1000 = 6 pairs of shoes.


6 

"
"Okay, so Emily peels shrimp pretty fast.  She can do 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Cooking is a bit slower. She does 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it'd take her 3 times as long, which is 30 minutes.

To get the total time, we add the peeling and cooking time: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.


45 

"
"Okay, so the AC cools the room down a bit each hour.  

* On low, it cools by 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 degrees cooler.
* Then on high, it cools by 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 degrees cooler.
* That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.
* But then it warms up by 2 degrees each hour for 2 hours, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 degrees warmer.
* So overall, the room is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it started.


14
"
"Okay, so Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30. Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

The comet comes around every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it the second time. That means one full cycle of the comet had to pass before Bill was old enough to see it.

So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet. 

75 

"
"Okay, let's see...

He writes one check each month for electric and gas, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives two checks to the church every month, so that's 24 checks a year (2 x 12). And for the pest and lawn service, he writes one check every three months, so that's 4 checks a year (1 x 4).

Adding those all up: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks.


52 

"
"Okay, so the second plane takes 44 trips, and that's only half the number the first plane takes. That means the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights to Greece.

The rest of the flights, 88 - 66 = 22, are split between France and Germany. So, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.


11 

"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total time, we add up all their howl times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, they howl for a total of 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.


2 

"
"Okay, so Adam's dad gave him twice the amount his mom gave him, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Together, his parents gave him $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to pay $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.


$12 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The average age of the four kids is 20 / 4 = 5 years old.

Helene is twice the average age, so she's 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.

That means Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene are a total of 10 + 7 = 17 years old.

If all four kids are 20 years old together, then Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old. 


3
"
"Okay, so Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 online, that's $2000 total. His lawyer is going to give three times that much, so that's $2000 times 3 which is $6000.  

6000 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 guests and each brought 15 cookies, that's 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies total.  The bride gave half of those to the church, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people at the church.


50 

"
"Okay, so there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid.  

Think of it like this: if each kid got 1 slice, the adults would each get 2 slices. That means the adults get a total of 4 slices (2 adults * 2 slices each).

Since there are 6 people total, and they're splitting the watermelon into 6 slices (4 for adults + 2 for kids), each adult gets 4 slices out of 6.

That means each adult gets 66.67% of the watermelon (4/6 * 100%).


**Answer:** 66.67 

"
"Okay, so Dr. Jones works 9 hours.  He spends 20 minutes per patient on rounds, and he has 9 patients, so that's 9 times 20 minutes, which is 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours (180 divided by 60). His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 5 hours (300 minutes divided by 60).  

So, rounds take 3 hours and appointments take 5 hours, for a total of 8 hours. That leaves him with 1 hour for records (9 hours - 8 hours).


1 

"
"Okay, so Jordan needs to figure out when to start baking to have the cake ready by 5:00 pm. 

Let's see, it takes 20 minutes to make the batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours (which is 120 minutes) to cool, and another 10 minutes to frost.  That's a total of 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours. So, she needs to start baking 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

That means she should start at 2:00 pm.


2:00 pm 

"
"Okay, so they sold 8 boxes in total (3.5 + 4.5).  Since they sold 64 chocolate bars all together, there must be 8 chocolate bars in each box (64 / 8 = 8).


8 

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the studio, and then $1.50 for each student. With 10 students, that's $1.50 x 10 = $15 extra per session.

So each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They have classes 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 per week.

In a month, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480.


$480 

"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split evenly into 4 boxes, meaning he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars per box. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.  Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines (50 * 3/5 = 30).

Each female has 4 babies a month, so that's 120 babies born each month (30 * 4 = 120).

Over a year, that's 1440 babies (120 * 12 = 1440).

Adding those to the original population, there would be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year (50 + 1440 = 1490).


1490 

"
"Okay, so they need to figure out how much water their pool holds.  

* First, you multiply the length, width, and depth: 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

* Then, they said to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

* Finally, they charge $0.10 per gallon, so it'll cost 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.00 to fill.


$826.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, meaning there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add up all the sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.


34 

"
"Okay, so Matteo drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, which means he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so half of the 3000 students are over 16, which is 1500 students.  A quarter of those are guys, so that's 375 guys over 16. That means 1125 of the students over 16 are girls.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are guys, so that's 750 guys under 16. That leaves 750 girls under 16.

Adding those together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls at the school. 


1875
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, so he runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, meaning she runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so she runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Finally, Bethany runs 10 laps and Quinn runs 5, so Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. 


5
"
"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill this big tank.  

On the first day, Wanda fills a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumps 4500 * (3/4) = 3375 gallons. Together they put in 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps 1/3 of her day one amount, so she pumps 3375 * (1/3) = 1125 gallons. That's another 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

The tank needs 18000 gallons, so they still need to pump 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.



6000
"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank lost a bunch of charge while she was at the park.  

First, it lost 9% each hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.

Then it lost 7% each hour for 3 hours, which is 7 * 3 = 21% more gone.

That's a total of 45 + 21 = 66% of the battery used up.

So, if 66% is gone, that means 100% - 66% = 34% was left.

But we know it ended up at 28%, so her friends used up 34% - 28% = 6% of the battery.

That 6% they used was part of the 34% that was left after the battery drained on its own.  

So, if 6% is like a piece of the 34% pie, we can figure out what the whole pie (the original charge) was.

It's like saying 6 out of 34 is the same as some number out of 100.

If you do the math (6 / 34) * 100 = about 17.65%.

So, Maria's power bank was probably about 17.65% charged when she left for the park.


**Answer:** 17.65% 

"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour at her job plus $15 an hour in tips, so that's $25 an hour total. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 times 40, which is $1000 a week.

She needs 20% of $10,000 for a down payment, so that's $10,000 times 0.20, which is $2000.

To figure out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings: $2000 divided by $1000 is 2.


2 

"
"Okay, let's see... Jamaar spent $1.50 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $2.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples. That's a total of $9.25.  

He started with $10.00, so he has $0.75 left. Since plums cost $0.25 each, he can buy 3 plums. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Anne has 15 packs of sweets with 60 in each pack, that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets total. She keeps 2 packs for herself, so that's 2 * 60 = 120 sweets.  That leaves 900 - 120 = 780 sweets to give to her friends.  She has 10 friends, so each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.


78 

"
"Okay, so the price goes up by 5% each year.  

* After one year, it's $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126
* After two years, it's $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* After three years, it's $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139. 



"
"Okay, so Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, which means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.

She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.

She has 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.

In total, she has 27 + 18 = 45 portraits and selfies. 

45 

"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18. That's 18 / 3 = 6 sets of pages.

Since each set takes 10 minutes, he reads for a total of 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.


60 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 guests at first. Then 24 left early, so there were 100 - 24 = 76 left.

Then 15 people wanted to check out late, but twice that many, or 15 * 2 = 30 people, checked in.

So now there are 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 106 + 7 = 113 guests.


113 

"
"Okay, so John picks bananas over three days. Let's add them up:

* Wednesday: 4 bananas
* Thursday: 6 bananas
* Friday: 4 bananas * 3 = 12 bananas

Total: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bananas


22 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.  40% of them are easy, which is 60 * 0.40 = 24 questions. That leaves 36 questions that are either average or difficult.

Since they're split evenly, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct.

She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right. 


36
"
"Okay, so Teresa sells the big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones.  She sold twice as many small ones as big ones and made $120 total.  Since each small one costs $4, we know she made 4 * (number of small ones) dollars from the small ones.

Let's say she sold 'x' big stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small ones.

The big ones cost $12 each, so she made 12x dollars from those.

All together, her earnings are: 12x + 4(2x) = $120

Combining like terms: 12x + 8x = $120

That means 20x = $120

Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 6.

She sold 6 big stuffed animals, which means she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.


12 

"
"Okay, so they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.  

In a week, that's 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches.


77 

"
"Okay, so Suzanne made $80 from the cookies and $240 from the cupcakes, for a total of $320.  Then she gave her sisters $20. That means she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the twins found 30 eggs each, which is 60 eggs total.  They also found 10 more eggs, so that's 70 eggs found by the twins and their friends.  That means the friends found 30 eggs (100 total eggs - 70 eggs).


30 

"
"Okay, so one dwarf can mine 36 pounds a day with a steel pickaxe.  That means in a month, one dwarf mines 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

If you have 40 dwarves, they'd mine 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds.


43200 

"
"Okay, so the store sells sandwiches in packs of 2 for $3 and packs of 4 for $6. That means each sandwich costs $1.50 ($6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich).

If you want 8 sandwiches, it would cost $12.00 (8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.00).


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Tom's new bedroom set costs $3000, but he gets $1000 from selling his old one. That means he still owes $2000.  If he has to pay 10% of that each month, it's $2000 times 0.10, which equals $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* First, Sally loses 40% of her red balloons: 25 balloons * 0.40 = 10 balloons.
* That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.
* She loses half her yellow balloons: 12 balloons / 2 = 6 balloons.
* So she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.
* She finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them: 8 balloons * 0.75 = 6 balloons.
* Finally, she has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons. 


27
"
"Okay, so there's a 50/50 chance he'll get a sub, and if he does, he's off the hook.  If his regular teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone more time.  Even if she doesn't, there's still a 20% chance he can get out of it by saying his dog ate it.

So, let's see... 50% chance of no homework, plus 20% chance of an extension, plus 6% chance of the dog excuse working... that means there's a 76% chance he doesn't have to do it.

That leaves 24% chance he actually has to turn it in.

"Okay, so they have 6000 seats total and take out the 950 for the grads and 300 for the teachers. That leaves 4750 seats for everyone else.  If they split those evenly between the 950 grads, each grad gets 5 tickets.

"
"Okay, so Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans because that's double the amount of large ones.  Since 3 small beans equal one medium bean, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.


450 

"
"Okay, so Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total.

She makes $15 each day, so for 3 days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.

Parking costs $3 a day, so over 3 days it's $3 * 3 = $9.

If she makes $45 and spends $9 on parking, she has $45 - $9 = $36 left.

So, she makes $36 for 18 hours of work, which means she makes $36 / 18 = $2 per hour after paying for parking.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Ted spent $48 on books (3 books * $16/book) and $18 on pencils (3 pencils * $6/pencil).  

That means he spent a total of $66. 

66 

"
"Okay, so Richard has a driveway that's 24 feet wide and he wants to put a soda bottle every 3 feet. That means he can fit 8 bottles (24 / 3 = 8).

Since he takes 5 seconds to get to each bottle, and there are 7 spaces between the 8 bottles, it'll take him 35 seconds to set them all up (7 * 5 = 35).


35 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes with 40 apples each, that's 2 * 40 = 80 apples total.  If he puts 8 apples in each pack, he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs.


10 

"
"Okay, so Amor buys $22 worth of Parmesan (2 pounds * $11/pound) and $18 worth of mozzarella (3 pounds * $6/pound). That means she spends a total of $40 on cheese. If she started with $50, she'll have $10 left for meat.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Jim borrowed a lot of money for college, $50,000 each year for four years. That's $200,000 total! Plus, he couldn't work while he was studying, so he missed out on making $25,000 a year for four years. That's another $100,000.

So, he needs to make back $300,000. His new job pays him $75,000 a year, so it will take him 4 years to earn that much. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jim needs the fabric to be bigger than his bed.  

He wants it 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider on each side. That means the fabric needs to be 10 feet long (6 + 2 + 2) and 12 feet wide (8 + 2 + 2).

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday.  On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount, so that's 425 / 5 = 85 letters, plus 17 more, for a total of 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's (102 * 2) + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total, we add up all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.


736
"
"Okay, so Molly has 16 people coming to the party.  10 want chicken salad at $6.50 each, so that's 10 * $6.50 = $65.00. Then 6 people want pasta salad at $6.00 each, so that's 6 * $6.00 = $36.00.  

To find the total, we add those together: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00


$101.00 

"
"Okay, so Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second race.  But on the third race, he lost $16.50.  

To find the average, you add up all the losses: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

Then divide that by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.

So his average loss was $7.17.


$7.17
"
"Okay, so there are 26 countries in South America, and each one has 5 cities with 1000 people in each city.  To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of people in each country.

That's 26 countries * 5 cities/country * 1000 people/city = 130,000 people


130,000 

"
"Okay, so Xavier grew to be 51 inches tall (4 feet is 48 inches plus 3 more inches). Cole is now 52 inches tall (50 inches plus 2 inches).  That means Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier.

"
"Let's call the first person's share ""x"". The second person got x + $80, and the third person got 2 * (x + $80), which is 2x + $160.

Together, they got x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420. 


$420
"
"Okay, so they worked 3/8 of a day each day, which is like 9 hours (3/8 * 24 hours).  They did that for 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days a week). So each painter worked 189 hours total.

189 

"
"Okay, so Rory picked up a different number of balls in each set.  Let's use some algebra to figure this out.

* Let's say he got 'x' balls in the second set.
* The first set had 'x + 4' balls (4 more than the second).
* The third set had 'x / 2' balls (half the second set).

All together, he got 19 balls, so:

x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, he got 6 balls in the second set.  

That means he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so the car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, it would be worth 20000 - (20000 * 0.21) = $15800
* In 2009, it would be worth 15800 - (15800 * 0.21) = $12478
* In 2010, it would be worth 12478 - (12478 * 0.21) = $9860.62


9860.62 

"
"Okay, so half the books are in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.  Then 10% are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English or German.  

The rest must be in Spanish, so there are 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.


20 

"
"Okay, so Bernice wants to drive from San Diego to New York. That's a long trip!  

If she drives 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, she'll have driven 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers.

To find out how much farther she has to go, we subtract that from the total distance: 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers.


655 

"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups a day, and there are 16 cups in a gallon.  That means she drinks 8/16 = 0.5 gallons each day.

Over 30 days, she'd drink 0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons.


15 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

* The train starts with 120 people.
* At the first stop, 20 more get on, so there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.
* At the second stop, 50 get off, and then twice that amount, 100, get on. So now there are 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.
* Finally, 80 people get off at the third stop, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people.


110
"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent.

* Her shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.
* Her shoes were $48 / 2 = $24 since they were half off.
* Her socks were $8 - $2 = $6 with the coupon.

Adding it all up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55


55 

"
"Okay, so you need to cover 200 square feet.  Each tile is one square foot, so you'll need 200 tiles. If each tile costs $12, then you'll spend 200 * $12 = $2400.


$2400 

"
"Okay, so his insurance went up because of the accident.  It's 60% more than the normal $120 a month.  

First, I need to figure out how much extra he pays: 60% of $120 is $72.

So now his monthly payment is $120 + $72 = $192.

For a whole year, that's $192 * 12 = $2304.


$2304 

"
"Okay, so Greg washes sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed each week. His washer can only handle 2 sets of twin sheets at once and 1 set of king sheets.

Let's see... that means he needs to do 4 twin beds / 2 per load = 2 loads of twin sheets. Plus, he needs to do 1 load of king sheets.

So, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry each week.

Over a year, that's 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.


156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, which is 2 movies. That means they watch a total of 6 movies each weekend.  Over 4 weeks, they'd watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.


24 

"
"Okay, so Leo started with 100 stickers. Last year he got 50 more, bringing his total to 150. This year he got double the amount from last year, which is 100 stickers.  Adding that to his total, he now has 250 stickers.


250 

"
"Okay, so Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of food each, twice a day. That means she uses 3 * 60 * 2 = 360 grams of food per day.  If she has 720 grams, it will last 720 / 360 = 2 days.


2 

"
"Okay, so they had 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, that's a total of 4 * 8 = 32 slices.  Becky ate 10, and we know she ate 3 more than Jake, so Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as much as Jake, meaning she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Adding up all the slices they ate: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.


31 

"
"Let 'x' be the time Donovan spent cooking. Betsy took x + 18 minutes. Together they cooked for 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98.  Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40.

Donovan cooked for 40 minutes, and Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.


58 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The cast costs $200.
* The doctor charges $300 an hour, and the visit was 30 minutes, which is half an hour, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.
* The painkillers are $4 each, and she got 30, so that's $4 * 30 = $120.
* Parking is $6 an hour, and she had to park for 2 hours, so that's $6 * 2 = $12.

Adding it all up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482


482 

"
"Okay, so James gets a ton of emails!  

First, we gotta figure out how many emails he actually has to answer. If 20% don't need a reply, that means 80% do.  So, 80 emails * 0.80 = 64 emails need a response each day.

Then, over a 5 day work week, he answers 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.


320 

"
"Okay, so they had a lot of classes visit! Let's see...

* Tuesday had twice as many as Monday, so that's 32 * 2 = 64 classes.
* Wednesday had three times as many as Monday, so that's 32 * 3 = 96 classes.
*  Adding those all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes


247 

"
"Okay, so to find the average, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.  

He got 100 three times and then an 80, so that's 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 total.

Then you divide that by 4 tests: 380 / 4 = 95

His average score is 95. 

"
"Okay, so the glee club ate most of their pizzas! They had 20 and ate 70%, which is 14 pizzas (20 x 0.70 = 14). That leaves them with 6 pizzas.

The football team ordered double, so they had 40 pizzas (20 x 2 = 40). They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas (40 x 0.80 = 32).  They have 8 left over (40 - 32 = 8).

Adding the leftovers, there are 14 pizzas left in total (6 + 8 = 14).


14
"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out a lot of coupons!  He's sending twice as many big coupons as small ones, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The small coupons cost 5 cents each, so those will cost 700 * $0.05 = $35.00 to mail.

The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so mailing those will be 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.

Adding those together, his total postage cost is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00.


$245.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* Sidney starts with 7 sandwiches (10 - 3).
* That's 28 meatballs (7 * 4).
* Mark eats 4 sandwiches, leaving Sidney with 3 (7 - 4).
* Those 3 sandwiches have 12 meatballs (3 * 4).
* Sidney gets 3 more sandwiches, for a total of 6 (3 + 3).
* That's 24 more meatballs (6 * 4).
* In total, Sidney has 36 meatballs (12 + 24). 


36
"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks, and a quarter of them broke down. That means 20 / 4 = 5 trucks had problems.

So, 20 - 5 = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

Each truck had 20 tons, so they delivered 15 * 20 = 300 tons of fertilizer.


300 

"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter per dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

The store has a deal where you buy one pound and get half off another. So, for every two pounds he buys, he only pays for one and a half.

He needs 6 pounds, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 sets of the deal.

That means he pays full price for 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

And he gets 3 pounds at half price, which is $4.00/pound * 0.50 = $2.00 per pound.

So the discounted butter costs 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00

In total, the butter will cost him $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00



$18.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, Kayla invited 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

Then, 4 people can't make it, so 45 - 4 = 41 people are coming.

Since the theater costs $6 extra for each person over 20, that's 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

So, the extra cost is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding that to the base price, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251. 


251
"
"Okay, so Maggie and Riza both started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter of hers, which is $60 / 4 = $15.  Riza spent a third of hers, which is $60 / 3 = $20.

That means Maggie has $60 - $15 = $45 left, and Riza has $60 - $20 = $40 left.

Together they have $45 + $40 = $85 left.


85 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Monkey 1 eats 10 bananas a day.
* Monkey 2 eats 14 bananas a day (10 + 4).
* Together, that's 24 bananas a day for those two monkeys.
* Mr. Robles has enough bananas to feed them for a week, so that's 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day total.
* That means Monkey 3 eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.


21 

"
"Okay, so Teddy did half of the first puzzle, which is 500 / 2 = 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's another 500 pieces.  In total, he put together 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.


750 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses, which is one dozen and 3 extra. A dozen roses cost $15, and 3 roses cost $6 (3 x $2). That's a total of $21.

She pays with $25, so her change is $4. Since they only have quarters, she gets $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.


16 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, so that's 6 * $5.50 = $33.00
* He sells 9 burger platters at $11 each, so that's 9 * $11 = $99.00
* He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, so that's 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, to find his total earnings, we add up all the money: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00


162.00 

"
"Okay, so Paul's train is the fourth one to arrive.  Let's figure out when that is:

* The first train gets there in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes.
* The second train shows up 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes.
* The second train only stays for 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
* The third train arrives an hour after the second one leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes.
* The third train leaves right away, and the fourth one comes 20 minutes later, so that's 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.


Paul has to wait for 145 minutes. 

145 

"
"Okay, so Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and she already has 120. That means she needs 80 more. Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 8 more weeks to get enough. 


8 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, so 120% of $1500 is $1800.  That means his friend saved $200 compared to the original price. To find the percentage discount, we divide the savings by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so if one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's 3600 jellyfish in an hour.  If you have 5 springs, they'd make 5 times that, so 18000 jellyfish per hour.  Over 4 hours, that's 18000 times 4, which is 72000 jellyfish.


72000 

"
"Okay, so Frankie's score was twice Binkie's score plus 15.  

Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.

Adding 15 to that gives us 180 + 15 = 195.


195 

"
"Okay, so James walks 2 miles to the halfway point. Then he has to walk 2 miles back home. That's 4 miles total already.  Then he walks another 2 miles to the store. So he walks 6 miles in all.

Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it takes him 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours to get to the store.


1.5 

"
"Okay, so Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas in each bunch, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought them individually, it would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

Since she bought them in bunches, it cost 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence total. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, which means we need to figure out how much Sam gets.  

Let's think of it like this: if we take away the extra 60 feet Harry gets, they'd have an equal amount. That means they'd each have 100 feet / 2 = 50 feet.

Since Harry gets 60 feet *more*, Sam gets 50 feet - 60 feet = -10 feet.  

Wait, that doesn't make sense! You can't have negative fence. This problem doesn't seem to work out right. 



"
"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  That means it grows 2 inches each year (8 / 4 = 2).

If it grows 2 inches a year, in 13 years it will grow 26 inches (2 * 13 = 26).


26 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

*  Marcel sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.
* BMX bikes are half the price of MTBs, which cost $500, so BMX bikes cost $500 / 2 = $250 each.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes, earning 45 * $250 = $11,250.
* That leaves 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.
*  Those MTBs brought in 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding up all the earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


$131,250
"
"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales every hour for 6 hours, that's 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That means there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left in the field.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has 8 classes a day since he takes 2 extra. That's 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes of class each day.

Over a week, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

He spends another 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes each day on the weekend studying, so that's 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

In total, he studies 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes a week.

That's 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours a week.


30 

"
"Okay, so the ball starts at 72 feet up (3 floors * 24 feet per floor).  After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that, which is 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up 2/3 of 48 feet, which is 32 feet.


32 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child who is 6 feet tall, so the second child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.
* The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, making them 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.
* Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so they are 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.


72 

"
"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples. That means they sold 2000 / 10 = 200 bags.

If each bag costs $5, then they made 200 * $5 = $1000.


$1000 

"
"Okay, so the Allosaurus ate what was left after the velociraptors got their share. That means the 270 kg of meat the Allosaurus ate was half of what was left. So, before the velociraptors showed up, there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.

But remember, that 540 kg was only half of what was on the triceratops to begin with because the T-Rex ate half.  So the triceratops originally had 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat.


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to figure out how much paint he needs for his room.  

* The two big walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each one is 80 square feet (10 times 8). That's 160 square feet total for those walls.

* The smaller walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each is 40 square feet. Together they're 80 square feet.

*  That means the whole room is 240 square feet (160 + 80).

* Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so he'll need 12 gallons (240 divided by 20).

* If each gallon costs $12, then the paint will cost him $144 (12 times $12).


$144 

"
"Okay, so Ellen left 2 shaken sodas out of the 8 that are left.  That means there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend will get a shaken one.  To make that a percentage, you do (2/8) * 100% which equals 25%.


25 

"
"Okay, so the trains are going in opposite directions, which means their speeds add up.  The faster train goes 60 miles per hour, and the slower one goes 30 miles per hour (half of 60).

So, in one hour, they'd be 60 + 30 = 90 miles apart.

Over three hours, they'd be 90 miles/hour * 3 hours = 270 miles apart.


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

So, he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

In total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.

"Okay, so there were 12 buses with 35 people on each, that's 12 * 35 = 420 people. Then there were 20 cars with 3 people in each, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 people.  

In total, there were 420 + 60 = 480 people.


480 

"
"Okay, so Mike is 24. Martha is 4 years younger than him, making her 20. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30.


30 

"
"Okay, so the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet per minute. That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down.

The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you go 80 feet per minute, so that's 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The big slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a half-hour lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. That's 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes of breaks every day.

Over 5 days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300 / 60 = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times that, which is 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.  Together they ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.


16 

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she returned something for $15.00, so she had $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00 left.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00, so the discount was $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00. That means the pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were 10% off $30.00, so the discount was $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

So, her new purchases added up to $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

Finally, her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.


$113.00
"
"Okay, so a fifth of the jellyfish are big, and a third of those big ones change color. That means 6 jellyfish changing color represents a third of the big jellyfish.  

If 6 is a third, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

Since the big jellyfish are a fifth of the total, there are 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank. 

90 

"
"Okay, so Ben is twice as old as Chris, who is 4. That means Ben is 2 * 4 = 8 years old.  Caroline is three times older than Ben, so she's 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

24 

"
"Okay, so Lauren wants to retire and live on 40% of her salary, which is $40,000 a year. She wants to do this for 20 years, so she needs $40,000 x 20 = $800,000 saved up.

She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year, which is $100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000.

To get to $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.


40 

"
"Okay, so Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He cuts it into four equal pieces, so each piece is 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long.  Then he cuts each of those pieces into five smaller pieces, so each of those is 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.


5 

"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school is 100%.  To find out how many students are in the whole school, we can set up a proportion: 

40/100 = 240/x

Cross-multiplying gives us:

40x = 24000

Divide both sides by 40:

x = 600

So there are 600 students in the school.  To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys:

600 - 240 = 360


360 

"
"Okay, so she spent $19 on pots and $26 on soil, which is $19 + $26 = $45 total. Then she used a $7 coupon, so she paid $45 - $7 = $38.


$38
"
"Okay, so there are six women in total. Three have 4-inch heels and three have 2-inch heels.  To find the average, you add up all the heel heights and divide by the number of women.

So, it's (4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3 inches.


3 

"
"Okay, so Soledad wants to hike a ton of miles in June!  

She's planning to hike 250 miles each day (125 miles twice a day).  If she does that for the whole month, she'll hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

But she wants to hike 9300 miles total. That means she needs to hike 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 more miles.

To get those extra miles in, she needs to hike 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 more miles each day.


60 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 red balls at $9 each, that's 3 * 9 = $27.

Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's 11 * 5 = $55.

And finally, 25 green balls at $3 each, which is 25 * 3 = $75.

If you add all that up, they'll make $27 + $55 + $75 = $157 when they sell all the balls.


157 

"
"Okay, so they bought 12 kg of apples total. Peter takes a quarter, which is 3 kg (12 / 4 = 3). Paul takes a third, which is 4 kg (12 / 3 = 4).  That means they took 7 kg together (3 + 4 = 7).  

So James gets the rest, which is 5 kg (12 - 7 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so it started at 2 degrees. Then it got 8 degrees colder, so that's 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  

Then it warmed up 3 degrees, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.

-3 

"
"Okay, so Raymond starts with $21, then gets $11 more, so he has $21 + $11 = $32.  Then he spends $5 on a comic, leaving him with $32 - $5 = $27. After buying the puzzle for $19, he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.


$8 

"
"Okay, so Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12.  Then she had $2 left, meaning she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on books. Since she bought two books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.


$5 

"
"Okay, so there was a 20% increase from last year.  That means we need to find out what 20% of 50 is, and then add that to 50.

20% of 50 is (20/100) * 50 = 10 students.

So this year there are 50 + 10 = 60 students.


60 

"
"Okay, so the lighthouse blinks 255 times every 5 minutes. That means it blinks 51 times each minute (255 divided by 5).  To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we divide the total blinks by the blinks per minute: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.


9 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Tate starts with 7 male fish and 12 female fish. Then he adds 4 more male fish and 4 more female fish.  That means he has 11 male fish (7 + 4) and 16 female fish (12 + 4).

To find the difference, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish: 16 - 11 = 5.


5 

"
"Okay, so Amalia spent 4 hours mowing. Megan took 2 hours longer than that, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, meaning she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.

To find the total time, we add up the time each person spent: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.


18 

"
"Okay, so John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents. That means it's 70 * 2 = 140 miles each way.

Since it's a round trip, he drives 140 * 2 = 280 miles every time he visits.

He visits twice a month, so he drives 280 * 2 = 560 miles a month.


560 

"
"Okay, so Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, that's 10 * 7 = 70 miles. Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles.


35 

"
"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys total.  Let's see... four of the workers make 6 toys an hour times 10 hours, that's 60 toys each, so they make 240 toys together. The other two workers make 4 toys an hour times 10 hours, so they make 40 toys each, for a total of 80 toys. That's 240 + 80 = 320 toys from those four workers.

They need 20 more toys to finish the order, so the last worker must have made 180 toys.  That means they made 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.


18 

"
"Okay, so Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog weighs a quarter of that, which is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog weighs half as much as Kory's, so that's 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Elijah's dogs weigh a total of 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 left over, meaning they had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers to start.

Those 16 stickers were half of what Luis had, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis got those 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half his stickers. That means Seth started with 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.


64 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. That's a total of 30 ounces of M&Ms (3 x 10 = 30).

If each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has a total of 900 M&Ms (30 x 30 = 900).

Since he wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 90 small bags (900 / 10 = 90).


90 

"
"Okay, so Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  Halfway around the Earth is 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.  To figure out how many days it takes him, we divide the total distance by his daily distance: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.


50 

"
"Okay, so the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, and the second fastest is 5 times faster than a regular car.  A regular car goes 120 mph, so the second fastest goes 5 * 120 = 600 mph.  That means the fastest car goes 1.25 * 600 = 750 mph.


750 

"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, which means he was 14 two years ago.  The problem says that two years ago, Liam was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.  That means Vince is 9 now. 


9 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. That means Sarah painted 30 - 12 = 18 eggs.

* Camden painted 18 + 12 = 30 eggs.

* Arnold and Madeline painted the rest, which is 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

* Since they painted the same amount, Arnold painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

* Camden painted 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold. 


17 

"
"Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put 8 in each box. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so all the boxes together weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces total (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon).

That means the total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds. 


25 

"
"Okay, so he can use 64 feet of the tree.  Since each log is 4 feet, he can make 16 logs.  That means he gets 80 planks (16 logs * 5 planks/log).  If he sells each plank for $1.20, he makes $96 total. 


$96
"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half of what her brother makes.  That means her brother makes $5000 * 2 = $10000 a month.

Together they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000. Their mom makes twice that, so she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.


45000 

"
"Okay, so Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  We know she takes 40 minutes to walk the 2 miles on the beach.  That means she walks at 3 miles per hour on the beach (2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)).

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so she's going 6 miles per hour.  Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, that takes her 10 minutes (1 mile / 6 miles per hour).

Adding the beach time and sidewalk time, her total walk takes 50 minutes. 


50
"
"Okay, so Jane saves $4 each week.  She's already saved $32 (because 4 x 8 = 32).  She wants to have $60, so she needs to save $28 more (60 - 32 = 28).

If she saves $4 each week, it will take her 7 more weeks to reach her goal (28 / 4 = 7).


7 

"
"Okay, so there are three groups of trees.  The first group has 3 trees with 7 birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 birds. Then there are 2 trees with 4 birds each, for a total of 2 * 4 = 8 birds.  Finally, there's 1 tree with 3 birds.

Adding all those up, we get 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 birds.


32 

"
"Okay, so Bob ends up with 60 marbles after getting 2 dozen more. That means he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles to start.  If he loses 10, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.


26 

"
"Okay, so Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees.  He's got some water that's only 33 degrees, so the other water has to be pretty warm to make up for it.

He's mixing 4 ounces of the cold water with 1 ounce of the hot water.  That means the hot water is going to have a bigger impact on the final temperature.

Since the final mix has to be at least 40 degrees, the hot water has to be way warmer than that to bring the average up. I'd say the second bottle has to be at least 68 degrees. 


68
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

He starts with 50 cows and gets 20 more each day for three weeks. That's 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows.

So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

He also starts with 20 chickens and gets 10 more each day for three weeks. That's 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens.

That means he has 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, he has 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.


700 

"
"Okay, so Russell gets 4 packs of bagels at $10 each, so that's 4 * $10 = $40.  But wait, there's a 10% discount!  That's $40 * 0.10 = $4 off. So the bagels actually cost $40 - $4 = $36.

He gets 9 bagels per pack, and he bought 4 packs, meaning he has 9 * 4 = 36 bagels.

To find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36 / 36 = $1.00 per bagel. 


$1.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

It says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops. So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

That means each scoop needs 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

Gomer ate 23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops.

So, he ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.


27 

"
"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for a month, that's 3 times 30 which is 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.  In total, he eats 90 plus 150, which is 240 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he needs 240 divided by 12, which is 20 dozen eggs.


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jelly beans and twice that many red ones, which is 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans altogether.

If there are 60 jelly beans total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans. 


9
"
"Okay, so Tim gets 6 lemons from each of his 5 trees every year. That's 6 * 5 = 30 lemons per year.  

A decade is 10 years, so over a decade he'd get 30 * 10 = 300 lemons.


300 

"
"Okay, so there are 84 people on the bus, and the ratio of men to women is 5:9. That means there are 14 parts in total (5 + 9 = 14).  

Each part has 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

There were 9 parts women, so there were 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.


34 

"
"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 a day from single sunflowers and $56 a day from bouquets. That means he makes $26 + $56 = $82 a day from sunflowers.

Since each bouquet sunflower earns him $8 / 12 = $0.67, he makes $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we divide his total earnings from sunflowers by his earnings per sunflower: $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = about 30.7 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold about **30** sunflowers. 

30 

"
"Okay, so Adam starts with $100. He buys 20 rocks at $5 each, which costs him his whole $100.  He sells 60% of those, so that's 12 rocks. If he sells each rock for $7, he makes 12 * $7 = $84.

Since he spent $100 and only made $84, he loses $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Lauren has a lot of scenes to draw! 

Let's figure out how long each type will take:

* **Large scenes:** 45 scenes / 5 scenes a day = 9 days
* **Medium scenes:** 36 scenes / 6 scenes a day = 6 days
* **Small scenes:** 49 scenes / 7 scenes a day = 7 days

Now, add up the days for each type: 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days


22 

"
"Okay, so Chatty has 36 eggs (3 dozen is 3 times 12, which is 36).  Since she has 4 kids, each kid gets 36 divided by 4, which is 9 eggs.


9 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 3 fish and each one needs $1 of food every day.  That means she spends $3 each day on fish food.  May has 31 days, so she spends $3 x 31 = $93 on fish food for the whole month.


$93 

"
"Okay, so Patricia starts with 30 roses, gives 24 away, leaving her with 6. Then she buys 15 more, so she has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.


21 

"
"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to figure out the total distance he traveled and the total time it took.

That's 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles total.

And the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Average speed is distance divided by time, so 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so that's 20% * 3 = 60%.

To find the chance of both happening, you multiply the probabilities together: 20% * 60% = 12%.


12% 

"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* Jim has 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos has 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.
* Carlos has twice as many as Carrey, meaning Carrey has 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.
* Altogether, they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.
* If they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.


20 

"
"Okay, so Mason eats 4 carrots a day from Monday to Friday, which is 4 * 5 = 20 carrots.

Then on the weekend, he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.

In total, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week. 


30
"
"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than the first song, which means it's 5 minutes + (5 minutes * 0.60) = 8 minutes long.

That means the total time for the cassette is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.


13 

"
"Okay, so Linus buys each phone for $20 and sells them for double that, which is $40. That means he makes a $20 profit on each phone.

He bought 2 phones on Monday, so he made $20/phone * 2 phones = $40.

On Tuesday, he bought 4 phones and made $20/phone * 4 phones = $80.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120 profit.


120 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall. Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.


3 

"
"Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of the energy you need.  That means they're covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs right now.

We need to figure out how much more they need to make to cover 100% for 2300 people. That's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of energy total.

They're short 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% of energy.

Since each bottle is 20%, they need to make 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 bottles more.


**Answer:** 11458 

"
"Okay, so Carla has 8 babies, and 6 of them wear purple.  Of those 6, 2 wear bows.  There are also 2 babies wearing blue and bows. That means there are 4 babies total wearing bows.

So, out of the babies with bows, half of them are wearing purple. That's a 50% chance. 


50 

"
"Okay, so they got 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday combined, and then 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  That's a total of 1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports for those four days.

Since they got 5168 reports all week, they must have gotten 5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports on Wednesday.


1125 

"
"Okay, so Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. Then he sells another quarter, which is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters, for $30.  That leaves him with 40 - 10 = 30 square meters. He sells the rest for $3 per square meter, so that's 30 * $3 = $90.

Adding up all his sales, he makes $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.


$170 

"
"Okay, so Haley is 26. Half of Haley's age is 26 divided by 2, which is 13. Geb is 10 years younger than that, so Geb is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.


3
"
"Okay, so Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. That means he uses 2 * 3 = 6 masks every day.

Over two days, he'd use 6 * 2 = 12 masks.


12 

"
"Okay, so Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.  Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, meaning he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left.


9 

"
"Okay, so John's got a lot of garbage to collect! 

Let's see... the first two places have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last place is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.

That means the last place has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place 3 times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

He makes $0.40 for each collection, so he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 a week.


$1728.00
"
"Okay, so this avocado tree's fruit production is pretty interesting.

* A 6-year-old tree makes three times what a 5-year-old makes, which is 50 fruits * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old tree makes seven times the initial 50, so that's 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.
*  We know a 10-year-old tree makes 20 times the initial amount, which is 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree makes 200 less than a 10-year-old, so it makes 1000 fruits - 200 fruits = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruit from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits

"Okay, so we've got this rope problem. Let's break it down:

* The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* All three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To figure out how long the red rope is, we need to use some algebra.  

Let's say the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long. That means the red rope is 4b centimeters long, and the yellow rope is b + 7 centimeters long.

If we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms, we have:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 5

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"
"Okay, so Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Rissa gave away some money and has 4/5 of what she started with left. That means she gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 * (1/5) = $3.

Ronnie also gave away $3.  That leaves him with $5 - $3 = $2.


Answer: 2 

"
"Okay, so half the mural is yellow, which means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're all used in equal amounts, each color got 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.

Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"
"Okay, so Alice starts with 3 clouds on Monday.  Then each day she sees double the clouds from the day before.

* Tuesday: 3 * 2 = 6 clouds
* Wednesday: 6 * 2 = 12 clouds
* Thursday: 12 * 2 = 24 clouds
* Friday: 24 * 2 = 48 clouds

To find the total, we add up the clouds from each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds

"
"Okay, so the bigger box has 20% more pods, which is 20 more pods than the regular box. That means it has 120 pods total.  Since it still costs $12, you get 120 pods for $12, which means you get 10 pods for every dollar.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* He starts with $1000 and each bill is $20, so that's $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.
* He loses 10, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* He uses half for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.
* He triples his money, so now he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills (each worth $20).
* That's $20 * 60 = $1200 total.
* Finally, he changes them to $5 bills, meaning he has $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.


**Answer:** 240 

"
"Okay, so Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scored 2 less than that, so they got 2 goals.  In the second half, Team B scored 4 times the amount from the first half, which is 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of that, so they got 2 more goals.

That means Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

All together, there were 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the game.

"
"Okay, so the teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it, which is 2.25 inches (5 * 0.45 = 2.25). That means he has 2.75 inches left (5 - 2.25 = 2.75).

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 1 inch (5 * 0.20 = 1).  He can use the chalk for 2 more full days because 2.75 inches is enough for 2 days worth of use (2.75 / 1 = 2.75, but he can't use it for part of a day).

"Okay, so there are 12 girls and 12 boys, making a total of 24 students.  One-third of the girls, which is 4 girls, are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys, which is 3 boys, are also on varsity. That means 7 students are on varsity in total.  

If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of it went bad. That means 1600 gallons were bad.  Since each gallon cost $3.50, he should get a refund of 1600 * $3.50 = $5600.


$5600 

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's age now is ""w"" and Colin's age now is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can use these two facts to solve for ""c"", which is Colin's current age.

First, let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now, plug that value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
3c + 75 = 5c + 35
40 = 2c
c = 20


So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. That means each school gets $9,000 ($27,000 / 3 = $9,000).

He can buy 100 books for $500, so each book costs $5 ($500 / 100 = $5).

With $9,000 per school, he can buy 1800 books for each school ($9,000 / $5 = 1800).

"
"Okay, so Kate's friends are gonna eat a lot of pizza!  

Let's see... they're eating 6 slices of cheese each and there are 12 slices per cheese pizza, so she needs 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices of cheese pizza. That means she needs 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 cheese pizzas.

They're also eating 4 slices of pepperoni each, and each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. So, she needs 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza. That's 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"
"Okay, so John is 28 now and Digimon is 20 years old. That means John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon came out.

Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

"
"Okay, so Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than that, so she ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than his sister, meaning he ate 3 slices.

"Okay, let's figure this out.

They used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 50 + (50 - 38) = 62 bandages left at the start of the second day.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages (38 - 10), leaving them with 62 - 28 = 34 bandages.

On the third day, they got 100 more bandages (2 packs of 50) and used 25 (half a pack). That means they had 34 + 100 - 25 = 109 bandages before using any on the third day.

Since they had 78 left at the end of the third day, they must have started with 109 + 78 = 187 bandages.

April has 4 weeks, so she makes $67.50 x 4 = $270 that month.

Oh, and she gets an extra $10 for perfect attendance! So, in total, she'll get $270 + $10 = $280.

"Okay, so John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, which means each bottle costs $60. Cognac is 50% more expensive, so each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  That means he spends 20 * $90 = $1800 on cognac.

In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"
"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine. That means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day and 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

So, he planted a total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"Okay, so Amy starts with 2 palettes times 4 colors each, which is 8 colors. Then she has 3 makeup sets times 6 colors each, so that's 18 colors.  That's a total of 26 colors. Her sister takes a whole palette, so she loses 4 colors, leaving her with 22. Then she uses half the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 colors divided by 2, or 3 colors.  So she has 22 colors minus 3 colors, which is 19 colors left.

"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times his height, which is 60 * 7 = 420 inches.

The first floor is 3 times his height, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 inches.

If the whole house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, then the second floor (including the roof) is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Since the first floor is 180 inches, the roof must be 240 - 180 = 60 inches above the second floor.

"Okay, so the Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280 shells (700 * 0.40 = 280).  That leaves 420 shells (700 - 280 = 420).

The Finders got 60% of what was left, so they found 252 shells (420 * 0.60 = 252).

That means the Gogetters found the rest, which is 168 shells (420 - 252 = 168).

"Okay, so the dehumidifier takes out 1 liter of water each day on low.  If he runs it on low for 3 days, that's 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

On medium, it takes out twice as much, so that's 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day. Over 3 days, that's 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

On high, it takes out twice as much as medium, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day. Over 5 days, that's 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

In total, it took out 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"
"Okay, so John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's class, which has 120 kids. That means each of John's classes has 120 / 8 = 15 students.  Since he has two classes, that's 15 * 2 = 30 students total for John.

Adding that to Ali's 120 students, the schools together can hold 120 + 30 = 150 students.

"Okay, so this is a bit of a tricky problem.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. The jar is like a box, so we multiply the length, width, and height to get the total space: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit perfectly together, so we have to account for the spaces between them.  They said they only use about 80% of the space, so we multiply the total space by 0.80: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide the usable space by the size of one jelly bean: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Now, Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.30: 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 jelly beans.

The problem says there are actually 900 red jelly beans, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

At the next stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop get on again, which is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people.

Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 each time. That's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.

Over 5 years, she spends $6 * 5 = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 * 1.5 = $3 to the original price.

So now each visit costs $2 + $3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5 * 3 * 3 = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75.

"Let's break this down.  The board is 40 feet long, and one piece is four times longer than the other.  

Think of it like this: if we divide the board into 5 equal parts, the longer piece would take up 4 of those parts, and the shorter piece would take up 1 part.

So, each ""part"" is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is 4 parts, so it's 4 * 8 feet = 32 feet long.

"
"Okay, so Aiden needs enough meatballs for 80 people.  He gets 16 meatballs from each pound of beef, so he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

10 

"
"Okay, so Luke has five windows, and each one is 35 inches wide.  To find the total width, we multiply: 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.

Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, we multiply again: 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric. 

350 

"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, which is 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.

The rest of the call is 36 - 16 = 20 minutes. Those minutes cost $0.20 each, so that's 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.

In total, the call would cost $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

"
"Okay, so Carly needs enough cupcakes and brownies for 10 treats total (5 people * 2 treats each). Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes.  She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

That means the total number of treats is c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, so together that's $75.  They have a deal for 20% off if you do both, so that's $75 times 0.20 which is $15 off.  That makes the manicure and pedicure $60.  Nail art is $3 per nail and she wants it on all 10 fingers, so that's $30.  Adding that to the manicure and pedicure, it's $60 + $30 = $90.

"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings and Shelley has 12 more than that, which is 39 paintings.  Kim has 8 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.


31 

"
"Okay, so the toy started at $40. Then in December, it went up by 80%, which is like adding 80% of $40, which is $32. So in December it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

Then in January, it went down by 50%, which is like taking away half of $72, which is $36. So in January it cost $72 - $36 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson, and he has four of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he takes off 25% of his normal price, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20.  So he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

He has two veteran lessons, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

In total, he makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.


$440 

"
"Okay, to find Sally's average quiz score, you add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes.

So, 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Then, 630 divided by 9 quizzes equals 70.


70 

"
"Okay, so Eve started with 20 pomelos. She has 1/4 of that left, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos.  That means she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.


15 

"
"Okay, so Walter starts with 60 apples. He eats 24 of them (that's 2/5 of 60).  That leaves him with 36 apples. Then he gives his sister 9 apples (25% of 36).  He has 27 apples left.

If he sells each of those apples for $3, he makes 27 * $3 = $81.


$81 

"
"Okay, so Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's three-quarters of the novels she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we can set up a little equation.

If 3/4 of this year's novels is 9, then we can think of it like this:

(3/4) * (total novels this year) = 9

To find the total, we can divide both sides by 3/4, which is the same as multiplying by 4/3:

(total novels this year) = 9 * (4/3) = 12


12
"
"Okay, so Michael drives for 3 days at 50 km/hr. That's 50 times 24 hours a day, which is 1200 km per day.  Over 3 days, he covers 1200 times 3, which is 3600 km.

The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, so he's covered 3600 out of 6000 km. To find the percentage, we do (3600 / 6000) times 100, which equals 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice.

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies (4 pies * 12 grapes/pie = 48 grapes).

To find out how many grapes they started with, we add the grapes used for juice and pies: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 82 teachers, but 13 were out sick. That means 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were there.  They also had 9 substitute teachers, so in total there were 69 + 9 = 78 teachers at school.


78 

"
"Okay, so Bud makes mac and cheese every week.  Let's see... pasta is a dollar, cheddar is three dollars, and gruyere is double the cheddar, so that's six dollars.  That means each week he spends 1 + 3 + 6 = $10.00.

In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he spends 10 * 52 = $520.00 on mac and cheese.


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 80 classrooms to clean and it takes 15 minutes per room, that's 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes total.

To find the percentage, we do (1200 / 2400) * 100% = 50%.

So they spend 50% of their day cleaning. 


50
"
"Okay, so Elly's middle shelves hold 10 books each, and she has two of those, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 books. The bottom shelf holds double that, so it holds 20 * 2 = 40 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 40 - 5 = 35 books.

That means each bookcase can hold 20 + 40 + 35 = 95 books. Since she has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 95 = 1.16 bookcases.  Since she can't have part of a bookcase, she'll need 2 bookcases to fit all her books. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Rose spent $2.40 for each dozen eggs, and she bought 5 dozen, so that's $2.40 x 5 = $12.00 total.

She's selling them in groups of 3 for $1.00, and she has 60 eggs (5 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen).  That means she can make 60 / 3 = 20 groups of eggs.

If she sells all the groups, she'll make 20 x $1.00 = $20.00.

Her profit is the money she makes minus what she spent, so $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so half of Skyler's hats are red, which is 100 / 2 = 50 hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.  

Then, 3/5 of those are blue, so that's (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means he has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.


20 

"
"Okay, so the jerky is $18 a bag, but it's on sale for $3 off.  That means it costs $15.  There are 30 sticks in a bag, so each stick costs $15 divided by 30, which is $0.50.  To get the price in cents, we multiply by 100, so each stick costs 50 cents. 

50 

"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right. That means she needs to get 77 questions right (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

To move on, she needs to get 35 more questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).


35 

"
"Let 's' be the number of strawberry cubes. She makes 5 times that amount of blueberry cubes minus 4, so that's 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

In total, she makes s + (5s - 4) = 116 cubes.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides, we have 6s = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20 strawberry cubes.

Finally, she makes 5(20) - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes. 


96
"
"Okay, so Ara plays 40 games a year and scores 21 points each game. Over four years, she's played 40 * 4 = 160 games.

That means she's scored a total of 160 * 21 = 3360 points.


3360 

"
"Okay, so Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half, which is 5. He found 3 of them, so he had 3 marbles. Then he lost one because it was a bead, leaving him with 2 marbles. 


2
"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  He gets one person to come to the dealership for every 25 calls he makes. Then, for every two people who come in, one buys a car.

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars. That means he needs 30 people to come to the dealership (15 customers x 2 people per customer = 30 people).

To get 30 people to come in, he needs to make 750 phone calls (30 people x 25 calls per person = 750 calls).


750 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. They have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  

Half the rooms have small candles, so that's 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms. They have 4 small candles per room, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have medium candles, so that's another 4 rooms. They have 5 medium candles per room, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

In total, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Adding the flashlights, they have a total of 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40 candles and flashlights. 


40
"
"Okay, so Mitchell has 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so that's 2 * 55 = 110 chips total.  Since there are 5 people in his family, each person gets 110 / 5 = 22 chips.


22 

"
"Okay, so it takes him 5 minutes for the first side.  Then the next two sides take twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each, for a total of 20 minutes. The last two sides take half the time of the first, which is 2.5 minutes each, for a total of 5 minutes.

Adding it all up: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes. 


30 

"
"Okay, so there were 20 helmets.  He saw half as many robots, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were twice as many footballs as helmets, meaning there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Adding them all up, he saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items. 

70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes. If each call takes 15 minutes, he can do 360 / 15 = 24 calls a day.  Over a 5 day week, that's 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.


120 

"
"Okay, so the old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, and she's doing 6 paintings, so that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it's 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

That means it takes 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer with the new varnish.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The plants needing half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups total.
* The plants needing a full cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups total.
* That leaves 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants that need a quarter cup each.
* Those 8 plants need 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups total.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water.


12
"
"Okay, so Phineas has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

He hops at 20 yards a minute, so that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming is slower, at 10 yards a minute, so that's 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those times together, it takes him 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.


15 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8.  That means he'll need to buy 7 boxes (56 / 8 = 7). Since each box costs $2.00, it'll cost him $14.00 to buy all the popsicle sticks. 


$14.00 

"
"Okay, so the main phone is $20.  Each of the other phones costs half that, which is $10. Since there are four extra phones, that's $10 x 4 = $40.  

Adding the main phone's cost, the whole plan is $20 + $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.

He sells each one for $2, so he makes 120 * $2 = $240 every day.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 * 30 = $7200 in the whole month.


$7200 

"
"Okay, so Jade takes 210 photos and uploads 7 at a time, 6 times a day.  That means she uploads 7 * 6 = 42 photos each day.

To find out how many days it takes to upload all her photos, we divide the total photos by the number she uploads daily: 210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days.


5 

"
"Okay, so Alicia spends $5 on each blouse, and she has 5 blouses, so that's 5 * $5 = $25. Her pants cost $8 each, and she has 2 pairs, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.  The skirt is $6.  

So each week she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47 on dry cleaning.

Over 5 weeks, that would be $47 * 5 = $235. 


$235.00 

"
"Okay, so John's new speed is 375 words per minute because 150 times 2.5 is 375.  He has to say 4500 words total (10 pages times 450 words per page).  

If he says 375 words every minute, it will take him 12 minutes to say all the words (4500 divided by 375).


12 

"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day. Then 20 more showed up the next day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, there were twice as many as the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the people he saw each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.


500 

"
"Okay, so Garrett's popcorn popping is getting crazy!

* First 30 seconds: 20 kernels pop.
* Next 30 seconds: That's three times the first amount, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels.
* Next 30 seconds: Four times the first amount, so 20 * 4 = 80 kernels.
* Last 30 seconds: Half the amount from the last 30 seconds, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
* After he takes it off the heat, another 40 / 4 = 10 kernels pop.

Let's add it all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels!

210 

"
"Okay, so Tim needs enough lemons for 5 gallons of lemonade total.  He needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, and 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice.

That means he needs 5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.


30 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 German Shepherds that eat 5 kg each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 kg of food a day just for them. Then the 2 Bulldogs eat 3 kg each, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 kg more.  

That means they need 15 + 6 = 21 kg of food every day.

Over a whole week, that's 21 * 7 = 147 kg.


147 

"
"Okay, so we've got 10 animals with 2 legs each, that's 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Then there are 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 legs.  

Adding those together, there are a total of 20 + 60 = 80 legs on the farm.


80 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, which is 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks total. Since there are 32 blocks in all, there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks.


20 

"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, which means he goes 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  Since he's driving east, he's heading back towards his house.  That means he's 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his house.


54 

"
"Okay, so the boat loses 30% of its value the first year, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300 after the first year.

The second year it loses another 30%, so that's $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  Now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, the third year it loses 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  After three years, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.


$3528
"
"Okay, so there are 232 candies in total.  There are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange, so that's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow as red, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

That means there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.

To find out how many are pink, we subtract that number from the total: 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.


43 

"
"Okay, so Helen's hotel cost $80 per night and she stayed for 3 nights, so that's $80 * 3 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8. She took the bus 7 times, so that's $8 * 7 = $56.

In total, she spent $240 + $56 = $296 on the hotel and bus.


296 

"
"Okay, so Mazie started with 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21, but he lost 4, meaning he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles to begin with.  That means Darla got 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.


27 

"
"Okay, so they need two adult tickets at $12 each, which is $24. Then there's one child ticket for $8.  Popcorn is $3 each, and they get two, so that's $6.  

Let me add that all up: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.


38 

"
"Okay, so the car weighs 1200 pounds, the stuff inside weighs 250 pounds, and his kids weigh 75 pounds each, so that's another 150 pounds.  That means everything together weighs 1600 pounds.

To find out how much force he needs, we need to find 1% of that.  So, 1600 times 0.01 is 16 pounds.


16 

"
"Okay, so James needs enough crepe paper to go all the way around his fence.  That means we need to find the perimeter.  

The fence is a rectangle, so we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

The length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, so:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet
Perimeter = 70 feet


70 

"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and her older sister Emma is 16 years older. That means Emma is 56.  To find their average age, you add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 because there are two of them. 96 divided by 2 is 48.


48 

"
"Okay, so they found a bunch of seashells, but some were cracked.  Let's see...

* They found 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells total.
* Then they had to take out the 67 cracked ones.
* That leaves them with 732 - 67 = 665 good seashells.


665 

"
"Okay, so Avery needs a plate setting for each of her 12 guests.  Each setting has a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

Dinner plates are $6 each, salad plates are $4 each, and bowls are $5 each.

So, one place setting costs $6 + $4 + $5 = $15.

Since she needs 12 settings, the total cost is $15 x 12 = $180.00 


$180.00
"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours. Half of that is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.  Anna took 2 hours longer than that, so she took 5 + 2 = 7 hours.


7 

"
"Okay, so Dexter has 5 pigs and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. That's 8 pounds per pig every day.  Since he has 5 pigs, that's 40 pounds of feed a day total. Over a week, that's 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds.

If he started with 300 pounds, he'd have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.


20 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people eating 2 each, which is 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 36 more.  Since each pack has 6 hot dogs, he'll need 6 packs.  If each pack costs $2, that's 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Frances makes $40 from the cupcakes and another $40 from the cookies, for a total of $80.  The trays cost her $20, so she has $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 kids at the start. Then each kid gets a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.  On the third street, each of those 10 kids brings two more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids leave, so we take away 5 from 20. That leaves us with 15 kids.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mamou started with 1360 meals.  She gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 

1218 

"
"Okay, let's see... a quarter is worth 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  

Adding those up, James has 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents. 

105 

"
"Okay, so there are two brothers. One is 12, and the other is twice that age, which is 24.  There are three sisters who are all 16.

To find the total age, we add up everyone's age: 12 + 24 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 84


84 

"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day, and that's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for an hour, five days a week, so that's another 300 minutes.  That means she does a total of 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, that's 2040 minutes.


2040 

"
"Okay, so Octavia's quilt is made of different sized t-shirts.  

* The small ones are 3 square feet each, and she's using 11 of those, so that's 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.
* The medium shirts are 4 square feet each, and she has 8, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.
* The large shirts are 6 square feet each, and she's using 6, for a total of 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

To find the total size of the quilt, we add up all the pieces: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.


101 

"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more than that, so it has 36 * 0.50 = 18 extra seeds. That means a large sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.  

In total, there are 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.


90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that amount, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.


27
"
"Okay, so Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches tall. That means Anne is 36 * 2 = 72 inches tall.

Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.

Since she grew 3 inches over the summer, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make $10,000 every day.  

In a week, that's $10,000 times 7, which is $70,000.

Over two weeks, they'd make $70,000 times 2, so $140,000.


$140000 

"
"Okay, so Jake gets a deal on the T-shirts.  One is full price, and the other is half off, so the two shirts cost $8 + ($8 / 2) = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

In total, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.


$36
"
"Okay, so Ryan makes $6 a week for doing his chores and he did them for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18. Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 4 friends (including himself) for ice cream, which is $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.


2 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spent $100 on leggings plus $5 on a frame, which is $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 each on two bathrobes, so that's $30 + $200 = $230.  

Adding their spending together, they spent $105 + $230 = $335 in total.


$335 

"
"Okay, so Tim's making this cool honey and jam mix.  

Let's see... he uses 2 pounds of passion fruit at $6 a pound, so that's 2 * $6 = $12. Then he uses 1.5 pounds of jackfruit at $8 a pound, which is 1.5 * $8 = $12. And he needs 2 pounds of honey at $10 a pound, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.

That means each jar costs him $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 to make.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of $50 - $44 = $6 per jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes a total profit of $6 * 10 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Quarters: 32 quarters are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00
* Dimes: 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
* Nickels: 120 nickels are worth 120 * $0.05 = $6.00
* Pennies: 750 pennies are worth 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Adding those all up: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00


$31.00

"Okay, let's figure this out.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 per ticket for two movie tickets (so $7.50 x 2 = $15.00), and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00
"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week and fixes 3 cars each day. That means he works on 15 cars every week (5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars).

He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 each week (15 cars * $4/car = $60).

Over two weeks, he'd make $120 ( $60/week * 2 weeks = $120).


$120 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Randy starts with 18 cookies (9 + 4 + 5). He eats 3, then 2 more oatmeal cookies, so he's down to 12 (18 - 3 - 2 = 13).  He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 10 (13 - 2 = 11). Finally, he bakes 12 more cookies (4 of each type), bringing his total to 24 (11 + 12 = 24).

"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  If he sells half at $5 each, that's 6 toys * $5 = $30. The other half he sells for $7 each, so that's 6 toys * $7 = $42.  

If he adds those together, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.


72 

"
"Okay, so the dog digs a ton of holes! 6 holes a day for 14 days is 84 holes total.  

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really only filling 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).

That's 4 weeks (28 / 7 = 4).

"
"Okay, so Butler High has 3/4 the number of students as Norman High. That means they have (3/4) * 4000 = 3000 students.

Norman High has 4000 - 3000 = 1000 more students than Butler High.


1000 

"
"Okay, so they made 7995 cookies total, and we know 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  To find out how many were chocolate chip, we just add those two types together and subtract from the total:

2595 + 3075 = 5670

7995 - 5670 = 2325

They made 2325 chocolate chip cookies. 


2325
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half, so that's 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

Igor got 2 more Petri dishes than asked for, so he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

That means Igor was supposed to have 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 things in total.

But he only put 29 things on the bench, so he lost 37 - 29 = 8 things.

Since he got the right number of beakers, he must have lost 8 - (16 - 8) = 0 beakers.

"
"Okay, so James needs screws for 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws.  That means he needs 4 * 4 * 2 = 32 screws. Since he has 40 screws, he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.


8 

"
"Okay, so the second basket has twice the eggs of the first basket, which means it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.  

To find the total, we just add the number of eggs in each basket: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra's $430, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah's $300, meaning she raised $300 + $400 = $700.
* To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180


2180 

"
"Okay, so Vanessa ran 4 miles.  Aaron ran half the distance because he's twice as fast.  That means Aaron ran 2 miles.

We know Aaron finished in 16 minutes, so he ran 1 mile in 8 minutes (16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile).

Since Vanessa is half as fast as Aaron, she takes twice as long to run a mile, meaning she runs a mile in 16 minutes.

If Vanessa runs a mile in 16 minutes, then for 4 miles it would take her 64 minutes (16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes).


64 

"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line total.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.


594 

"
"Okay, so they get 6 groups each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they make $90 x 2 = $180 a week.


$180 

"
"Okay, so the vendor bought the watermelons for $80 and made a 25% profit. That means he made an extra $20 ($80 x 0.25 = $20).

So, he sold all the watermelons for $100 ($80 + $20 = $100).  Since he sold 50 watermelons, each one cost $2 ($100 / 50 = $2).


$2 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Dora is turning 12 in 3 years, so she's 9 now. James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's 37 now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is 5 years old. In 3 years, he'll be 8.

"
"Okay, so Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes and Jane takes 4 minutes.  That means in an hour, Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges. Jane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

So Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"
"Okay, so the radiator was originally $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off.  That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour and it took 3 hours, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

In total, he paid $80 + $150 = $230.


$230 

"
"Okay, so we know Farmer Brown has 20 animals total, and they have 70 legs altogether.  Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.

Let's think about it this way: if *all* the animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 animals x 2 legs/animal). That's way less than 70 legs.

This means some of the animals must be cows.  Since cows have more legs, each cow we swap in for a chicken adds 2 more legs to the total.

We need to figure out how many cows we need to add to get to 70 legs.  Let me try a few things out... 

Hmm, if we have 10 cows (40 legs) and 10 chickens (20 legs), that's 60 legs total.  We need 10 more legs, so let's add 5 more cows (20 more legs).

That gives us 15 cows and 5 chickens!

"
"Okay, so they have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, that's 7 * 8 = 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people, they each get 56 / 4 = 14 slices.
