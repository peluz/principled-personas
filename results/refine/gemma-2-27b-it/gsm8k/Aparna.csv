"Hey there!  Flipping houses can be tricky, but it sounds like Josh did a great job! 

Here's how to figure out his profit:

*  The house increased in value by 150% of its original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.
*  That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
*  His total investment was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.
*  So, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

* Since every second glass is 60% off, Kylar will pay full price for 8 glasses and a discounted price for the other 8.
* The discounted price is $5 * 0.60 = $3.
* The total cost of the full-priced glasses is 8 * $5 = $40.
* The total cost of the discounted glasses is 8 * $3 = $24.
* Adding those together, Kylar will pay $40 + $24 = $64 for all 16 glasses.

"Okay, let's break this down.

Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute.  Since she needs to download 200 GB, that would normally take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes.

But, the restart throws a wrench in things! She loses 80 GB of progress (40% of 200 GB) after 40 minutes.  

That means she has to download the full 200 GB again, which takes another 100 minutes.

Adding up the initial 40 minutes, the 20-minute restart, and the full download time, the total time is 40 + 20 + 100 = 160 minutes.

"Let's break this down.  If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more.  

Think of it like this:

* She sold 1/3 at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That means she sold half of what was left at the orange house.

To figure out how many she started with, we need to work backwards.  

Let's say she started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

* After the orange house, she had 5 left, which is half of what she had before. That means she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house.

* Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

* Before the green house, she had 12 * 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners.



So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners. 

**Answer:** 36

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. If 20% of the students are doing contemporary, that's 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students. That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students are into jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are doing hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we do (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

Think of the ratio like splitting 162 into 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18). Each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Let's break this down!

If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She would then have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has a total of 110 coins, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30:

40 + 30 = 70

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how many bags of food Cecilia needs.

* First, she needs 1 cup a day for 180 days, so that's 180 cups.
* For the rest of the year (365 days - 180 days = 185 days), she needs 2 cups a day, totaling 370 cups.
* Altogether, that's 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

In total, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270. Since she spent $100 on the 2x4s and $80 on the 4x4s, her total profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Let's break down this salary problem step by step.

First, we know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. Since Adrien was making $40,000 then, we can figure out Lylah's salary.

If Adrien's salary represents 130% (100% + 30%) of Lylah's, we can set up a proportion:

1.3x = $40,000

Solving for x (Lylah's salary), we get:

x = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately)

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40% over those four years, which is an increase of $16,000 ($40,000 * 0.40).  

So, Adrien's current salary is $56,000 ($40,000 + $16,000).

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, which is $12,307.69 ($30,769.23 * 0.40).

Her current salary is $43,076.92 ($30,769.23 + $12,307.69).

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add their individual salaries:

$56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Carl has 60 cookies in total (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack).  That means the cookies cost $6.00 (60 cookies * $0.10/cookie). If he pays with a $10 bill, his change is $4.00 ($10.00 - $6.00).

"Let's work backward to figure this out!

*  There were 5 fries left at the end, and the ants took 1, so there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries before the ants, meaning 6 fries represent one-third. So, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.
* The pigeons ate 9 fries, so there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before the pigeons.
* The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and together they ate 27 fries. This means Dave ate 27 * 2 = 54 fries.

So, there were originally 54 fries in the pack.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how long all those yummy baked goods are.

* **Rolls:** 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* **Croissants:** 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* **Baguettes:** 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add them all up: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"Hey there!  Let's break this problem down.

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age.  

In two years, they'll both be older. Seth will be 2 times Brooke's age plus 2 years, and Brooke will be her current age plus 2 years.  

We know that in two years, their ages added together will equal 28. So, we can set up an equation:

(2 * Brooke's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

Let's solve for Brooke's age:

3 * Brooke's age + 4 = 28
3 * Brooke's age = 24
Brooke's age = 8

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Adding that to her minimum payments gives us her total monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, we need an even number on the first roll (3 out of 6 chances) AND another even number on the second roll (again, 3 out of 6). So that's (3/6) * (3/6) = 1/4, or 25%.

The difference between these probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees).  But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

That means he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 100 - 20 = 130).  

Unfortunately, 30% of those trees die, which is 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).

So, Tom has 91 trees left (130 - 39 = 91).

"Let's break this problem down.  

Since both pools are losing water at the same rate, the difference in their water levels is changing because of the initial difference in their amounts.

Let's say the small pool currently has 'S' gallons of water. This means the big pool has '4S' gallons.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool, meaning it had '2(S + 16)' gallons.

We know the big pool lost 16 gallons in those four minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes).

So, we can set up an equation: 4S - 16 = 2(S + 16)

Simplifying the equation: 4S - 16 = 2S + 32

Combining like terms: 2S = 48

Solving for S: S = 24

Therefore, the small pool currently has 24 gallons of water.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out John's yearly driving costs.

He drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back). That's 300 miles a week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week) and a whopping 15,000 miles a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

At $2 per mile, his mileage cost is $30,000 (15,000 miles * $2/mile).  Don't forget the $150 monthly bonus for his driver, which adds up to $1,800 per year ($150/month * 12 months/year).

* Etching adds 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  The total etching cost is 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords cost $12 each, for a total of 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding all those costs together: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"Hi there!  

To figure out Karan's monthly payment, we need to calculate the total amount she'll repay and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's find the total interest:

* Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Now, add the interest to the original loan amount:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months:

* Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
* Monthly payment = $5475 / 5 = $1095


Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

"Let's break this down. We know each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one.  

If we think of the humps as a separate count, we have 304 humps in total.  

Let's say there are 'd' dromedaries. Since they each have one hump, that's 'd' humps from the dromedaries.

The rest of the humps must come from the camels. Since camels have two humps each, the number of camel humps is twice the number of camels.

We also know there are 180 animals in total.

This gives us two equations:

*  d + c = 180 (total animals)
*  d + 2c = 304 (total humps)

We can solve these equations to find 'd', the number of dromedaries.

Solving for 'd', we get 56.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out this salesman's profit.

First, he made $340 from the flash sale (17 sneakers * $20/sneaker). Then, he sold the rest to the department store for $775 (31 sneakers * $25/sneaker).  That means he made a total of $1115 ($340 + $775).

Since he spent $576 on the sneakers, his profit is $539 ($1115 - $576).

"Let's break it down:

The super ticket costs $21, and you saved $2 by not buying it. That means the regular price for the ticket, popcorn, and soda together was $21 - $2 = $19.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much potting soil Bob needs.

Each raised bed holds 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he has 10 beds, that's a total of 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet of soil.

Each bag covers 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

At $12 per bag, the total cost will be 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

* Carrots are only 4 bags at 12 pounds each, so that's 48 pounds.
* And just a couple of pounds of sugar cubes.

Adding it all up: 3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 pounds of feed.

"Okay, let's figure out the cost of Tom's anniversary trip. 

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day rate because it's a busy weekend. That means the hotel costs $1500 + (0.20 * $1500) = $1800 per day.

Over three days, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so for two people, they'll be $5000 * 2 = $10000.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the three friends found a total of 43 insects.  

* Bodhi found the most, and David found half as many as Bodhi.
* Lily found 7 more than David.

To figure out how many Lily found, we need to work backwards. Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half of that, so David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

Now, we know that B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get 2B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have 2B = 36

Dividing both sides by 2, we find B = 18. This means Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half of that, so David found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Finally, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

If the bottle lasts for 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, then using 1 pump per wash will make the bottle last for 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes.

That means each wash costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40.

Since Jackie uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 40 cents.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Joe's got $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35.  That's a total of $60 before the sale.  

Since everything is 30% off, the shirt will cost $25 - ($25 x 0.30) = $17.50. The shorts will cost $35 - ($35 x 0.30) = $24.50.

That means his total will be $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Joe will have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left over.

"Okay, let's calculate the total cost of John's research.

The initial funding covers 5 months at $100,000 per month, totaling $500,000.  

The research extends to 50 months, meaning there are 45 months with the increased funding. Each of those months costs 50% more, bringing the monthly cost to $150,000.

The total cost for those 45 months is $6,750,000.

Adding the initial funding and the increased funding period, the total research cost is $7,250,000.

Next, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, to get her speed per hour, we multiply: 0.02 Mb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

"Let's break this down.  We know the twins and triplets' ages add up to 44.  Since one twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets, we can think of it like this:

* **Triplets:**  Let's say each triplet is 'r' years old.
* **Twins:** One twin is 'r + 7' years old, and the other twin is 'r + 7' years old as well.

So, the total age equation is:  r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

Combining like terms: 5r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: r = 6

This means each triplet is 6 years old.  

One twin is 7 years older than a triplet, so that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before the check, the bill is $40.

The heartworm check costs $40 * 0.60 = $24.

*  If 60% of those remaining people like horse #7, that's 24 people (60/100 * 40 = 24).

*  That means 16 people must like horse #12 (40 - 24 = 16).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Jayden needs $200 for the camera. He has $70 and Ava gave him $45, so together that's $70 + $45 = $115.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can set up a little equation. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. That means the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so it needs x cases.

Adding those together: x/2 + x + x = 250

That simplifies to 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mike's digital movie collection will cost.

* First, we need to find out how many movies are in series: 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.
* Since he gets a discount on series, those will cost 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.
* That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in a series.
* Of those, 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies are older and cost $5 each, for a total of 160 movies * $5 = $800.
* The rest, 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies, are newer and cost the full $10 each, totaling 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

If we let the zest be represented by 1 part, then the fragrance is also 1 part. The salt would be 2 parts (twice the zest), the sugar is also 2 parts, and the oil is 4 parts (twice the salt).

If we add up all their cards, we get x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we have 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329

If I'm three years younger than my brother and two years older than my sister, and all our ages add up to 87, we can figure this out!

Let's say my age is ""x"". My brother is ""x + 3"" and my sister is ""x - 2"". Mom's age is tricky - it's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's 3(x + 3) - 1.

Adding everyone up: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Simplifying that: 7x + 11 = 87

Subtracting 11 from both sides: 7x = 76

Dividing both sides by 7: x = 10.86

Since you can't be part of a year old, I'm rounding that to 11.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many hours Bruce worked.

* On Wednesday, he worked twice as long as Tuesday, so that's 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.

"Let's break this down.  

We know the three ages add up to 100.  Paul is older than John by 10 years, and Peter's age is the total of Paul's and John's ages.

Think of it like this: if we combine Paul and John's ages, we get Peter's age.  So, Peter's age plus the combined age of Paul and John must equal 100.

Since Peter's age *is* the combined age of Paul and John, we can say:

Peter's age + Peter's age = 100

That means Peter's age is 100 / 2 = 50.

First, they have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 boxes.

Adding the boxes they already have, they have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table holds 2 boxes, they'll need 60 / 2 = 30 tables.

"Let's break down the widget production:

The Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets every hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a whole month (30 days), it'd produce 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, meaning it produces 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets daily. Over a month, that's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 would bring in 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32400 * $6 = $194400.

The difference in earnings is $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Jessica saves 25% of her $2,000 monthly salary, she puts aside $500 each month for shoes. Over a year, that's $500/month * 12 months = $6,000. Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, she can buy 6 pairs of shoes.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Emily needs to peel 90 shrimp, and she can do 6 per minute, so that'll take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.

Then she has to cook them. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp, it'll take her (90 / 30) * 10 = 30 minutes.

In total, it will take her 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

"Let's break down the cooling:

* On low, the AC cools the room by 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 degrees cooler.
* Then on high, it cools another 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, meaning another 3 * 4 = 12 degrees cooler.
* That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.
* But the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour for the 2 hours the AC is off, so it warms up by 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

So, the final temperature is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it started.

"Let's break this down.  The first plane flies to Greece for 3/4 of its trips, and the rest are split between France and Germany.  Since the second plane makes half as many trips as the first, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips. That means 88 * (3/4) = 66 trips are to Greece.  The remaining 88 - 66 = 22 trips are split evenly, so the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

* Altogether, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
*  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, their total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

The total age of all four children is 20. We know Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, and Helene is twice the average age of the group.  

Since there are four children, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years old. This means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

Adding up Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene's ages, we get 3 + 4 + 10 = 17 years.

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the other children's ages from the total age: 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much more water they need.

Wanda pumped a quarter of the tank on the first day, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped three-quarters of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped two-thirds of her first day's amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped one-third of her first day's amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On the second day, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

Over both days, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

"Hey there! This sounds like a tricky power bank problem. Let's break it down.

Since the power bank lost 9% per hour for 5 hours and then 7% per hour for 3 hours, that's a total loss of 45% + 21% = 66% of its charge.

That means 34% of the charge remained after those losses.  We know it ended up at 28%, so her friends must have used 6% of the power bank's charge (34% - 28% = 6%).

Think of it this way: that 6% they used was part of the 34% that was left after the initial losses.  So, if 6% represents a portion of 34%, we can figure out what 100% (the original charge) would be.

Doing a little math, we find that the original charge was about 17.65%.

"Let's break this down. If Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, and together they took 98 minutes, we can figure out how long each person cooked.

Let's say Donovan cooked for 'x' minutes. Betsy cooked for 'x + 18' minutes.

Together, that's x + (x + 18) = 98 minutes.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.

So, Donovan cooked for 40 minutes. Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds.

"Okay, let's break this down. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach, so we can figure out her beach speed.  

She walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, which means her beach speed is 2 miles / (40 minutes / 60 minutes per hour) = 3 miles per hour.

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so her sidewalk speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

It takes her 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour to walk on the sidewalk.

Converting that to minutes, we get (1/6 hour) * (60 minutes per hour) = 10 minutes.

Adding up the time on the beach and the sidewalk, her total walk time is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, the farm will have a total of 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows and 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

If the ratio of men to women is 5:9, that means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"Let's break down Faraday's sunflower sales:

* He makes $26 a day from single sunflowers and $56 a day from bouquets.
* Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he makes $56 / 12 = $4.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.
* That means he makes a total of $2 + $4.67 = $6.67 per sunflower each day.
* Over 3 days, he earns $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01 per sunflower.
* Since he made $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days, he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold **12** sunflowers after 3 days.

"Hi there! This sounds like a classic production scaling problem.  

Let's see... 2300 people need 100% of their daily energy, which is 2300 times the energy one person needs.  Currently, Hortex provides 20% of a person's daily energy per bottle, and they make 4200 bottles a day. That means they're covering 4200 bottles * 20% = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

To figure out how much more they need to produce, we need to find the difference between the total energy needed and the energy they're currently providing. That's 230000% - 84000% = 146000%.

Since each bottle covers 20%, they need to produce 146000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

* A 7-year-old tree produces seven times the fruit of a 5-year-old, meaning 50 fruits * 7 = 350 fruits.
* An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fewer fruits than a 10-year-old.
* A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the fruit of a 5-year-old, so that's 50 fruits * 20 = 1000 fruits.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can figure out the length of the red rope.

Here's how:

* Let's say the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'y - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it 4 * (y - 7) centimeters long.

Now, if we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'y':

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37
6y - 35 = 37
6y = 72
y = 12

So, the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

Now we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope = 4 * (y - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.

* On day 2, they used 28 bandages (38 - 10).
* On day 3, they used 25 bandages (half a pack of 50) and ordered 100 more (2 packs of 50).
* They ended day 3 with 78 bandages.

Working backwards, they had 78 - 25 = 53 bandages before using any on day 3.

That means they had 53 - 100 = -47 bandages before ordering more on day 3. This doesn't make sense!  They must have started with more than 47 bandages.

Let's try adding the 100 bandages they ordered on day 3 to the 53 they had left at the end of day 3: 53 + 100 = 153 bandages.

"Okay, let's break this down. John spends $60 per bottle of scotch, and he buys 10 bottles, so that's $600. Cognac is 50% more expensive, meaning each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.  In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's think about this:

If eight more than four times the number of mugs is 40, we can set up an equation. Let 'm' be the number of mugs.  

So, 4m + 8 = 40

Divide both sides by 4: m = 8

There are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

There are 66 fish in total. One-third have red stripes, so that's 66 / 3 = 22 fish.

That leaves 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.

Of those, 5/11 have blue stripes, which is (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.

Adding the red and blue striped fish, we get 22 + 20 = 42 fish.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

The house is 7 times Mattison's height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall.

The first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, meaning it's 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.

To find the height from the second floor to the roof, we subtract the height of Mattison and the first floor from the total house height: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

So the answer is 240.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280 shells (700 * 0.40 = 280).

That leaves 420 shells (700 - 280 = 420).

The Finders snagged 60% of those, which is 252 shells (420 * 0.60 = 252).

That means Team Gogetters found the rest: 168 shells (420 - 252 = 168).

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  If the dogs need to walk an average of 3 miles each, and there are 4 dogs, that means they need to walk a total of 12 miles (4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles).

The first three dogs need to walk 8 miles altogether (1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles = 8 miles).  

That means the last dog needs to walk 4 miles (12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles).

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. The jar's volume is 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches. But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means we have 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of space for jelly beans.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

If 30% of the jelly beans are red, then there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people, then picks up 40 more. That's 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Then, at the next stop, 3/4 of those 40 people get on, which is 30 people (3/4 * 40 = 30).

Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Pauline spent.

She goes to the museum 3 times a year at $2 a visit, so that's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.

Over 5 years, she spends $6/year * 5 years = $30.

The price goes up by 150%, which means it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3.

The new price is $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5/visit * 3 visits/year * 3 years = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Let's break this down.  If the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being divided into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Since the whole board is 40 feet long, each of these parts is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of these parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

If Carly needs 10 treats total and each person gets 2, she's making treats for 5 people.  Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) = 10 treats.

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10.

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Let's figure this out! There are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, so there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks. That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.  Since there are 32 blocks in total, there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. Elvis drove 5 hours west at 18 mph, covering 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he drove 8 hours east at the same speed, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles. Since he drove further east than west, he's 144 - 90 = 54 miles east of his house.

"Let's break down the depreciation step by step:

* **Year 1:** The boat loses 30% of $9000, which is $2700.  That leaves it worth $6300.
* **Year 2:** Another 30% depreciation on $6300 is $1890. The boat is now worth $4410.
* **Year 3:** A 20% depreciation on $4410 is $882.  The final value of the boat is $3528.

"Let's figure this out!  

There are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, meaning there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

In total, there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.

Since there are 232 candies in total, there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out Helen's trip expenses. 

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.

Since she took the bus 7 times, that's a total of $8 * 7 = $56 for bus fares.

Her hotel stay for 3 nights cost $80 * 3 = $240.

Adding the bus and hotel costs, Helen spent a total of $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.

"Hi there!  

To figure out how much force John needs, we first need to find the total weight of everything in the car. That's the car itself plus the luggage and his kids: 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 1600 pounds.

Now, we need to find 1% of that weight: 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

So John needs to push with 16 pounds of force.

"
"Hi there!  

To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by 2. Emma is 16 years older than Mia, so Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  Their combined age is 40 + 56 = 96 years. The average age is 96 / 2 = 48 years.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed a day (4 pounds twice a day).  That means all five pigs eat 40 pounds a day. Over a week, that's 280 pounds (40 pounds/day * 7 days). If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 20 pounds left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John needs to spend.

He needs 40 hot dogs in total (20 guests * 2 hot dogs each). Since he already has 4, he needs to buy 36 more.  

Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he'll need 6 packs (36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack).

At $2 per pack, that'll cost him $12 (6 packs * $2 per pack).

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent. 

The T-shirts are a bit tricky. Since he gets one half off, he pays full price for one ($8) and half price for the other ($8 / 2 = $4). That means the T-shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are easier.  40% off of $40 is $16, so he pays $40 - $16 = $24 for the shoes.

Adding the T-shirts and shoes together, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break this down. Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, Igor brought 8. He wanted 14 Petri dishes, Igor brought 16.  That means Igor brought 8 extra items (16 Petri dishes - 14 Petri dishes = 2 extra, plus the 6 fewer test tubes he brought).

Since Igor brought 29 items total and 8 of those were extra, he must have brought 21 of the requested items (29 total items - 8 extra items = 21 requested items).

Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, so Igor must have lost 0 beakers (21 requested items - 16 test tubes - 14 Petri dishes = -7 beakers, but you can't lose a negative number of beakers).

"Let's break this down!

We know each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4.  If we have a total of 70 legs and 20 animals, we can figure out how many chickens there are.

Here's how:

* **Think about the possibilities:** If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40). That's not enough!
* **More cows, more legs:** Since we have more legs than that, we know there must be some cows. Each cow adds 2 extra legs compared to a chicken.

* **Let's try some combinations:** We need to find a mix of chickens and cows that adds up to 70 legs.  

After a bit of calculating, I found that 5 chickens and 15 cows would work!
