"Alright, let's break this down.  A 150% increase on the original $80,000 is a $120,000 bump in value.  Add that to the original price and you're looking at a total value of $200,000.  

Subtract his total investment of $130,000 and you've got a $70,000 profit.

"Hey there!  

So, James is doing some serious sprinting! Let's see... 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. That means he's running 3 * 60 = 180 meters each day.  Over a whole week, that's 180 * 3 = 540 meters.

"
"Well, let's see. Wendi's chickens need 3 cups of feed each per day, and she's got 20 chickens. That's 60 cups in total. She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups.  So she needs to give them 20 more cups in the last meal.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Every other glass is a steal at 60% off! So, he's basically paying full price for half the glasses and 60% for the other half.

Since he's getting 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs. Each pair costs $5 + ($5 * 0.60) = $8.

So, 8 pairs at $8 each is a total of $64.

"
"Let's break this down. Charleston has four times the sheep Seattle has, so that's 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has double Charleston's amount, meaning they have 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.  

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 plus Charleston's 80 plus Toulouse's 160 gives us a total of 260 sheep.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Carla's download gets interrupted, so she has to start over. That means we need to figure out the total time to download the whole 200 GB file.

* First, she downloads 80 GB (40% of 200 GB) before the restart. That takes her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute).
* Then there's the 20-minute restart delay.
* Finally, she has to download the remaining 120 GB, which takes another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  John drove 180 miles out, then spent two hours stuck.  After that, he only covered 15 miles in the next half hour.  That leaves him with 1.5 hours at 80 mph, which is another 120 miles.

So, he covered a total of 135 miles on the way back. Since he drove 180 miles out, he's 45 miles from home.

"Hey there!  Looks like this program is gaining some traction. Let's see... 

* Month 2 was a big jump: 60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads
* But then things cooled off a bit in month 3: 180 downloads * 0.30 = 54 downloads less
* So month 3 had: 180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads
* Adding it all up: 60 downloads + 180 downloads + 126 downloads = 366 downloads

"Alright, let's break down Toula's bakery haul. 

* Those donuts are gonna cost her 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.
* The mini cupcakes will set her back 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.
* And those mini cheesecakes? 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

"Let's break this down.  If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling half her remaining stock to the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house.

Then, she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before that.

Finally, she sold a third of her original amount to the green house.  That means two-thirds of her starting amount is 12, so she started with 12 / (2/3) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, 20% of the class is doing contemporary, which is 4 students. That leaves 16 students. Then 25% of *those* students are into jazz, so that's another 4 students. That means 12 students are left for hip-hop.

12 out of 20 students is 60%.

"Hey there!  

If the book is 25% off, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, totaling $33.
* That means the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.
* Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie bought $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* Mishka spent $16.50 per pair of shorts, and she bought 3 pairs, so that's 16.50 * 3 = $49.50 on shorts.
* Pants were $22.50 each, and she got 3 pairs, totaling 22.50 * 3 = $67.50.
* Shoes cost $42 per pair, and she bought 3, making the shoe cost 42 * 3 = $126.00.

Adding up all the costs: 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00 = $243.00

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Cynthia eats a serving a day, so in 60 days she'll need 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).

At $4.00 a carton, that'll cost her $16.00 total (4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00).

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Henry biked 20 miles to his first stop, and his second stop was 15 miles from the finish line. That means he traveled 60 - 15 = 45 miles before his second stop.  So, he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.

"
"Let's break this down. The more expensive heels cost twice as much as the cheaper pair, so they're $33 * 2 = $66.  Together, both pairs cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  If Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio, and their combined age is 162, we can figure out their individual ages.

Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  There are 18 parts total (7 + 11). Each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

* Friend 1 says 80 jelly beans.
* Friend 2 says 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess, so that's (80 / 2) + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* Friend 3 says 25% more than Friend 1's guess, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80 jelly beans.

"
"Let's break this down. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and we know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can think of it like this:

* **Let 'x' be the number of silver coins.**
* **Gold coins would then be 'x + 30'.**

Since the total number of coins is 110, we can set up an equation:

* **x + (x + 30) = 110**

Combining like terms:

* **2x + 30 = 110**

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

* **2x = 80**

Dividing both sides by 2:

* **x = 40**

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins:

* **Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70**

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Terry needs 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, that's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.  Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5 = $75.00 on yogurt.

"Hey there!  

To figure out John's speed, we need to know his total running time. He runs 3 hours the first day and 1.5 hours each on the other two days, for a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running per week.

Since he runs 60 miles in those 6 hours, he's running at a speed of 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).

That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"Alright, let's figure this out. You've got 200 calories left and each serving of these chips is 250 calories.  That means you can only have 0.8 of a serving. Since a bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, one serving is 60 grams.  So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams of chips.

"Alright, let's break this down.

Truck tires bring in $60 a pop, and car tires are $40 each. On Thursday, he did 6 trucks and 4 cars, so that's 6 * $60 = $360 from trucks and 4 * $40 = $160 from cars. That's a total of $520 for Thursday.

Friday was all cars, 12 of them, so that's 12 * $40 = $480.

Looks like Thursday was a better day by $520 - $480 = $40.

In the second half of the year, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there!  Victor here, the sandcastle expert.

Alright, so the top level is 16 square feet, and each level is half the size of the one below it. That means we've got a little pattern going:

* Top: 16 sq ft
* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 sq ft
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 sq ft
* Bottom: 64 * 2 = 128 sq ft

To find the average, we add up all the levels (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 sq ft) and divide by the number of levels (240 / 4 = 60 sq ft).

So the average square footage per level is 60.

So, after the girls took their share, there was 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters left. Then the boy took 6 liters, leaving 16 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Charlie started with 10 stickers, got 21 more, and then 23 more for his birthday. That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers! Then he gave away 9 and used 28, so 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds. So, that's 4 * 125 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds.

"Well, that's easy!  If each rose bush has 25 roses and there are 8 thorns per rose, that's 25 * 8 = 200 thorns per bush. With 3 bushes, that's a total of 200 * 3 = 600 thorns.

"
"Let's see... the alarm rang 4 times the first time, then 4 times * 3 = 12 times the second time.  The third time it rang for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times / 2 = 6 times.  In total, the alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

"Hey there!  Sylvie's salary will be $798.60 after three more years. Here's how I figured that out:

* Each year, her salary goes up by 10% of what it was before.
* After one year, she'll make $660.
* After two years, she'll make $726.
* After three years, she'll make $798.60. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, think of it like this: Harald's sales are one ""part,"" and Marilyn's are ten ""parts."" That makes a total of eleven ""parts"" sold.

Since they sold 88,000 copies total, each ""part"" is worth 88,000 / 11 = 8,000 copies.

So Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


8,000
"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  Since not everyone shows up, Christina needs to plan for a little less than the full number of guests.  She's got 16 friends coming, but only expects 3/4 of them to actually make it, which is 12 people.  

Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per person, she'll need 9 gift bags total (12 people * 0.75 gift bags/person = 9 gift bags).

At $2 a bag, that'll cost her $18 (9 gift bags * $2/bag = $18).

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Adults eat a lot, so we gotta make sure there's enough to go around.

* Those 20 adults will chow down on 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad.
* The little dinos will eat half as much, so each kid eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.
* That means the 5 kiddos will eat 5 kids * 5 lbs/kid = 25 lbs.

Add it all up, and Ted needs a whopping 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Cindy has 4 pets, and Marcia has 2 more than that, Marcia has 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 18 pets.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Corey is 1 year older than James, who is 10. So Corey is 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, making her 9.  Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson must be 4.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... two cats for every dog, huh? So that's 60 dogs * 2 = 120 cats.  

That means there are 120 + 60 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.  

If there are 12 fewer rabbits, there must be 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.


348 

"
"Hey there!  

Let's see... 200 kids in total, and 2 out of every 5 are boys. That means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80).

That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80).

So, 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than that, so that's 70 times. The second friend rang it 5 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times, meaning the second friend rang it 25 times.

Adding all those up: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Solo needs to read a total of 39 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8). Since he already read 15 pages, he has 24 pages left (39 - 15).  To read those in 4 days, he needs to read 6 pages each day (24 / 4).

"
"Let's see... John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one more before bed. That's 4 glasses a day on weekdays.  On the weekend, he skips the dinner water and has soda instead. So that's 3 glasses a day on the weekend.

That means he drinks 4 glasses/day * 5 weekdays = 20 glasses during the week.

And on the weekend, it's 3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses.

Adding those together, John drinks a total of 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water in a week.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Fog rolls in at a steady pace, covering 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The whole city is 42 miles wide.

So, we need to figure out how many 3-mile chunks are in 42 miles: 42 miles / 3 miles/chunk = 14 chunks.

Since each chunk takes 10 minutes to fog over, the whole city will take 14 chunks * 10 minutes/chunk = 140 minutes.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to figure out the space inside.  

* Inside length: 5 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 3 inches
* Inside width: 6 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 4 inches
* Inside height: 4 inches (outside) - 2 inches (walls) = 2 inches

That means each box has 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches of space inside.

Since he has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

"
"Let's see... Frankie watched 7 hours total.  He watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday. That's 5.5 hours total.  That means he watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday. Since each of those 30-minute shows is half an hour, he must have watched 3 episodes.

"
"Let's see... he had 110 cookies left after dropping some, and that was 5 less than he baked. So he baked 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.  He baked 15 more than he planned, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Since that's twice the amount he made last year, he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.

"Hey there! Victor here, ready to crunch some numbers.

Let's see, Beatrice ate 2 rolls wide by 24 rolls long, that's 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups. Marcell ate 3 rolls wide by 14 rolls long, so that's 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.  

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of people: 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups per person.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  We know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she's rowing at a speed of 1.25 feet per second.

To reach the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, meaning she rows a total of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet, the boat takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Lumber prices going up 50% is a nice little bonus for Sasha! 

Here's the breakdown:

* **2x4s:** She's got 10 of those, and they're worth $15 each now. That's 10 * $15 = $150.
* **4x4s:** She's got 5 of those, and they're worth $24 each now. That's 5 * $24 = $120.

So, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270 selling everything.

Since she spent $100 on the 2x4s and $80 on the 4x4s, her total profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Alright, let's break this down.  A 7:13 ratio means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is teaspoons of sugar.

Think of it like this: each ""part"" of the ratio represents a certain amount.  

*  7 + 13 = 20 total parts

* 120 / 20 = 6  This means each ""part"" is equal to 6.

* Since the sugar ratio is 7, she used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning Lylah made 100/130 of what Adrien made. If Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago, Lylah was making (100/130) * $40,000 = $30,769.23.

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so four years later he's making $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so she's now making $30,769.23 + (0.40 * $30,769.23) = $43,076.92.

Adding their salaries together, we get $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

* Peppers: 20 peppers * $15/pepper = $300

"Well, let's see here.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees. That means for every queen bee, there are 2 baby bees and 4 worker bees.  So, if we think of it as groups of 7 bees (1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers), we can figure out how many groups there are in the whole hive. 700 bees divided by 7 bees per group is 100 groups.

Since each group has 4 worker bees, there are 100 groups * 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

Kelly runs back and forth once for 100 yards, then does 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back, which is 34 times 80 yards, or 2720 yards.  That means she runs a total of 2820 yards. Kelly wins by 1320 yards!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Raphael spent.

* Those pens cost him 4 * $1.50 = $6.00
* The notebooks were 2 * $4.00 = $8.00
* And the bond paper was $20.00

Adding it all up, Raphael spent $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00

"Well, let's see. Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more pop up, so that's 11 plus 6, which is 17. But then 2 of them scoot under a rock, so we take 2 away from 17. That leaves 15 tadpoles.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... the tank started with 17 feet, then got 7 more on Tuesday, making it 24 feet deep.  On Wednesday, it was two-thirds full compared to Tuesday, so that's (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures, and Locsin caught some too.  

* Anakin had 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 sea creatures.
* Locsin had 5 starfish + 3 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 13 sea creatures.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 sea creatures!

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  A 20% increase every two months means the price is going up by $4 each time ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Over 36 months, there are 18 of these two-month periods. So, the price goes up by $4 a total of 18 times.

That's an extra $72 ($4 x 18 = $72).

Add that to the original price: $20 + $72 = $92

"Let's break down the cost:

* Each action figure is $5, so 3 action figures cost $15.
* The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it's also $15.
* The red cars are $4 each, and there are 5, making them a total of $20.

Adding it all up: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50

"Hey there!  Let's break this problem down.

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is represented by 2*b (where 'b' is Brooke's age).

In two years, Seth will be 2*b + 2 years old, and Brooke will be b + 2 years old.

We know that in two years, their combined age will be 28. So, (2*b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have 3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Let's break this down. Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, meaning she's 8 * 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19.  

Adding up their ages, we get 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"Alright, let's break this down. 60 potatoes is a lot to handle!  

Peeling takes the longest, at a minute and a half per potato. That's 90 minutes right there (60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes).

Cutting's a breeze, only 5 seconds a spud. That's another 5 minutes (60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes).

So, all in all, Billy's looking at 95 minutes of potato prep (90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes).

"Hey there!  Lemonade stands are my jam!  

To figure out how much they spent on lemons, we gotta think about how much profit they made per gallon. They sell each glass for 50 cents and get 20 glasses per gallon, so that's $10 per gallon.  Since each gallon costs $5 to make (lemons and sugar), they make a $5 profit on each gallon.

They made $25 total, so they sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5).

Since lemons cost $3 per gallon, they spent $15 on lemons (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).

"Alright, let's break this down.  

There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

That means rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely.

"Well, let's see here. Tom's got a bit of a tree situation going on!  

He plants 10 a year and cuts down 2, so he's netting 8 new trees every year. Over 10 years, that's 80 new trees (8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees).

Add that to his starting amount, and he's got 130 trees (50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees).

But wait, 30% of them kick the bucket! That's 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).

So, after all that, Tom's left with 91 trees (130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees).

"Alright, let's break this down.  We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in water levels is due to how much they had to start with.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the big pool lost less water in those four minutes.  

Think of it this way: the big pool started with a bigger cushion, so even though they're both losing water at the same rate, the big pool still has a larger lead.

To figure out how much water is in the small pool now, we need to work backwards.  Since they both lose 4 gallons per minute, the small pool must have 8 gallons in it now.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, who is 20. That makes Joan 25. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 23.

"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let's break this down.

So, 30% of the students left through exit A, which is 300 students (30/100 * 1000 = 300). That leaves 700 students (1000 - 300 = 700).

Then, 420 of those students went out through exit B (3/5 * 700 = 420).

That means 280 students must have used exit C (700 - 420 = 280).

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That's 6 letters he gets and 6 letters he sends, for a total of 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages he writes and receives every week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then 60 pages takes him 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.

That's 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours of writing a week.

"Alright, let's break this down. Griffin started with 24 fries, Kyle snagged 5, and Billy took double that, which is 10 fries. That's 15 fries gone already, leaving Griffin with 9. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so that's 2 fries.  That leaves Griffin with 7 fries before Ginger stepped in. Since he ended up with 27, Ginger must have given him 20 fries.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... 32 snails minus 4 snails is 28 snails.  That means there's a difference of 28 snails between the two tanks. Since that difference is twice the number of fish in each tank, we divide 28 by 2 to find out how many fish are in each tank.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, the makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours a day, that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 a week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, making the total cost before the discount $6000 * 5 = $30,000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

So, the final price Jean pays is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much each person paid.

First, we add up all the costs: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Sue ate a lot of cookies! On Monday, she had 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. That's 20 * 200 = 4000 calories! Her sister only had 5 * 200 = 1000 calories worth.

The next day, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, which is 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister had 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

We know the first two classes have a combined 27 girls (15 + 12). That means the third class must have 3 girls (30 total girls - 27 girls).

Since each class has 20 students, the third class must have 17 boys (20 total students - 3 girls).

* Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, meaning he went 21 * 4 = 84 times.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

If there are 40 new cows and 20 stalls, that means each stall gets 2 more cows. So, each stall now has 22 cows.

"Well, let's see here.  A redwood that's 200 feet tall is a mighty big tree!  

If each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, and those pesky termites ate 30% of it, we gotta do a little math.

That's 20 sections in total, so the whole tree started out at 8000 pounds.  

Thirty percent of that is 2400 pounds of wood gone.

That means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds.

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he's got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together, they have a total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Let's break down this knitting project!

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, which is 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, so it needs 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

That leaves 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches for both sleeves.

Each sleeve takes 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this problem down. If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can figure out Sam's current age.

Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now. That means Ruby is 6s years old.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.

We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Simplifying that equation:

6s + 9 = 3s + 27

3s = 18

s = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old.

Adding those together, we get 2800 + 2100 = 4900 total spots. Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

So, we've got 12 players plus 3 coaches, that's 15 people right there. Then each player brings 2 guests, so that's another 24 people.  That means Maddy needs enough pizza for 39 people total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so she'll need 13 pizzas (39 people / 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas).

If each pizza costs $15, then Maddy will spend $195 in total (13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195).

Add those all up, and we know it equals the total team size: *d* + 2*d* + *d*/2 = 105

To solve for *d*, we combine the *d* terms: 3.5*d* = 105

Finally, divide both sides by 3.5 to find the number of defensive players: *d* = 30

"Hey there!  Let's see... 2 families of 6 is 12 people, and 3 families of 4 is another 12. So that's 24 people invited.  But 8 got sick, and 2 more had other things to do. That means 10 people couldn't make it.  So 24 minus 10 is... 14 people at the party!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His dad gives him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  A pool that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep has a volume of 120 cubic feet (6 x 4 x 5 = 120).  Since it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill, the total cost would be $12.00 (120 x $0.10 = $12.00).

"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let's break this down.

If there are 30 boys, and there are 3 times as many girls, that's 30 * 3 = 90 girls.

They also have 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so that's 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered kids.

Adding it all up, there are 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children in the classroom.

"Hey there!  Victor the electrician here.  

You've got a 1:3 ratio of poles to wires, and you know you need 45 wires. That means for every pole, you need 3 wires.  So, you'd need 45 wires / 3 wires per pole = 15 poles.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If Jam has 26 pencils and 2 are loose, that means she has 24 pencils in boxes. Since those pencils are split evenly between 3 boxes, each box holds 8 pencils.

Now, Jam and Meg have a total of 72 pencils (26 + 46). To store all those, they'd need 9 boxes (72 / 8 = 9).

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. To get a 65-degree drop, she'll need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

We know 40 out of the 100 employees are junior programmers making $2000 each. That's a cool $80,000 right there.

The other 60 are senior programmers, and they make $400 more than the juniors, so they're pulling in $2400 each. That adds up to $144,000 for the senior team.

Adding those together, the company shells out a total of $224,000 every month for their programmers.

Job A is straightforward: $15 an hour for 2000 hours is $30,000.  But then you gotta take out 20% for taxes, leaving you with $24,000.

Job B is a little trickier.  You start with $42,000, but then you gotta pay $6,000 in property tax, leaving you with $36,000. Then they take 10% for income tax, which is $3,600. That means your take-home pay is $32,400.

So, Job B pays $8,400 more than Job A.

"Hey there!  Let's break down these furniture costs.

Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 a month for 6 months. That's $350 * 6 = $2100 in installments, for a total of $2100 + $1350 = $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 a month for 9 months. That's $250 * 9 = $2250 in installments, for a total of $2250 + $1100 = $3350.

The difference is $3450 - $3350 = $100.

So Furniture United is $100 more expensive.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If two groups are the same size, and the third is 10 smaller, we can think of it like this:

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 200 students, so: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving for x, we get x = 70.

That means the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Well, let's see here.  If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, and he's got 60 animals total, we can figure this out.  

Think of it like this:  Let's say he has 20 cows. That means he'd have 40 chickens (20 x 2).  

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so those 20 cows have 80 legs (20 x 4). The chickens have 2 legs each, so those 40 chickens have 80 legs (40 x 2).

Add those together, and you get 160 legs in total.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

John spent 15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows. That's 30% of his whole vacation.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole trip was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

He spent 40% of that time sightseeing, so he was sightseeing for 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Annabelle needs $400 and already has $80. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Her first job will give her $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

Her second job will give her $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

That's a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she'll have $275 + $80 = $355.

So, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 years younger than twice his son's age.  To find the son's age, we can set up an equation: 2 * (son's age) - 5 = 45.

2 * (son's age) = 50
son's age = 25

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

That train's got a pretty good route going.  First leg is 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 miles less than the total of those two to get back to the start. That last leg is 125 miles.

So, a full round trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

If it does that three times a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles a day.

Now, it needs service every 18,000 miles. So, it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing a tune-up.

"Alright, let's figure out the cost of these senior gifts. 

* We've got 44 seniors getting picture frames at $20 each, so that's 44 * $20 = $880.
*  Each frame needs etching, which adds 20% to the cost, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  
*  That means etching all the frames will cost 44 * $4 = $176.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
*  A quarter of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
* Each officer gets a cord for $12, so that's 11 * $12 = $132.

Adding up all the silver pesos, we get 50 + 100 = 150.  Adding all the gold pesos, we get 80 + 120 = 200.

Finally, adding the silver and gold pesos together, we have 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.

"Alright, let's break this down. Millie's got 36 cups of lemonade to sell (3 pitchers x 12 cups/pitcher).  She's selling each cup for a buck, so if she sells it all, she'll make $36.  But she spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $18 ($36 - $18).

Since she sells 4 cups an hour, and has 36 cups total, that's 9 hours of selling (36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours).  

Her profit per hour is $2 ($18 / 9 hours = $2/hour).

"
"Well, let's see here.  If Nancy saw 90 spiders, and a third as many millipedes, that's 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.  Then she saw twice the number of millipedes minus 12 stink bugs, so that's (30 * 2) - 12 = 48 stink bugs.  Adding them all up, she saw 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs.

"Hey there!  Victor the builder here.  

Let's see... 4 weeks a month times 6 days a week is 24 days a month.  That's 288 days a year.  At $50 a day, he'd make $14,400 in a year.

$14,400 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  A quadruple batch needs four times the ingredients. So that's 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 6 bags (12 / 2 = 6). He'll need 2 bottles of milk (4 / 2 = 2). That means he needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Hey there!  

So, Mel's saving 5 hours of AC use each day. That's 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours saved per day.  

Since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, that's 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours saved daily.

Over 30 days, he'll save 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Hey there!  Victor here.  

Let's see... two zebras with 17 stripes each is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then we've got 36 stripes plus another 18 stripes (half of 36). That's a total of 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

With four zebras, the average is 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

They paid each employee $15 an hour for a 40-hour week, so that's $600 a week.  Over a month, that's $2400 per employee. In May, they had 40 employees, so that's $96,000 for the month.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, leaving 30.  So, they paid out $72,000 that month.

Adding those together, the company paid out a total of $168,000 over the two months.

"Well, this is a classic animal counting problem!  Let's see... 

If we think of each hump as representing one animal, we have 304 humps. Since camels have two humps, we know some of those humps belong to camels and some to dromedaries.

We also know there are 180 animals in total.  

Hmm, a bit of algebra should do the trick!

There are 56 dromedaries.

"Hey there!  Victor here. Sounds like Tom had quite the adventure! Let's break down his mileage:

* **First four days:** 200 kilometers a day for four days is 800 kilometers.
* **Next two days:** That's 30% of his first four days, so 800 kilometers * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* **Second week:**  He covered 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 2100 kilometers.

Adding it all up: 800 + 240 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Alright, let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards.  You can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, meaning he sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 33 / (2/3) = 49.5 cards is his total.  Since you can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards.

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  We're given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. So, to find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, the perimeter is twice the length plus twice the width: 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

James is a bit slower on the bike, but faster in the water.  Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have made up some time on the run.  

Here's the thing:

* Jon's swim: 40 minutes
* James's swim: 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes (10% faster)
* Jon's bike: 80 minutes
* James's bike: 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

That means James is already 9 minutes behind after the bike. To win, he needs to make up 19 minutes (10 minute win + 9 minute deficit).

So, James's run time must be 50 minutes (Jon's run time) - 19 minutes = 31 minutes.

Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet, Bob will need 160 bags (320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags).

That's gonna cost him $1920 (160 bags x $12/bag = $1920).

"Alright, let's break this down. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her bag cost $20 less than three times that amount, we can figure out the bag's price like this:

Three times the shoe price is 3 * $80 = $240.

Then, $20 less than that is $240 - $20 = $220.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds are Pomeranians, that means she has 18 Pomeranians (27 / 3 * 2 = 18).  

Since one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, she has 6 girl Pomeranians (18 / 3 = 6).

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Two packs of razors at four razors a pack means she's getting eight razors total.  With the buy one get one free deal, she's essentially paying for two packs, which is $8.00.  Then, she knocks off $2.00 with the coupon, bringing her total to $6.00.  That means each razor costs $6.00 / 8 razors = $0.75.  

Converting that to cents, each razor costs 75 cents.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We've got nine cheerleaders at 64 inches tall, and one at 60 inches.  That means the base of our pyramid is gonna be pretty tall!  

Let's see... 9 cheerleaders times 64 inches is 576 inches. Add in the shortest cheerleader at 60 inches, and we're at 636 inches total.

Now, we gotta convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches divided by 12 is 53 feet.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So that's 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes of walking each day. Over 5 days, she'd walk 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

If the first place costs a flat $200 plus $5 per person for food, and the second place is $25 per person, we need to find out when those costs are the same.

Let's say 'x' is the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** $200 + $5x
* **Venue 2:** $25x

We want to know when these two are equal, so:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

"
"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If David found half of what Bodhi found, and together they found 43 insects, we need to figure out how many Bodhi found.  Let's think of it like this:

* If David's insects are 1 part, Bodhi's are 2 parts. That's 3 parts total.
* 43 insects divided by 3 parts equals about 14.33 insects per part.

Since we can't have parts of insects, let's round down to 14. That means Bodhi found 28 insects (14 x 2).

David found half that, so he found 14 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 21 insects (14 + 7).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So Cherrie's got 5 friends. Two of them want a whole bunch of gifts, 5 each! That's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts right there.

The other three friends are a little less gift-hungry, wanting only 2 each. So that's 3 * 2 = 6 more gifts.

She's already at 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

But wait, she's got a surprise up her sleeve! She's adding another 10 gifts just for fun.

That brings her grand total to 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

"
"Let's see... Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times what Sophia bought. So Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought, meaning Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Andy wants to drop 30 pounds by July 19th, starting today, December 31st. That gives him about 200 days.

To lose a pound, you gotta burn about 3500 calories. So, for 30 pounds, that's 105,000 calories (30 x 3500).

To figure out his daily deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

"
"Hey there!  Victor here.  

So, the house and lot together cost $120,000, and the house is three times pricier than the lot.  To figure out the house's cost, we can think of it like this:

* Let the lot's price be represented by ""x"".
* The house costs 3 times the lot, so it's worth 3x.
* Together, they cost x + 3x = $120,000

Combining those 'x' terms, we get 4x = $120,000.  

Divide both sides by 4 to find the lot's price: x = $30,000.

Finally, multiply the lot's price by 3 to get the house's price: 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

$90,000

Let's see, she's using 12 kilowatt-hours a day now, and that extra device is 2 kilowatt-hours. So that's 14 kilowatt-hours total each day.

At $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, her daily bill will go up by 2 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $3.00.

Over a week, that's an extra $3.00/day * 7 days/week = $21.00.

Since they're splitting $100, each ""part"" is worth $20 ($100 / 5 = $20).

So, Jeff gets 4 parts, which means he gets $80 (4 * $20 = $80).

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off.

"Alright, let's break this down. Peter's got $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week.  He buys those fancy wooden action figures for $5 a pop for the first four days. That's 4 days * $5/figure = $20 spent on wood.

He's got $50 left for the rest of the week to buy the cheaper plastic ones at $2 each. That means he can snag 25 plastic figures ($50 / $2/figure = 25 figures).

Don't forget the wood! He got 4 of those ($20 / $5/figure = 4 figures).

Adding them up, Peter ends up with a total of 29 action figures.

"Hey there!  Victor here, your friendly neighborhood gardener.

Let's see... Ford's got a bit of a rose shortage going on. He grows 40 roses a week, but those flower shops are ordering 65! That means he's short 25 roses every week.  Over a month, that adds up to 100 roses he's missing.

"Hey there!  

If Katina takes out $100 each month for two years (that's 24 months), she'll withdraw a total of $2400 ($100 x 24).

"Alright, let's break down this grilled cheese operation.  

They're spending $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches, which works out to $0.30 per sandwich. Add in the $3.00 per sandwich for cheese and toppings, and their total cost is $3.30 per sandwich.

Selling each sandwich for $7.00 means they're making a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.  

Sell 10 of those bad boys and they're looking at a cool $37.00 profit.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Carpet, padding, removal, and installation... it all adds up!

* First, we need the total area: 18 feet by 12 feet is 216 square feet.
* Carpet alone is $12 per square foot, so that's 216 * $12 = $2592.
* Don't forget the padding, another $2 per square foot, making it 216 * $2 = $432.
* Taking out the old carpet will cost $4 per square foot, so that's 216 * $4 = $864.
* Finally, installation is $34 per square foot, bringing the total to 216 * $34 = $7344.

Adding it all together: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

"Hey there!  

So, Herb paid $76,000 for his house, and Juan's place is 30% cheaper. That means Juan's house cost $76,000 - ($76,000 * 0.30) = $53,200.

Adding the two prices together, Herb's house plus Juan's, we get $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"Let's see... Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she had 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That's a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she had 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  In total, her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.  

Adding up the utensils both brought, we get 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much more John made than Jill.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 total hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.

That means John worked a total of 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John made $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 1000 calories (500 x 2 = 1000). Running burns 600 calories per hour, so in one hour, she burns another 600 calories. That's a total of 1600 calories burned (1000 + 600 = 1600).

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she'll need 800 ml of water (1600 / 2 = 800).

"Alright, let's break this down.  We know the total number of jelly beans and the relationships between the colors.  

Think of it like this: if the blue jelly beans are our baseline, the reds are a little less, and the greens are a little more.

After crunching the numbers, I get that there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Let's break this triangle problem down. We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other two are 2x and 3x.  

So, x + 2x + 3x = 180. That means 6x = 180.  Divide both sides by 6 and we get x = 30.

The largest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

Then he sold 10 cups an hour for two hours, which is 10 * 2 = 20 cups. At 60 cents each, that's 20 * $0.60 = $12.00.

Adding those together, he made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  If a tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's a lot of rotations!  

We need to see how many times those tires spin in a month: 400 miles/month * (725 rotations/2 miles) = 145,000 rotations per month.

Now, if a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, we divide that by the monthly rotations: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

Finally, to get the number of years, we divide the total months by 12: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

So, those tires should last Jeremy about 6 years.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, John's got a big goal, identifying cancer cells. That's ambitious!  He starts with a solid $100,000 for the first five months. But research rarely goes exactly to plan, does it? Ten times longer means 50 months total. And those extra months cost 50% more each.

That means for 45 months, he's looking at $150,000 per month.  

Let's do the math:

* Initial 5 months: $100,000/month * 5 months = $500,000
* Extra 45 months: $150,000/month * 45 months = $6,750,000
* Total cost: $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000

That's a hefty price tag, but potentially worth it for a breakthrough like that.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Clara got a sweet deal on Tuesday, but Wednesday's price hike was rough.  

* Tuesday's total: 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranate = $400, minus her $2 voucher, brings it to $398.
* Wednesday's total: 20 pomegranates * $30/pomegranate = $600.  That 10% discount saves her $60, so she pays $540.

The difference between the two days is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales:

* She made $800 from green hats since her red hat sales of $400 were half that amount.
* That means her total sales for the first month were $800 + $400 = $1200.
* In the second month, she brought in $1200 * (3/4) = $900.
*  Over the two months, her total sales were $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The plane itself cost him $150,000. Then, he's got $5,000 a month for the hangar and double that for fuel, so that's another $10,000 a month. That's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Add that to the initial cost of the plane and you get $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000 for the first year.

$330000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

If the rice took 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer, that means the pork took 50 minutes.  

Now, the beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together. So that's 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes total. Half of that is 40 minutes for the beans.

Finally, add up all the cooking times: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

Bamboo grows fast, that's for sure!  

Alright, so the bamboo is 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches. We want to know how many days it takes to reach 600 inches. It grows 30 inches a day, so we need to figure out the difference and divide by the growth rate:

"Let's figure this out. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 8 more toys for the 8 new dogs. That's 12 toys total.

Then, the number of dogs doubles, meaning he needs 16 more toys (16 dogs * 1 toy/dog = 16 toys). That brings the total to 28 toys.

Finally, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.  28 - 3 = 25 toys.

"Alright, let's break this down. Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.  The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Adding up all their cookies, we get 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let's break this down.

We know the twins and triplets' ages add up to 44.  And one twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.  

Think of it like this:

*  Let's say the triplet is 'x' years old.
*  One twin is 'x + 7' years old.
*  The other twin is also 'x + 7' years old.

So, the total age is: x + (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x = 44

Combining like terms: 4x + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 4x = 30

Divide both sides by 4: x = 7.5

Since one twin is 7 years older than the triplet, that twin is 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 years old.

* Bananas are going for $1.00 a pop since they're double the price of an apple.
* Oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each – those things are three times the cost of a banana.

So, that's 5 bananas at $1.00 each, which is $5.00. Then we've got 12 apples at $0.50 each, totaling $6.00. And finally, 7 oranges at $3.00 each, coming in at $21.00.

* Then she has 6 more green squares than blue, meaning 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* Finally, she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Adding them all up, she has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

* Tom has 30 less points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Marta collected 3 times Tom's points, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points for the trip, so they're still short 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Dora's dad is twice her age plus eight years, so he's 15 * 2 + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than that, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

Adding up their ages, we get 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"
"Let's see... Boris starts with 100 apples and Beck has 23 less, so Beck has 77.  After Boris gives Beck 10, Beck has 87 and Boris has 90. That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck.

"Hey there!  Let's see... 3 giant cubes use up 12 ounces (3 x 4 = 12), 7 medium cubes use 14 ounces (7 x 2 = 14), and the 8 small cubes use 4 ounces (8 x 0.5 = 4).  That's a total of 30 ounces used (12 + 14 + 4 = 30).

So, he has 2 ounces left over (32 - 30 = 2).

"
"Let's break this down. Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. A gallon of milk is $5, and that's $2 more than a half-gallon. So a half-gallon costs $3.

Ten gallons will set her back 10 * $5 = $50.

Sixteen half-gallons will cost 16 * $3 = $48.

Adding those together, Cecelia spent a total of $50 + $48 = $98.

"
"Hey there!  Victor here.  

Alright, so we've got 80 students split evenly between two classes. That means each class has 40 students. If 40% are girls, then there are 16 girls in each class (40 * 0.40 = 16).

That leaves 24 boys in each class (40 - 16 = 24).

"
"Let's break it down:

* Mara starts with 2 slices and adds 3 more, so she has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.
* She triples that amount, giving her 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
* After eating 2, she has 15 - 2 = 13 slices left.
* Her friend takes 5, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

So the answer is 8.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save.

The second amusement park is definitely the better deal.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Park 1:** 2 adults * $26 = $52, plus 2 kids * $12 = $24, for a total of $76.
* **Park 2:** 2 adults * $14 = $28, plus 2 kids * $10 = $20, for a total of $48.

They'd save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... 60 chairs a day during the week and 100 on the weekends. That's a busy business!

So, 60 chairs/day * 5 weekdays = 300 chairs per week.

And 100 chairs/day * 2 weekend days = 200 chairs per week.

That's a total of 500 chairs per week.

In a month, that's 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks = 2000 chairs.

For two months, she'd rent out 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs.

"Alright, let's break this sticker and button trade down. 

Lorraine's got a good haul to start!  She's got 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.  

First, she trades 90% of those small stickers, which is 27 of them. Each small sticker gets her one small button, so that's 27 buttons right there. And since she can trade 3 small buttons for a large button, those 27 small buttons get her 9 more large buttons.

Next, she trades half of her big stickers, which is 20 of them. Each big sticker is worth one big button, so that's another 20 buttons.

She's still got 20 big stickers left.  She can trade those in for 60 small buttons (20 stickers * 3 small buttons per sticker = 60 buttons).

Adding it all up, Lorraine ends up with 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

If the three houses need 250 cases total, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can set up a little equation. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. That means the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs double the first, or x cases.

So, x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

That means the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Tanya's earnings.

* **Monday:** She taught 4 classes for 5 hours, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 hours of teaching.  She earns $15 per hour, so that's 20 * $15 = $300. Plus, she gets an extra $5 for teaching more than 3 classes, bringing her Monday total to $300 + $5 = $305.

* **Wednesday:** She taught 2 classes for 2 hours, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours of teaching. That's 4 * $15 = $60.

Let's see... they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times. Then on the other two days, they ride twice as much, meaning 3 * 2 = 6 times each day.  So for those two days, it's 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Adding it all up, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Bob started with more white fish than orange fish.  He bought a bunch more fish, and ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. That means some of the fish he bought must have been orange.

Since he bought 17 fish, and we need to figure out how many were white, we can use a little algebra. Let's say 'w' is the number of white fish he bought.

* He bought 17 - w orange fish.
* After the purchase, he had 3 + (17 - w) orange fish.
* After the purchase, he had 4 + w white fish.

We know the orange fish count is double the white fish count, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So Bob bought 4 white fish.

* Fifth grade: 400 students * 80% pass rate = 320 passed

That's a total of 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students who passed.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter. The hotshot friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They're playing for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

The weaker players each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters total for them.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That's $17.00 total.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Tanya's using a 2:1 ratio of oil to salt, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  Since she's also using equal parts zest and fragrance, and it all adds up to 10 ounces, we can figure this out.

Think of it like this:

* **Salt and Sugar:** Let's say she uses 'x' ounces of salt (and sugar).
* **Zest and Fragrance:** Since those are equal to half the salt amount, that's 'x/2' ounces each.
* **Oil:** That's double the salt, so that's '2x' ounces.

Now, add it all up: x + x + x/2 + x/2 + 2x = 10

Simplify: 5x = 10

Solve for x: x = 2 ounces (that's the salt and sugar)

Finally, the oil is double the salt: 2 * 2 = 4 ounces.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Joe has double the cars Robert has, so he starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars. He sells 20% of those, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 cars.  In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars. That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"Hey there!  Victor here.  

So, they raised $175,000 total, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. That means the students raised $125,000 ($175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000).

Since there are 20 students, each student raised $6,250 ($125,000 / 20 = $6,250).

$6,250

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time on the second day, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  We know the total cards are 341.  Let's think of it like this: PJ has a certain number of cards, Smendrick has three times that, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick.

If we let PJ's cards be represented by 'x', then Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Adding those all together, we get x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we have 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 47.

So PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

She also spends 2 hours on songs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

And don't forget the makeup! 15 minutes a day for 6 days is 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

Adding it all up for the week: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

"Well, let's see here. If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take 54 hours to cross the highway on its own.  Now, those turtles are only half as fast, so each turtle would take twice as long, or 108 hours.  With four turtles, they'd be going four times faster than a single turtle, so it would take them 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

Jack's got 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he's got 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter's a sock collector, he's got twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he's got 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter's not as into dishes, though. He only has half as many as Jack, so he's got 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know a few things:

* Sofie has F + 13 books.

Since they have a total of 85 books, we can write an equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"Alright, let's break this down. Colby makes $0.20 per package and does 40 packages an hour (50 - 10 = 40).  That means he makes $8.00 every hour (40 * $0.20 = $8.00). Over an 8-hour day, he'd make $64.00 ( $8.00 * 8 = $64.00).

"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let's break this down.

We know the three ages add up to 100.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the total of Paul and John's ages.  

Think of it like this:

*  If we combine Paul and John's ages, we get Peter's age.
*  Since Paul is older, John's age plus 10 equals Paul's age.

Let's use some math to figure out Peter's age:

*  Let's say John is ""J"" years old.
*  Paul is ""J + 10"" years old.
*  Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" which is ""2J + 10"" years old.

Now, we know all three ages add up to 100:

*  J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Let's solve for J:

*  4J + 20 = 100
*  4J = 80
*  J = 20

Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age:

*  Peter = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50



Peter is 50 years old.

"Alright, let's break this down.  The Widgeteer 3000 churns out widgets like nobody's business, 60 an hour! The WidgetMaster 9000 is a bit slower at 45 an hour.  

Running 24/7 for a month, that's 720 hours.

* Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 43,200 widgets
* WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 720 hours = 32,400 widgets

Now, each widget sells for $6, so...

* Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200
* WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Looks like the Widgeteer 3000 brings in a cool $64,800 more.

"Alright, let's break down this plumbing bill.  

They charge a flat $40 just to show up, then $35 for every hour they're working. Since they were there for 2.25 hours, that's 2.25 * $35 = $78.75 for labor.  

Don't forget the $60 in parts.  

Adding it all up: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75


$178.75

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

James snagged those CDs for a steal at 40% off, so he saved $60 right off the bat. That means he only paid $90 for all ten.

"Hey there!  Let's break down Cayley's commission.

He makes 10% on each New York Times, so that's $5 x 0.10 = $0.50 per paper.  On the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8%, which is $15 x 0.08 = $1.20 per copy.

So, from the Times, he earns $0.50 x 6 = $3.00. From the Journal, it's $1.20 x 10 = $12.00.

Adding those together, Cayley makes a total of $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00 in commission.

"
"Hey there!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Bahati scored the most, and scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra to solve for Azibo's points.

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, their points add up to 45: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

Over 15 hours, that's 120 * 15 = 1800 reports.

"Ahoy, matey!  Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 more the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. But they filled in two of 'em, so that leaves 29 holes.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first. That means there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  

Now, since ye can't have a quarter of a hole, I reckon that map be a bit off.  But we can still figure out how many they dug on the fourth day.  They had 29 holes and needed 7 at the end of the first day, so they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

We know they caught a total of 339 Pokemon.  Let's see... Stan has 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught.  And Alex caught 5 more than Stan.  

Hmm, a little algebra should do the trick.

*Let Adelwolfe's Pokemon be 'A', Stan's be 'S', and Alex's be 'X'*

*Stan's Pokemon: S = 4A - 13*
*Alex's Pokemon: X = S + 5*
*Total Pokemon: A + S + X = 339*

Now we can work with this.

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplifying that...

9A - 21 = 339

9A = 360

A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, to find Stan's Pokemon:

S = 4(40) - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

Over 8 days, she'll need 32 ounces total (4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces). Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 4 bottles for her trip (32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles).

"Hey there!  Victor here.  

Let's see... the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which costs $100. That means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price.  

So, the red car costs 0.60 * $100 = $60.

Together, they cost $100 + $60 = $160.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

When Emil is 24, his dad will be 48 (twice Emil's age). That means his dad is currently 43 (48 - 5).

Emil's brother will be 12 when Emil is 24 (half Emil's age), making him 7 now (12 - 5).

Adding their ages, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom, 30 from her sister (10 more than her mom), and 40 from her friend (twice what her mom gave).

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Joe's got 3 pounds from Thursday, then 4 times that on Friday, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. Saturday he got half of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Adding it all up, he's got 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.

Since each serving is 3 pounds, he's got 21 / 3 = 7 servings.

"Alright, so 20% of the class are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students. That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.  Then 25% of those students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.  

In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta figure out how many plants will fit in that flower bed.  It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches. Each plant needs 30 inches (12 inches wide plus 18 inches of space). So, 1332 inches divided by 30 inches per plant means she can fit 44.4 plants. Since you can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants total.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17 = 28).

Those cost $6 each, so she'll spend $168 at the store (28 plants * $6/plant = $168).

"Well, let's see... Buford's got a lot of bills!  He writes one check each month for electric and gas, so that's 12 checks each for those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And the pest and lawn folks get paid every three months, so that's 4 checks a year.  Add it all up, and Buford writes 52 checks a year.

"Let's break this down.  The first plane is busy! It flies to Greece most of the time, and then splits the rest of its flights between France and Germany.  Since the other plane only flies to Poland, and that's half the number of flights the first plane takes, the first plane must make 44 * 2 = 88 trips.  

If 66 of those are to Greece, that leaves 22 for France and Germany.  So, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Hey there! Victor here.  

Let's break this down. Since each adult gets a slice twice the size of a kid's slice, think of it like this: the adults' slices are like two kids' slices each.

Each adult gets 2 out of those 8 shares, which is 25%.

"Hey there!  

So, the Smiths need to figure out how much it'll cost to fill their pool.  First, we gotta find the volume. That's easy: width times length times depth.  

* Volume = 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

Now, they told me to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons.

* Gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons

Finally, multiply the gallons by $0.10 per gallon to get the total cost.

* Cost = 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.00

Looks like it'll cost them $826.00 to fill up that pool.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

* There are 3000 students total, and half are over 16, so that's 1500 students.
* A quarter of those older students are guys, meaning 1500 / 4 = 375 are male and over 16.
* That leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.
* The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16.
* Half of them are guys, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
* That means there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Adding those together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at Brook Hills.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Wanda and Ms. B are working hard!

* **Day 1:** Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so that's 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons. Together they pump in 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her Day 1 amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps in one-third of her Day 1 amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons. That's a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons for Day 2.

* **Total:** Over both days, they pump in 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

* **Remaining:** The tank still needs 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"Hey there!  

This sounds like a classic battery drain problem. Let's break it down:

* The power bank lost 45% in the first 5 hours (9% per hour * 5 hours).
* Then it lost another 21% over the next 3 hours (7% per hour * 3 hours).
* That's a total loss of 66% (45% + 21%).

So, before all that draining, the power bank had 34% left (100% - 66%).

But we know it ended up at 28%. That means Maria's friends used 6% of the power bank's charge (34% - 28% = 6%).

Since that 6% came from the 34% that was left, we can figure out what 100% was originally.

6% represents about 17.65% of the original charge. 


Let me know if you have any other power bank puzzles!

"Let's break this down.  If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones are $4, then large ones are $12.  She sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small ones.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small ones it would be 8x.  

All together, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

* She loses half her yellow balloons, which is 6 (12 / 2 = 6).

So, the only time he's gotta do the homework is if the regular teacher's there, no extension, and no dog-ate-it excuse. That's 50% chance of the regular teacher * 60% chance of no extension * 80% chance he can't get out of it.

If we call the first person's share ""x"", the second person got ""x + $80"", and the third person got ""2 * (x + $80)"" which is the same as ""2x + $160"".

All together, that's x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x' terms and the dollar amounts, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Starting with 120 people, we add 20 at the first stop, giving us 140. Then, at the second stop, 50 get off, and twice that amount, 100, get on. That brings the total to 190. Finally, 80 people leave at the third stop, leaving us with 110.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Alison spent.

* Her shorts cost $15 because they were $5 more than her $10 tank top.
* Her shoes were a steal at $24 since they were half off from $48.
* And with that coupon, her socks only cost $6.

Adding it all up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

"Hey there!  

So, James' insurance went up because of that accident, huh?  

Let's see... 60% more than the usual $120 a month is a hefty increase. That means his new monthly payment is $120 + ($120 * 0.60) = $192.

Over a whole year, that's $192 * 12 = $2304.

Ouch! 


$2304
"
"Hey there!  Let's see... 4 twin beds and 1 king bed means that's 2 loads of twin sheets and 1 load of king sheets each week. So that's 3 loads total every week. Over a year, that's 3 loads a week times 52 weeks, which comes out to 156 loads.

"
"Hey there!  

So Leo started with 100 stickers, then got 50 more last year. This year he got double that, so that's 50 * 2 = 100 more stickers.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Becky ate 10 slices and that's 3 more than Jake, then Jake ate 7 slices. Silvia ate double Jake's amount, so she had 14 slices.  

Adding those up, they ate a total of 31 slices.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Betsy took longer than Donovan, we can think of it like this:

* Donovan's time =  some amount of time
* Betsy's time = Donovan's time + 18 minutes

Together, they took 98 minutes. So, Donovan's time plus Betsy's time equals 98.

Let's use ""x"" for Donovan's time. That means Betsy's time is ""x + 18"".

Now we have: x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining those 'x's: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"
"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let's break this down.

If James gets 80 emails a day and 20% don't need a reply, that means he gets 80 - (80 * 0.20) = 64 emails that need a response each day.

Over a 5 day work week, that's 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails.

"
"Alright, to find the average, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests. So, 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. Then, 380 divided by 4 is 95.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... the glee club had 20 pizzas and ate most of them, leaving 6. The football team had double that, so they had 40 pizzas. They ate a bunch too, leaving 8.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

He's sending out double the big coupons compared to the small ones, so that's 1400 big coupons.

Small coupon postage: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $35.00
Big coupon postage: 1400 coupons * $0.15/coupon = $210.00

Adding those together, his total postage cost is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00



$245.00 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Sidney starts with 7 meatball subs, which means he's got 28 meatballs (7 x 4 = 28). After Mark eats some, Sidney has 3 subs left, that's 12 meatballs (3 x 4 = 12). Then he gets 3 more subs, adding another 12 meatballs (3 x 4 = 12).  

So, Sidney ends up with 24 meatballs (12 + 12 = 24).

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  If a quarter of the trucks broke down, that means 15 trucks made it to the farmers. Since each truck carries 20 tons, they delivered a total of 15 * 20 = 300 tons of fertilizer.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost.

So, she's got a base fee of $125 for 20 people.  She invited a bunch of friends and family, but 4 can't make it. That means 41 people are coming.

Since the base covers 20 people, she's got 21 extra guests (41 - 20 = 21). Each extra guest costs $6, so that's 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding that to the base fee, the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If the first monkey eats 10 bananas a day and the second eats 4 more than that, the first two monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas each day.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800. That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam,  we can think of it like this:

* Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet of fence.
* Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hey there! Victor here, your friendly neighborhood bike shop owner. Let's see... 

Marcel sold a lot of bikes this month!  

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes at half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250 each. That brings in 45 * $250 = $11,250.
* The rest were MTBs, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTBs. Those sold for $500 each, making 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding it all up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 this month. Not bad!

"That's a classic paleontology puzzle!  

Here's how we can figure it out:

* The Allosaurus ate what was left after the velociraptors, so there were 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg before they showed up.
* That 540 kg was only half of what was left after the T-Rex had its fill, meaning the Triceratops had 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat to begin with.

"Alright, let's figure out how much paint Tony needs.  

Two walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 160 square feet (10 * 8 * 2). The other two walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, adding another 80 square feet (5 * 8 * 2).  That's a total of 240 square feet to paint.

Each gallon covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 12 gallons (240 / 20). At $12 a gallon, that'll cost him $144 (12 * 12).

"Alright, let's figure this out. 

Sheila starts with $85.00, then returns something for $15.00, leaving her at $70.00.  The frying pan is $20.00 minus 20%, which is $4.00 off, making it $16.00. The towels are $30.00 minus 10%, or $3.00 off, for a price of $27.00.  Adding those together, her new purchases are $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.  

So, her final balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.


$113.00

"Alright, let's break this down.  We need to figure out how hot that second mug of water needs to be so that when Donny mixes it with the cooler water, it's drinkable.

Think of it like this: the colder water is dragging the temperature down, so the hotter water needs to pull it back up. Since the final mix needs to be at least 40 degrees, and we know how much of each water is being used, we can work backwards to find the minimum temperature of the second mug.

The second mug needs to be at least 68 degrees. 



"
"Well, let's see here.  He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows a day for three weeks, that's 20 times 7 times 3, which is 420 more cows.  Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens a day for three weeks, so that's 10 times 7 times 3, or 210 more chickens.  So, he's got 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.  That makes a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

"Hey there!  Let's break down the bagel cost.

So, Russell's getting 4 packs of bagels at $10 a pop, which is $40 total. But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $4 off, bringing the price down to $36.

Since he gets 9 bagels per pack and he's got 4 packs, that's 36 bagels in total.

Divide the final price by the number of bagels, and you get $1.00 per bagel.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

If it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, then each scoop needs 1.5 potatoes. Gomer ate 18 scoops (23 - 5), so he ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women. If there are 84 passengers total, that represents 14 parts (5 + 9).  

Each ""part"" is worth 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

That means there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"
"Well, let's see... he makes $26 a day from single sunflowers and $56 a day from bouquets.  If each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $56 / 12 = $4.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.  So, each sunflower brings in $2 + $4.67 = $6.67 per day.

Over three days, that's $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01 per sunflower.

He made $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.  So, he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

You can't sell parts of sunflowers, so he sold 12 sunflowers.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Jim has 5 more seashells than Carlos, that means Carlos has 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Since Carlos has twice as many as Carrey, Carrey has 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

Altogether, they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.

When they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Alright, let me crunch some numbers here.  

So, they're making 4200 bottles a day, and each one covers 20% of a person's energy needs. That means they're currently hitting 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

Now, we need to figure out how much more they need to make to cover 100% for 2300 people. That's a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needed.

Subtract what they're already covering: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% still needed.

Finally, divide that by the energy per bottle to see how many more bottles they need: 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 bottles.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, 6 of the babies are in purple, and 2 are in blue.  Of those purple babies, 2 are wearing bows. That means there are a total of 4 babies wearing bows (2 purple + 2 blue).

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Abraham made.

* He started with 80 square meters and sold half for $50, so that's 40 square meters sold.
* Then he sold another quarter (1/4 of 40) which is 10 square meters for $30.
* That leaves him with 30 square meters left.
* He sells those last 30 square meters at $3 each, so that's 30 * $3 = $90.

Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Abraham made $170 selling his land.

Altogether they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding!

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, he's got two complexes with 200 apartments each, that's 400 total. The third one is 60% bigger than those two combined, so that's another 240 apartments (400 x 0.60 = 240).  That means the third complex has 640 apartments.

All together, he's hitting 1440 apartments (400 + 400 + 640 = 1440).

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 4320 collections (1440 x 3 = 4320).

At 40 cents a pop, he's making $1728 a week (4320 x $0.40 = $1728).

"Well, avocado trees are pretty amazing, you know. They take a few years to really get going.  

A 5-year-old tree will give you about 50 avocados. By the time it's 6, that jumps up to 150, and at 7, it's producing a whopping 350!  

An 8-year-old tree is still going strong, but a 10-year-old will blow it out of the water with about 1000 avocados. The 8-year-old will produce about 200 less than that.

Now, the ninth year is a bit of a mystery - sometimes they take a break. But by year 10, they're back in full swing.

So, if you add up all those avocados over 10 years, you're looking at a total of 2350.

"Hey there! Victor here.  Let's break this rope problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue one, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters, we can figure out the red rope's length.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's call the blue rope ""b"".
*  The red rope is ""4b"" (four times the blue rope).
*  The yellow rope is ""b + 7"" (7 centimeters longer than the blue rope).

Now, add them all up:  4b + b + (b + 7) = 37

Combine the 'b's: 6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6: b = 5

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Let's see... he started with 5 inches and used 45%, leaving him with 55% or 2.75 inches.  He uses 20% a day, so that means he has 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 days worth of chalk left.  Since he can't use it when it's too small, he's got **2** more full days.

Since she works 6 days a week, her weekly earnings are $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50.

Over four weeks in April, she'd make $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.

And don't forget her perfect attendance bonus of $10!

That brings her total to $270 + $10 = $280 for April.

Let's see... Trinity's making a smart move buying low and selling high. If she bought the magazines for $72 and sells them for 11/8 of that price, she's selling them for $99.  That means her profit is $27.


$27 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

The dehumidifier removes 1 liter per day on low, so over 3 days, that's 3 liters. On medium, it's double that, so 2 liters per day times 3 days is 6 liters. On high, it's double the medium setting, meaning 4 liters per day times 5 days equals 20 liters.

Add those all up: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"Let's break this down.  

Saanvi needs three times as much of the second medicine compared to the first, so that's 14 mL * 3 = 42 mL.

In total, each dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

For eight doses, she'd need 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. John's classes each hold 120 students / 8 = 15 students. Since he has two classes, that's a total of 15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students.  Adding that to Ali's class of 120 students, we get a combined capacity of 150 students.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So Stephen owes $300 plus 2%, which is $6. That brings the total to $306.

He's paying $25 a month for 11 months, so that's $25 * 11 = $275.

That means he'll owe $306 - $275 = $31 in the twelfth month.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how many jelly beans this jar can hold. It's a pretty standard jar, 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. That's 540 cubic inches total.

Now, you can't pack jelly beans in perfectly, so we gotta account for some air space.  Let's say we get about 80% efficiency, which is pretty typical. That means we're looking at about 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.

Each jelly bean is about 0.15 cubic inches, so we can cram about 2880 jelly beans in there.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he's guessing about 864 red jelly beans.

The real number is 900, so he's off by 36. 


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Hey there!  Victor here.  Let me see... 

So, the bus starts with 20 people, picks up 40 more, then another 30 (that's three-quarters of the first group). That's 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

Then they double at the next stop, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus holds 200, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more folks.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years, that's 3 * 5 = 15 visits.

At $2 a pop, those visits cost her 15 * $2 = $30.

Then the price jumps up by 150%, which is like adding another $3 per visit (150% of $2 is $3).

So, each visit now costs $5.

Over the next 3 years, she goes 3 * 3 = 9 more times.

Those visits cost 9 * $5 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, each grade has 10 kids who get to try the escape room, but they can only go in groups of 8. That means each grade needs to do two groups. Since there are four grades, that's a total of eight groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it'll take 8 groups * 45 minutes/group = 360 minutes for everyone to go.

"Hey there!  Sounds like a straightforward job.  Four tables at twenty bucks apiece is eighty dollars, and two roof frames at ten dollars each is another twenty.  That brings the total to a hundred dollars.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  If the longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter one, think of it like this: the longer piece is made up of 4 of the shorter pieces.  

So, if we divide the total length (40 feet) into 5 equal parts (1 part for the short piece and 4 parts for the longer piece), each part would be 8 feet long (40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet/part).

Since the longer piece is made of 4 parts, it's 32 feet long (4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet).

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  He wants 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 per pound of beef. That means he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of beef. Now, he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"
"Hey there!  

Luke needs enough fabric to cover twice the width of all his windows.  Since he has five windows, each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches.  Double that for the fabric, and he'll need 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric.

"
"Alright, so you wanna know how much a 36-minute call costs from that old payphone, huh?  

First 16 minutes are gonna run you $4.00, then it drops to 20 cents a minute for the rest. So, the other 20 minutes cost $4.00 too.

That brings the total to $8.00 for the whole call.


$8.00 

"
"Well, let's see. If it rained 2 inches on Monday, and Tuesday is supposed to get 1 more inch than twice that amount, we gotta do a little math. Twice Monday's rain is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.  Add one more inch to that, and you get 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class, so she needs 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.

Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

That means the total number of treats is c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"
"Hey there!  So, Karen wants the works, huh?  

Let's see... a mani and pedi will run her $75 normally. But with the 20% off deal for doing both, that knocks it down to $60.  Then, with nail art on all ten fingers at $3 a pop, that's another $30.  

Adding it all up, Karen's total will be $90.

"
"Let's break this down. If Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 fewer than Shelley, then Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Kim must have 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"
"Hey there!  

So the toy went up 80% in December, which means it was 180% of the original price. That's like 1.8 times the original $40, so it was $72.

Then it went down 50% in January, which is half off. Half of $72 is $36.

So the final price was $36. 


$36
"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Standard lessons are $80 a pop, and he's got four of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.  Veterans get a sweet deal at 25% off, so their lessons are $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 each. Two veteran lessons bring in 2 * $60 = $120.  Add it all up, and Charlie's making $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Hey there!  To find the mean, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of scores.

"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes used already.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Rose spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozen eggs, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.  She's selling them in groups of three for a buck each, so she can make 60 eggs / 3 eggs/group = 20 groups. That means she'll bring in 20 groups * $1.00/group = $20.00.  

Her profit is the difference: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Alright, let's break this down. Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).  

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  If Mary made 116 ice cubes total, and the blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, we can figure this out. Let's say she made 'x' strawberry cubes. That means she made 5x - 4 blueberry cubes.  

If we add those together, we get the total: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we have 6x - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6x = 120.

Finally, dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 20.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we plug 20 back into our blueberry equation: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Alright, let's break this down.  Jason needs 15 cars sold, and he knows that for every 25 calls he makes, he gets one person to visit the lot.  Then, for every two visitors, he sells one car.

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (15 customers * 2 visitors per customer = 30 visitors).

To get 30 visitors, he'll need to make 750 calls (30 visitors * 25 calls per visitor = 750 calls).

"Hey there!  Let's see... they've got 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights.  Then they've got 8 rooms, and each room gets 2 flashlights, so that's another 16 flashlights.  

Wait, the question only asked about candles and flashlights together, not just flashlights.  

Okay, so they've got 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, that's 16 small candles. And the other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 20 medium candles.  

Adding it all up, they have 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

And don't forget the flashlights! 4 people flashlights + 16 room flashlights = 20 flashlights.

Finally, 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56 candles and flashlights.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... the new varnish takes 5 extra minutes per painting (12 minutes - 7 minutes = 5 minutes).  Since she's varnishing 6 paintings, that's an extra 30 minutes total (5 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 30 minutes).

* The rest of her plants, 8 of them, only need a quarter cup each, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day.

"Well, let's see here. Phineas has a 200-yard journey, half on land and half in water.  That means he's hopping 100 yards and swimming 100 yards.

If he hops at 20 yards a minute, that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming at 10 yards a minute, the watery part takes 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those up, his whole trip home takes 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

The older brother is 24 (12 x 2). All the sisters together are 48 (16 x 3).  Adding those up with the younger brother, that's 84 years in total.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day and does yoga for an hour five days a week. That's a total of 510 minutes of practice every week. Over four weeks, she'd have clocked in 2040 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much fabric Octavia has for her quilt.

* Those small shirts add up to 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
* The medium shirts give her 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
* And the large shirts are 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Adding it all together, she's got 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet of quilt!

"Hey there! Victor here.  

Let's see... a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more, so that's another 18 seeds (half of 36). That means a big sunflower has 54 seeds. Altogether, that's 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times that amount, then Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"
"Let's break this down. Anne is twice Albert's height, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, putting her at 72"" - 2"" = 70"".  Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.

"
"Well, that's a pretty straightforward calculation. They make 5000 bars a day at $2 a pop, so that's $10,000 per day.  Over a week, that's $70,000. Double that for two weeks and you get $140,000.

$140000 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

* Those T-shirts are a good deal!  Since he gets one half off, the second one is $4.  That means the total for the shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

* The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  That makes the shoes $40 - $16 = $24.

* Adding it all up, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ryan made $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $1.25 each, and he bought four of them, so that's $1.25 x 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets are $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Alright, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business.  

He spends $12 on passion fruit, $12 on jackfruit, and $20 on honey for each jar, totaling $44 in costs. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.  

Selling 10 jars would net him a profit of $60.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Janet has left.

She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15.00 on movie tickets (since they were $7.50 each and she bought two), and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $13.00 left.

"Hey there!  Victor here, your friendly neighborhood mechanic.

Let's see... Josh services 3 cars a day, 5 days a week, and makes $4 per car. That's 15 cars a week, which means he makes $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"
"Let's see... Randy started with 18 cookies. He ate 3, then 2 more, so that's 5 gone. He gave away 2, so now he has 11.  Baking more brings him up to 24 cookies!

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... half of 12 toys is 6.  So he'd make $30 from the first half and $42 from the second half.  That means he'd earn a total of $72.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  The dog digs a whole lotta holes! 

So, 6 holes a day for 14 days is 84 holes total.  

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really making progress by 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).

That's 4 weeks of work (28 / 7 = 4).

"
"Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That's 5670 rainbow and oatmeal cookies altogether.  

So, they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Igor must have lost **0** beakers.  

Let me explain:

He was supposed to bring 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, for a total of 37 items. He only brought 29 items to the lab bench. Since he brought half the test tubes (8) and two extra Petri dishes (16), those account for 24 items. That means he must have brought all 7 beakers.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money the girls raised.

* Kim raised $750 (Alexandra's $430 plus $320 more).
* Maryam raised $700 (Sarah's $300 plus $400 more).
* Altogether, they raised $2180 ($430 + $750 + $700 + $300).

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 4 miles. That means Vanessa ran 8 miles.  Aaron finished his 4 miles in 16 minutes, which means he runs a mile in 4 minutes. Since Vanessa runs half as fast, it takes her 8 minutes per mile.  

So, Vanessa's total time is 8 miles * 8 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Six reservations a night, two meals per table at five bucks a pop, plus a five dollar bottle of wine... that's fifteen bucks per reservation.  So, they're making ninety a night.  Two nights a week, that's one eighty.

"Hey there!  Victor the Vendor here.  

So, he made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons he bought for $80. That means he made an extra $20 (25% of $80).  

Selling them all for $100 means each watermelon goes for $2. 


$2 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Dora's turning 12 in three years, so she's 9 now.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, so he's 37 now. His youngest son was born when John was 32, so the kid is 5. In three years, he'll be 8.

"
"Well, let's see... Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  So, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges. That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there! Sounds like Mark got a sweet deal on that radiator. 

So, he saved $320 on the radiator, which means he paid $80 for it.  Then, with the mechanic charging $50 an hour for 3 hours, that's another $150.  

Adding those together, Mark paid a total of $230.

"Well, let's see... 20 animals with 70 legs... that's a good ol' fashioned system of equations problem!  

If we let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows, we know:

* c + w = 20 (total animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Solving for 'c', we find there are **5** chickens.
