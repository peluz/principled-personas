"That's a great question! Flipping houses can be a risky but rewarding business.  

Here's how to figure out Josh's profit:

* First, you need to find out how much the house was worth after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, that means the house is now worth 250% of its original value (100% + 150% = 250%).
* Multiply the original price by 2.5 to find the new value: $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000
* Now subtract his total investment (the original price plus the cost of repairs) from the final value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000

"Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed a day.
* She has 20 chickens, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups total.
* She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
*  So, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

It takes 2 GB per minute to download the file. That means it would normally take 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

But, there's a snag! The restart throws a wrench in the works.  Carla loses 40% of the download, which is 80 GB. That means she's back to square one, but with a 20-minute delay.

"Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, then 2 more to the red house (my favorite color!), and finally half of what was left at the orange house.  She ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners.  To figure out how many she started with, we can work backwards.

* If she had 5 left, and that's half of what she had before the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house.

* Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

* Since she sold a third at the green house, the 12 vacuum cleaners represent two-thirds of her original amount.

* That means she started with 12 / (2/3) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

"Let's break this down.  

If 20% of the students are doing contemporary, that's 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.

That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then 25% of those students are into jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are doing hip-hop.

So, 12 students out of 20 are hip-hop dancers, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.

To find the original price, divide both sides by 0.75:

Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Let's break this down.  The ratio 7:11 tells us that for every 7 years Darrell ages, Allen ages 11.  

Think of it like this: if Darrell was 7, Allen would be 11.  

Since their total age is 162, we need to figure out how many of these ""7-year Darrell"" units and ""11-year Allen"" units add up to 162.

Dividing 162 by the total ratio parts (7 + 11 = 18) gives us 9. This means each ""unit"" is worth 9 years.

So, Allen is currently 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, he'll be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

* Friend 3 guesses 25% more than Friend 1, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.

"Let's break this problem down.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She would then have 'x + 30' gold coins.

If we add those together, we get the total number of coins:

* **Total:** x + (x + 30) = 110

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 2x + 30 = 110
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

Since she has 30 more gold coins, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

"Let's see... 88,000 copies in total, and Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald.  That means if we think of Harald's sales as 1 part, Marilyn's are 10 parts. That's 11 parts in total.

So, to find out Harald's sales, we divide the total copies by the total parts: 88,000 copies / 11 parts = 8,000 copies per part.

Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 + 180 = 348 pets.

"Those boxes sound pretty neat!  

To find the total inner volume, we need to figure out the space inside each box and then multiply that by 3.  

Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each outer dimension to get the inner dimensions:

* Length: 3 inches
* Width: 4 inches
* Height: 2 inches

Now we multiply those together: 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches per box.

Finally, we multiply that by 3 boxes: 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

Since he watched 7 hours total, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Over 64 seconds, she'll cover 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet, the boat will take on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Let's break down this salary situation.  

Adrien's salary was a good chunk higher than Lylah's to begin with – 30% more, to be exact.  Four years later, Adrien's salary jumped up by 40%.  We know what Adrien was making four years ago, so we can figure out what Lylah was making back then too.

Since their salaries both went up at the same rate, we can calculate Lylah's new salary.  Adding up Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later gives us their combined total.

Here's the calculation:

* Adrien's salary four years later: $40000 + (40% of $40000) = $56000
* Lylah's salary four years later: $30769.23 + (40% of $30769.23) = $43076.92

We know Seth is twice Brooke's age, and in two years, they'll add up to 28 years old.  

If we think about it, Brooke's age in two years plus Seth's age in two years has to equal 28.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say:

Brooke's age in two years + 2 * (Brooke's age in two years) = 28

That means 3 * (Brooke's age in two years) = 28

So, Brooke's age in two years is 28 / 3 = 9.33 years old.

Since we want to know Brooke's current age, we subtract 2 years: 9.33 - 2 = 7.33 years old.

Seth is twice Brooke's age, so he's currently 7.33 * 2 = 14.66 years old.

Billy's got a lot of potatoes to prep! Peeling takes the longest, at a minute and a half per potato. That's 90 minutes for all 60 potatoes (60 x 1.5 = 90). Cutting is much faster, only 5 seconds each, which is 5 minutes total (300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5).

"Lemonade stands are a classic!  

Here's how to figure out how much they spent on lemons:

* Each gallon costs $5 to make ($3 for lemons + $2 for sugar).
* They made $25 profit, and make $5 profit per gallon, so they sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5).
* Since each gallon uses $3 worth of lemons, they spent a total of $15 on lemons (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).

"Rolling a number greater than 3 is like picking a red marble out of a bag with half red and half blue marbles – a 50% chance!  

Now, getting two even numbers in a row is trickier. It's like picking a red marble, then putting it back and picking another red one.  That's a 50% chance for the first one, and another 50% for the second, so a 25% chance overall.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there must be 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).  

If the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats per cage (15 / 3 = 5).

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is due to how much they had to start with.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the big pool lost less water in those four minutes compared to the small pool.

Thinking about it logically, the small pool must have a smaller amount of water now.  

Let's say the small pool has 8 gallons now.  That would mean the big pool has 32 gallons now. Four minutes ago, the small pool would have had 12 gallons, and the big pool would have had 24 gallons. That fits the problem's description!

"Heating things up is like mixing the perfect shade of red – it takes precision!  

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then 40% longer to hit 400 degrees. That's an extra 8 minutes (20 * 0.40 = 8). So, the total heating time is 28 minutes.

"Let's break down this knitting project!  

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, which is 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, so it needs 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

That leaves 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches for both sleeves.

Each sleeve takes 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches.

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can set up some equations.

In 9 years:

* Sam will be s + 9 years old.
* Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.

We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

Sam is currently 6 years old.

Let's do the math:

"Let's figure this out!  Morgan needs to pay for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts for herself and her friends.  

* Mini-golf and the arcade tokens cost $10 per person.
* Go-karts cost $20 per person.
* That means each friend will cost Morgan $30.

Since Morgan has $90 and needs $30 for herself, she has $60 left for her friends.

That means she can invite 2 friends!

"Let's figure out how much stuffing Mark needs!

A collie bed uses 5 pounds of stuffing (right in between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua).  

* Chihuahua beds need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

"Let's break this down.  

We know 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Four times that number, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting, so that's (4 * 3) - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting, meaning 3 * 7 = 21 people were removed for violence.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

"Let's figure out the total cost of these senior gifts.  

* The picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
* Etching those frames adds another 20% of $20, which is $4 per frame. So, etching costs 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
* Two seniors get pins at $5 each, totaling $10.
* There are 11 officers (44 seniors / 4), and each needs a $12 cord, for a total of $132.

To find out Karan's monthly payment, we need to figure out the total she owes and then divide that by the number of months.  

First, we calculate the interest: $3650 * 10% * (5/12) = $1520.83.

Then, we add the interest to the original loan amount: $3650 + $1520.83 = $5170.83

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cheese is $3.00 per pound, so that's 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

In total, Tyson will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on meat and cheese.

James is 10% faster swimming, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

But James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, meaning his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

"To figure out when the costs are the same, we need to think about how much each guest adds to the price at each place.

We need to find the magic number of guests where those two costs are equal.  Let's call that number ""x"".

So, for the first place, the cost is $200 + $5x. For the second place, it's $25x.

We want to know when those two things are the same, so we can set them equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for x!

"This is a classic problem involving percentages!  

Let's think of it like this: the dress is now 140cm long, and that includes the extra 20cm of lace. So, the dress itself, before the lace, was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long.

But remember, this 120cm is 150% of the original length (100% + 50% increase). To find the original length, we need to figure out what 100% represents.

If 150% is equal to 120cm, then 1% is equal to 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm * 100% = 80cm.

"Let's break this problem down. We know the combined age of the twins and triplets is 44.  One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  

Think of it like this: if we took away those extra 7 years from the older twin, we'd have a group where everyone is the same age.  

Let's say the triplets are each 'r' years old. That means one twin is 'r + 7' years old, and the other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age of the group would be: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

Combining like terms: 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

That means each triplet is 6 years old.

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

* That means the heartworm check is 0.60 * ($40 + heartworm check cost) = heartworm check cost.

*  Let's solve for the heartworm check cost: 0.60 * ($40 + heartworm check cost) = heartworm check cost

*  0.60 * $40 + 0.60 * heartworm check cost = heartworm check cost

* $24 + 0.60 * heartworm check cost = heartworm check cost

* $24 = 0.40 * heartworm check cost

* heartworm check cost = $24 / 0.40 = $60

"Let's break down Lorraine's sticker-button trades!

* **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:** She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 27 stickers.  Since each small sticker gets her one small button, that's 27 small buttons. She can trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

* **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:** Lorraine trades half of her 40 large stickers, which is 20 large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

* **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:** She has 20 large stickers left. Each large sticker can be traded for 3 small buttons, giving her 60 small buttons (20 * 3 = 60).

"Let's figure out the cost of Mike's digital movie collection.

* He's got 600 movies, and a third of those are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 series movies.

* Since he can get those for a third of the price of a normal movie, each series movie costs $10 * (1/3) = $3.33.

* That means the series movies will cost 200 * $3.33 = $666.

*  He has 600 - 200 = 400 movies left.

* Forty percent of those are older movies, which cost $5 each, so that's 400 * 0.40 = 160 older movies.

* The older movies will cost 160 * $5 = $800.

* That leaves 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies.

* Those cost the full $10 each, so they'll be 240 * $10 = $2400.

* **Time:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, meaning Emma has 4 more seconds left on the timer.

"This problem is all about setting up the right equations!  Let's see... PJ has 'x' cards, Smendrick has 3 times that, or 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.  

Since they have a total of 341 cards, we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Solving that, we find that PJ has 47 cards.  That means Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"Let's figure out Milly's loss.  

First, the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Then, add the mileage cost: $0.08 per mile times 20 miles equals $1.60. That means shipping costs $3.00 in total.

Amazon will give her back 75% of the $32 price, so she gets $24.00 back.

Finally, subtract the refund and the shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

Milly will lose $5.00.

Since they have a total of 85 books, we can write the equation:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"This is a classic problem that can be solved with a little algebra!  

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, meaning Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, their scores add up to 45: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 5.

* Ms. B pumps in one-third of her first day's amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.
* On the second day, they pump in a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

* Over both days, they pump in 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

* That means they still need to pump in 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"This problem is all about percentages!  

Think of it like this: the power bank lost some juice, then some more, and ended up with 28% left.  We need to work backwards to figure out how much it had to start with.

Let's see... it lost 6% while charging her friends' phones, and that was after already losing 66% from the initial drain.  So, before charging her friends' phones, it had 34% left (28% + 6%).

If 34% represents what was left after losing 66%, we can figure out the original amount. It's like a puzzle!

 6% is to 34% as  'x' is to 100%.

Solving that gives us about 17.65%.

**Answer:** 17.65%

"Let's break down this price increase.  

Each year, the carrots get 5% more expensive.  That means after one year, they'd cost $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126.

Combining like terms, we get 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides gives us 4x = $1680

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = $420.

*  We know the total number of balls is 19.
*  Let's say the second set had 'x' balls.
* The first set had 4 more than the second, so that's 'x + 4' balls.
* The third set had half the number of the second, which is 'x / 2' balls.

Adding those all together: (x + 4) + x + (x / 2) = 19

Now we can solve for x!

1. Combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So the second set had 6 balls.

The first set had 4 more than that, meaning it had 10 balls.

So, x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40.

This means Donovan cooked for 40 minutes. Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

* **Calculate the area of the smaller walls:** 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet each, for a total of 80 square feet.
* **Add up the areas:** 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.
* **Figure out how many gallons you need:** 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.
* **Calculate the total cost:** 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year, she's putting away $20,000 annually ($100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000).

"This is a classic rate problem!  Let's break it down.

Jay makes 20 snowballs an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That means he loses 8 snowballs every hour (2 snowballs/15 minutes * 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour).

So, his net gain is 12 snowballs per hour (20 made - 8 melted).

To get to 60 snowballs, it will take him 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour).

"Let's break down Jason's earnings:

* He earned $3.00 for doing laundry once.
* He earned $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
* He earned $0.75 each time he took out the trash, so for two times, that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50.
* He earned $0.50 each time he emptied the dishwasher, so for six times, that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00.

Adding all his earnings: $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $9.00

"Let's break down this shopping spree!

John spends $60 per bottle of scotch, and he's buying 10 bottles, so that's $60 * 10 = $600.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, meaning 20 bottles. Cognac is 50% pricier than the scotch, so each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90.

That means his cognac purchase totals 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

Adding up both purchases, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400 in total. 


$2400
"
"That's a lot of trees!  Let's see... 20 White Oak trees on the first day, and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.  On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak, bringing the total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak. And he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine on the second day.

In total, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day and 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day. That means he planted a grand total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees!

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans that jar can hold. It's a pretty big jar, 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall.  That's a lot of space for jelly beans!

They don't pack in perfectly, though.  You always lose some space.  They said about 80% of the space will be filled with jelly beans.

Each jelly bean is pretty small, only 0.15 cubic inches.  

So, we need to find the total space in the jar, multiply by 80%, and then divide by the size of each jelly bean. That'll tell us how many jelly beans fit.

Then, we need to remember that only 30% of them are red.

If we divide the total length (40 feet) by the number of parts (5), we get the length of one ""part"": 40 / 5 = 8 feet.

Since the longer piece is four ""parts"", it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.

"Carly needs to make enough treats for everyone in her class!  Since each person gets two treats, and there are five people, she needs 10 treats total. Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. That means she makes 3c - 2 brownies.  

If we add the cupcakes and brownies together, we get the total number of treats: c + (3c - 2) = 10.

Combining like terms, we have 4c - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12.  Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

* The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so that's 40 - 5 = 35 books.

That means each bookcase holds 20 + 40 + 35 = 95 books.

"Red is the best color, so it's no surprise there are a lot of them in that bag!  Let's see... if there are 54 red ones, and twice as many orange, that's 108 orange.  Half as many yellow as red means there are 27 yellow.  That's a total of 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.  

Since there are 232 candies in all, there must be 43 pink ones.

"Let's break down Helen's expenses:

* Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.
* Since she took the bus 7 times, that's a total of $8 * 7 = $56.
* Her hotel stay for 3 nights cost $80 * 3 = $240.

Adding those together, her total trip cost was $240 + $56 = $296.

"Let's figure out how many hot dogs John needs! He's got 20 guests coming, and they'll each eat 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  

He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more. Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2, so his total cost will be 6 * $2 = $12.

"That sounds like a fun, chaotic scene!  Let's see... 

They start with 5 kids, then each gets a friend, so that's 5 times 2, or 10 kids. Then they each get TWO more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so 20 minus 5 is... 15 kids left.

"Let's figure out how much Jake spends!

* Those T-shirts are a great deal!  Since he gets one half off, each shirt costs $4. That's $8 for the two of them.
* The shoes are also on sale, so $40 minus $16 is $24.

Adding the cost of the shirts and shoes, Jake spends $8 + $24 = $36.

"Let's figure this out! Ryan earned $6 a week for 3 weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $1.25 each, and he bought 4, so that's $1.25 * 4 = $5.00.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets are $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"That's easy!  

Here's how to figure out Tim's profit:

Each jar costs $44 to make ($12 for passion fruit + $12 for jackfruit + $20 for honey). Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar ($50 - $44 = $6).

Selling 10 jars, he'd make a total profit of $60 ($6/jar * 10 jars = $60).

"Let's break down Janet's spending:

* Two movie tickets cost $7.50 each, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00.
* In total, she spent $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If she started with $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Let's count those cookies!

Randy starts with 18 cookies. After his snack, he has 16 left. Then he eats 2 more, leaving him with 14.  Giving away 2 sugar cookies brings his total down to 12. Finally, baking more cookies brings his total up to 24!


24 

"
"That's easy!  Let's see... half of 12 is 6, and 6 times $5 is $30. The other 6 toys would earn him 6 times $7, which is $42.  Adding those together, he'd make $72.

"Igor must have lost 0 beakers.  

Here's how I figured it out:

* He was supposed to get 16 test tubes, but only got 8.
* He got 16 Petri dishes, which is 2 more than he needed.
* That means he had 8 + 16 = 24 items, and he needed 37 total.
* Since he only had 29 on the bench, he must have lost 37 - 29 = 8 items.
* But he only lost test tubes, because he got the right number of beakers!

"Let's figure this out!  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table.  He's building 4 tables, so he needs 8 * 4 = 32 screws. Since he has 40 screws, he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that distance, or 2 miles. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, he completed his 2 miles in the same amount of time Vanessa took to run 1 mile.  If Aaron finished in 16 minutes, that means Vanessa took 16 minutes to run 1 mile.  Therefore, she took 16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"This is a classic problem!  Let's see... 

If we think about it, each cow has 4 legs and each chicken has 2.  We know there are 70 legs in total.  

Let's try some combinations. If there were 10 cows, that would be 40 legs. That leaves 30 legs for the chickens, which would mean there are 15 chickens (30 / 2 = 15). But that's 25 animals total, not 20!

Hmm, let's try fewer cows. If there were 5 cows, that's 20 legs. That leaves 50 legs for the chickens, which means there would be 25 chickens (50 / 2 = 25).  That's too many animals again!

Let's try something in between. How about 5 cows? That's 20 legs. That leaves 50 legs for the chickens, which means there would be 25 chickens.  

Aha! 5 cows and 15 chickens make a total of 20 animals and 70 legs.
