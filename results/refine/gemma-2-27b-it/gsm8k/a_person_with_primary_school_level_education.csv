"Janet has 16 eggs, and she uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins. That's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.

She has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18.

"Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then $50,000 fixing it up. That's $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, so it's worth $80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000 more!

That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000!

"Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of food each, every day.  She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

She has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, so she needs 20 x 3 = 60 cups in total.

So she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 more cups in the last meal.

"Okay, so Kylar wants 16 glasses.  That's like 8 pairs of glasses. Each pair has one glass for $5 and one for $3, so each pair costs $8.  If he buys 8 pairs, that's 8 times $8, which is $64.

"Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times more sheep than Seattle, so Charleston has 20 x 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep.  

If you add them all up, they have 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Okay, so Carla was downloading a big file, like a super big movie! It was 200 GB, that's a lot! She downloads 2 GB every minute, which is pretty fast.

But then, the computer said ""update time!"" and it took 20 minutes.  That's a bummer! She had already downloaded 80 GB, but now she has to start all over.

So, she downloads the first 80 GB again, that takes 40 minutes. Then she has to download the rest, which is 120 GB, and that takes another 60 minutes.

Let's add it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

So it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the whole movie.

"John drove 180 miles going to where he was going. Then he had to turn around and go back home. He was stuck in traffic for a long time, so he didn't go very far for a while.  He drove a little bit faster later, but he was still far from home.  I think he was 45 miles away from home at the end.

"Eliza works 40 hours for $10 each hour. That's 40 times 10, which is $400.

She worked 5 extra hours, and those hours pay more! They pay $12 each. So that's 5 times 12, which is $60.

Now we add the two amounts: $400 plus $60 is $460.

"Okay, so the program got 60 downloads the first month. Then it got three times that much the next month, which is 60 times 3, that's 180! But then the third month it went down by 30, so we gotta take 30 away from 180. That's 150.  

Now we add all the downloads together: 60 + 180 + 150 = 390 downloads!

"Okay, let's see...

* Donuts cost 68 dollars for every group of 12, and she got 3 groups, so that's 68 times 3 which is 204 dollars.
* Cupcakes are 80 dollars for a group of 12, and she got 2 groups, so that's 80 times 2 which is 160 dollars.
* Cheesecakes are 55 dollars for a group of 12, and she got 6 groups, so that's 55 times 6 which is 330 dollars.

Now, let's add all that up: 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 dollars.

"Okay, so the tree costs $90 at first.  Then every year he makes $10.50 from selling lemons but spends $3.00 to take care of it. So that means he makes $7.50 more each year.

"Melanie sold some vacuum cleaners.  She sold one-third at the green house, then 2 more at the red house.  She sold half of the rest at the orange house and had 5 left.  

Let's see... if she had 5 left, and that's half of what she had before the orange house, then she had 5 x 2 = 10 before the orange house.

Before the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12.

And before the green house, she had 12 x 3 = 36.


So Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners. 

**Answer:** 36

"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class.  Some like to dance contemporary, that's 20% of them, so that's 4 kids. Then some like jazz, that's 25% of the kids who are left, so that's another 4 kids.  That means 12 kids like hip-hop!  

So, 12 out of 20 kids like hip-hop. That's 60%!

"If the book cost $19.50 after a discount, that means it was cheaper than the first price.  

If it was 25% off, that means it was 75% of the original price.

To find the original price, we can think of it like this:

* 75% is the same as 3 out of 4 parts.
* If $19.50 is 3 parts, we need to figure out what 1 part is.

We can divide $19.50 by 3: $19.50 / 3 = $6.50

Then, to find the whole price (all 4 parts), we multiply $6.50 by 4: $6.50 x 4 = $26.00

* Shoes cost $42 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 x $42 = $126.00

If their total age is 162, that means each slice is worth 9 years (162 / 18 = 9).

Allen has 11 slices, so he's 99 years old (11 x 9 = 99).

In 10 years, Allen will be 109 years old (99 + 10 = 109).

* The second friend says 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.
* The third friend says 25% more than 80. That's like a quarter of 80, which is 20. So 20 more than 80 is 100.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are three friends: 240 / 3 = 80.

"John walks each dog for half an hour every day.  That's like 30 minutes.  He has 10 dogs, so that's 30 times 10, which is 300 minutes a day!  There are 7 days in a week, so he spends 300 times 7 minutes walking dogs, which is 2100 minutes.  

To figure out how many hours that is, we need to know how many minutes are in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 2100 by 60. That's 35 hours!

"Let's see... Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  Hmm... that means if we take away 30 from the total, we'll know how many silver coins she has.

110 - 30 = 80

So she has 80 silver coins.  

Now, to find the gold coins, we add the extra 30 back:

Gretchen has 70 gold coins!

"John sold his Lego sets to buy video games. He had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each. That's 13 times 15, which is $195! He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so that's 8 times 20, which is $160.  He had $5 left over, so before buying games he had $160 plus $5, which is $165.

He sold enough Lego sets to make $165, so he sold $165 divided by $15 per set, which is 11 Lego sets.

If he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 minus 11, which is 2 Lego sets left.

She runs for 2 hours out of the 6 hours, so she runs 6 times 2 which is 12 miles.

You can only eat part of a serving because you only have 200 calories left.  200 calories divided by 250 calories per serving is 0.8 servings.

He also sells 23 cheesecakes, so that's 23 times $4, which is $92.  If we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes, he makes $129 + $92 = $221.

"Let's see... Shiela bought 5 phones for $150 each, so that's 5 times 150... which is 750 dollars.  

But there's also interest! It's 2% of each phone, so that's like 2 dollars for every 100 dollars.  

Hmm, 2% of 150 is 3 dollars for each phone.  And since she bought 5 phones, the interest is 3 times 5, which is 15 dollars.

So, all together it's 750 plus 15, which is 765 dollars.

Now, she pays for 3 months, so we divide 765 by 3... that's 255 dollars each month!

"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for $3, petunias for $2, and begonias for $2.

He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 times $3, which is $36.

He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 times $2, which is $18.

He sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 times $2, which is $34.

Now we add it all up: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"Okay, so Luke's sandcastle gets smaller on top. The top is 16 squares. Then the one under it is double that, so it's 32 squares!  The next one is double 32, so that's 64 squares. And the bottom one is double 64, which is 128 squares.

If we add all those up, it's 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 squares.

Since there are 4 levels, we divide the total squares by 4: 240 / 4 = 60 squares.

So each level has an average of 60 squares.

"Okay, so the puppy eats 1 cup of food a day for 180 days. That's 180 cups of food! Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year.  There are 365 days in a year, so that's 185 days left.  

That's 185 days times 2 cups a day, which is 370 cups.

So in total, the puppy eats 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Each bag has 110 cups, so Cecilia needs 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags of food.

"Sarah washes lots of clothes, 400 pounds! Raymond washes half as much as Sarah, so he washes 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. David washes way less, only 1/4 of what Sarah washes, so he washes 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

Raymond washes 200 - 100 = 100 more pounds than David.

"Let's see... Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds. So, 4 times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 pounds = 500 pounds.  Then we take away 2 pounds: 500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds.

If the walls are 1 inch thick, that means we take 1 inch away from each side. So, the inside is 3 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall.

To find the space inside one box, we multiply: 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since he has three boxes, we multiply that by 3: 24 cubic inches/box x 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

So far, that's 5 + 0.5 = 5.5 hours.

"Okay, so Adrien made $40000 four years ago, and that was 30% more than Lylah.  

To find out how much Lylah made, we can think of it like this: if Adrien's money is 130% (100% + 30%), then Lylah's money is 100%.

So, we divide Adrien's money by 1.3 to find Lylah's money: $40000 / 1.3 = $30769.23 (about).

Now, Adrien's money went up by 40%, so we add 40% of $40000 to his old money: $40000 * 0.40 = $16000.

That means Adrien makes $40000 + $16000 = $56000 now.

Lylah's money also went up by 40%, so we add 40% of $30769.23 to her old money: $30769.23 * 0.40 = $12307.69 (about).

That means Lylah makes $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43076.92 now.

He can pick them every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year. So he picks them 12 divided by 3, which is 4 times a year.

If he gets 1000 pineapples each time, and he picks them 4 times, he gets 1000 times 4, which is 4000 pineapples in a whole year!


4000 

"
"Wow, that's a lot of Legos! 

Let's see... the first box has 500 pieces. The second box has three times that, so it has 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces.  The last box has a quarter of the pieces in the first box, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

If he picks up all the pieces, that's 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces!

"Okay, so Debra saw 30 bees fly out at first. Then 15 bees came back.  Then lots more bees flew out, twice as many as the first time, so that's 30 times 2 which is 60 bees!  

That means a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees flew out during the day.  

All those bees came back at the end, so 90 bees came back to the hive.

"Brittany's mom paid for one big person ticket and one kid ticket. The big person ticket costs $12 and the kid ticket costs $10. That's $12 + $10 = $22.

"Okay, so Steve bikes 3 miles and Tim goes 2 miles.  Steve goes faster, so he'll get home first.  Let's see... Steve goes 440 feet every minute, and Tim goes 264 feet every minute.  Hmm, that's a lot of feet!  

Steve has to go farther, so he'll be riding for a bit longer than Tim.  I think Steve will have to wait a few minutes for Tim to get home.

"Shawnda got 25 cents for each tire.  She did 10 bike tires, 9 tricycle tires, and 1 unicycle tire. That's 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires!

That's the same as 5 dollars!

"Carl has 10 packs of cookies and each pack has 6 cookies, so he has 10 times 6 which is 60 cookies.  Each cookie costs 10 cents, so 60 cookies cost 60 times 10 cents which is $6.00. If he pays with a $10 bill, he gets $4.00 back.

"Dave had a lot of fries!  Let's see... he ate 14, and the seagull ate half of that, which is 7. So together they ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries. Then the pigeons came and ate some, 3 each, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 fries gone.  That leaves 21 - 9 = 12 fries. The raccoon was sneaky and took most of the rest, two-thirds of them, which is like 12 / 3 = 4 fries.  That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 fries.  But then the ants got one, so there were 8 - 1 = 7 fries left.  

So Dave must have started with 7 fries! 



"
"Kimo has class a lot! Let's see...

He has three classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 times 1 hour, which is 3 hours each day.  So that's 3 hours times 3 days, which is 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes that are 2 hours long. So that's 2 times 2, which is 4 hours each day. And then 4 times 2 days is 8 hours.

That means he has 9 hours plus 8 hours, which is 17 hours of class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester, so he has 17 times 16, which is 272 hours of class in a semester!

"Let's see... Bill makes a lot of yummy treats!

* He makes 300 rolls, and each one is 4 inches long. So that's 300 times 4, which is 1200 inches!

* He makes 120 croissants, and they're 6 inches each. That's 120 times 6, which is 720 inches.

* The baguettes are tricky because they're 2 feet long.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 times 12, which is 24 inches long.

* He makes 60 baguettes, so that's 60 times 24, which is 1440 inches.

* Now we add up all the inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

* But we want to know how long it is in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 3360 by 12. That's 280 feet!

"Let's see... the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100.  That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

"Blake ran back and forth 15 times, so he ran 15 times 100 yards which is 1500 yards!

Kelly ran back and forth once, that's 100 yards. Then she ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.  That's like running 80 yards each time, so 34 times 80 yards is 2720 yards.  

So Kelly ran 100 yards + 2720 yards which is 2820 yards!

Kelly ran 2820 yards and Blake ran 1500 yards, so Kelly ran 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther.

"Okay, so the marbles start at $20.  Then they go up by $4 every two months.  

Let's see... 36 months is like 18 groups of two months. So the price goes up $4 eighteen times!

That's not 28! Let's try a bigger number for Brooke. If Brooke is 8, Seth is 16.

In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18.

10 + 18 = 28!

* And the mutant ones have 10 legs each, and there are 3 of them, so that's 10 times 3, which is 30 legs.

She wants to pay extra, like half again as much, so that's $1000 times 0.50 which is $500 more.

So she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500 every month.

In a year, that's $1500 times 12 months, which is $18000.

Peeling each one takes a minute and a half, so that's like 90 minutes for all of them. Cutting is faster, only 5 seconds each. That's 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes.

So, peeling takes 90 minutes and cutting takes 5 minutes.  That means it takes him 95 minutes to do it all.

"Lemonade costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so that's $3 + $2 = $5 for each big jug.

They sell each cup for 50 cents, and they get 20 cups from one jug. That means they make 20 * $0.50 = $10 for each jug.

They made $25 profit, and each jug makes them $10 - $5 = $5 profit. So they sold $25 / $5 = 5 jugs.

They spent $3 on lemons for each jug, and they sold 5 jugs, so they spent $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

If you add those up, 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The fast team finished in 220 seconds and the other team took 222 seconds.  That means the fast team won by 2 seconds!

Hmm, that's tricky!  If we try starting with a small number of red chickens, like 2, that wouldn't be enough eggs.  Maybe 4 red chickens?  

Let's see, 4 red chickens lay 12 eggs (4 x 3 = 12). That leaves 30 eggs to come from the white chickens (42 - 12 = 30).

If he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, that's 6 white chickens (4 + 2 = 6).  And 6 white chickens lay 30 eggs (6 x 5 = 30).

"On the first day, Sloane saw 100 people. The next day she saw 50 more than that, so she saw 100 + 50 = 150 people.  That's 100 + 150 = 250 people in two days.

If she saw 500 people in total, then on the third day she saw 500 - 250 = 250 people.

"Okay, so the big pool is losing water just like the small pool, right?  They both lose 4 gallons every minute.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much! That means the big pool is losing water faster, even though they both lose the same amount each minute.

Hmm, that's tricky.  Let's see... if the small pool has ""S"" amount of water now, the big pool has ""4S"" because it has four times as much.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool, so it had ""2S"" more water.  

Since they both lose 4 gallons every minute, the big pool lost 16 gallons in those four minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons).

So, four minutes ago, the big pool had ""4S + 16"" gallons.

And four minutes ago, the small pool had ""S + 16"" gallons.

We know that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool, so:

4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)

Let's solve that!

4S + 16 = 2S + 32

2S = 16

S = 8


So the small pool has 8 gallons now!

"Janeth borrowed money and has to pay extra. She pays a little bit each month.  After a whole year of paying, she still owes some money.  Let's see how much!

She borrowed $2000 and has to pay 10% more, so that's $200 extra.

That means she has to pay back $2000 + $200 = $2200 in total.

If she pays $165 every month for 12 months, she pays $165 * 12 = $1980.

So, she still owes $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times older, so Adrian is 21 times 3 which is 63. Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so he is 21 times 2 which is 42.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  If you add those ages together, you get 135.  To find the average, you divide by 3, and 135 divided by 3 is 45.

"Let's see... Naomi got 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so that's 68 divided by 2, which is 34, plus 10 more, so Yuri got 44 points. Brianna got 17 more points than Naomi, so she got 68 plus 17, which is 85 points.  

If we add up Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's points, we get 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

To find out how many points Jojo got, we subtract the other players' points from the total points: 251 - 197 = 54 points.

That's $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00

He wants chips and a drink too, so that's $3.00 more. Now it's $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00

Then he has to pay extra money because of taxes. That's 10% of $240,000, which is $24,000.

So now the cars cost $240,000 plus $24,000, which is $264,000.

But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 for each car to get them registered. That's 12 times $1000, which is $12,000.

She needs it done 4 times a week, so that's $1500 times 4, which is $6000 every week!

The movie takes 5 weeks, so that's $6000 times 5, which is $30,000!

But the makeup lady gives Jean a discount because it was so much makeup. It's 10% off, so that's $3000 off!

Each cookie has 200 calories, so we need to multiply the number of cookies by 200 to find the total calories.

Let's see... Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

That's 46 * 200 = 9200 calories!

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

That's 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The paper work costs 12%, so that's $350,000 divided by 100, then times 12. That's $42,000.

That means the house really costs $350,000 plus $59,500, which is $409,500.

So, to find out how much money he has left, we add up all the money he had to pay: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

"A cobra has lots of spots! It has 70, which is double the spots a mamba has. A mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras, so they have 40 * 70 = 2800 spots all together.

There are 60 mambas, so they have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

That means all the snakes have 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots!

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed a lot of people! Let's see... 12 players plus 3 coaches is 15 people. Then there are 24 guests, so that's 15 plus 24, which is 39 people.

Each pizza has enough for 3 people, so she needs 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas.

If each pizza costs $15, then 13 pizzas will cost 13 times $15, which is $195.

"Let's see... Katerina uses 8 topaz stones, and each one is 1 inch long. So that's 8 inches of topaz. Her necklaces are 25 inches long, so that means the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each little bead is 1/4 of an inch.  So to find out how many beads she uses, we do 17 inches / 0.25 inches per bead = 68 beads.

"Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

In the second week, they all wrote double the stories! So Alani wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

That's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

 Altogether, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories!

"Let's see... Kelly has five quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So that's 5 times 25, which is 125 cents.  She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents. So that's 2 times 10, which is 20 cents.

Now, let's add up all her money: 125 cents plus 20 cents is 145 cents.

The pop costs 55 cents, so we need to take that away from her total: 145 cents minus 55 cents is 90 cents.

"Let's count the stars!

There are 3 rows with 8 stars, so that's 3 times 8, which is 24 stars.

Then there are 2 rows with 6 stars, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 stars.

That means there are 24 plus 12, which is 36 stars in those rows.

We have 76 stars total, so there are 76 minus 36, which is 40 stars left.

Those 40 stars are in rows of 5, so there are 40 divided by 5, which is 8 rows.

"Wow, that's a lot of flagstones!  

Let's see... each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone is 75 pounds.  So, 80 flagstones weigh 80 times 75, which is 6000 pounds.

That means they need 6000 divided by 2000, which is 3 trucks.

"The fast car goes 60 miles every hour. The slow car goes half as fast, so it goes 30 miles every hour.

If the fast car goes 480 miles, it takes 8 hours because 480 / 60 = 8.

Let's add up all the crates he sold: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

He wanted to sell 120 and he sold 65, so let's see how many more he needed: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates away from his goal.

"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, that's 60 miles every day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5, which is 300 miles every week.

He works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 times 50, which is 15,000 miles a year.

Each mile costs $2, so that's 15,000 times 2, which is $30,000.

He also gives his driver $150 extra every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's 150 times 12, which is $1,800.

The other programmers are senior programmers, so there are 60 of them (100 - 40 = 60).

Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers, so they get $2400 each ($2000 + $400 = $2400).

So all the senior programmers get $144,000 together (60 x $2400 = $144,000).

Job B is a little trickier. It's $42,000 straight up, but then they take out $6,000 for something called property tax. That leaves $36,000. Then they take out 10% for more taxes, so that's $36,000 times 0.10, which is $3,600. So Job B is $36,000 minus $3,600, which is $32,400.

Let's see... if he has twice as many chickens as cows, maybe we can try guessing. If he had 20 cows, that would be 40 chickens (20 x 2 = 40).  

That's 60 animals in total!

Now, let's count the legs:

If we add up the weight of all the animals, we get 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

"Andrea had $36. She bought a sweater for $11 and gave her brother $4.  

To find out how much she saved, we need to add the cost of the sweater and the money she gave her brother: $11 + $4 = $15

Then we subtract that from the money she started with: $36 - $15 = $21

"John boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, so he swam for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours of boating, swimming, and shows.

That's 30% of his whole vacation!  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She has $80 already.  

She makes $10 an hour at her first job and worked 20 hours, so she earned $10 x 20 = $200.

At her second job, she makes $5 an hour and worked 15 hours, so she earned $5 x 15 = $75.

That means she made $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Now she has $275 + $80 = $355.

She still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

Over 5 days, she saves $4.00 x 5 = $20.00

"Carver is 45, and that's 5 years less than double his son's age.  So double his son's age is 45 + 5, which is 50.  If double his son's age is 50, then his son is 50 / 2 = 25 years old.

"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles then 100 miles, that's 175 miles. Then it goes back 50 miles less, so that's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

So going all the way around is 175 + 125 = 300 miles.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 x 3 = 900 miles a day!

It needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much all the senior gifts cost.

The picture frames cost $20 each, and there are 44 seniors, so that's 44 times 20, which is $880.

Each frame also needs to be etched, and that costs 20% more.  20% of 20 is 4 dollars, so each frame costs $4 more to etch.

That means etching all the frames costs 44 times 4, which is $176.

Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so those cost 2 times 5, which is $10.

One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 divided by 4, which is 11 officers.

Each officer gets a cord that costs $12, so those cost 11 times 12, which is $132.

Now we add up all the costs: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"Okay, so Karan borrowed some money, right? She has to pay it back with extra money called interest.  

Let's see... she borrowed $3650 and has to pay 10% extra. That's like if you had 10 dimes and had to give 1 more dime, that's 10%.

So, the extra money she has to pay is $365.  

Now, she has to pay back the money she borrowed plus the extra money over 5 months. That means she has to pay $3650 + $365 = $4015 in total.

If she pays the same amount each month, it's $4015 / 5 = $803 each month.

To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we need to subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance. 112 minus 45 is 67.

"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. That's a lot of pesos! His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos, so she has 50 x 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

To find out how many pesos they have together, we need to add up all the silver pesos and all the gold pesos.

Axel's silver + Anna's silver = 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos.

Axel's gold + Anna's gold = 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Now, let's add all the pesos together: 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.

"Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher has 12 cups, so she has 3 times 12, which is 36 cups of lemonade.

She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all the lemonade, she makes $36.

But she spent $18 on stuff to make the lemonade, so she makes $36 - $18 = $18 profit.

She sells 4 cups every hour, and she has 36 cups, so she's open for 36 divided by 4, which is 9 hours.

So, she makes $18 profit every 9 hours, which means she makes $18 divided by 9 = $2 profit every hour.

Betty has 5 groups of popsicles, so she has 75 popsicles (5 x 15 = 75).

Sam has 6 groups of popsicles, so he has 90 popsicles (6 x 15 = 90).

Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty (90 - 75 = 15).

She started with 20 cards and her dad gave her 2 boxes with 15 cards in each box. That's 2 boxes * 15 cards = 30 cards!

So she had 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

She gave 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, so she gave away 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

The last zebra has half the stripes of the one with 36, so it has 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

In total, all the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes per zebra.

Meat costs $7.00 a pound, so 5 pounds costs 5 times $7.00, which is $35.00.

Cheese costs $3.00 a pound, so 5 pounds costs 5 times $3.00, which is $15.00.

"Let's see... they have 4 big buses that can hold lots of people, 60 in each! That's 4 times 60, which is 240 people.

Then there are smaller buses, 6 of them, and each holds 30 people. So that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people.

And lastly, there are 10 little vans that hold 15 people each. That's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

Now, let's add them all up: 240 + 180 + 150 equals 570 people!

"Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  That's 6 bird feeders in total!

Her homemade feeders are super popular and get 20 birds each plus 10 extra birds, so that's 30 birds at each one!

So her homemade feeders get 30 birds x 3 feeders = 90 birds.

The store-bought ones get 20 birds each, so that's 20 birds x 3 feeders = 60 birds.

In total, Lillian sees 90 birds + 60 birds = 150 birds!

"Kenny wants to go to the amusement park. The ticket costs $100, and he has $50 left over after buying it. That means he made $50 from selling his cards.

He sells each card for $1.50, so he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33 cards.

He kept some cards, and 33 cards is only two-thirds of all his cards.  If 33 cards is two-thirds, then one-third is 33 / 2 = 16.5 cards.

That means he had 33 + 16.5 = 49.5 cards. You can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards!

To find the width, we can do 360 divided by 9, which is 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides. It's like walking all the way around the room! So, 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

Each pack has 20 beads, so Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads.

Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 beads - 60 beads = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

But then he opens the window, and it gets colder. It gets 2 degrees colder every 10 minutes, and the window is open for 30 minutes. That's 30 / 10 = 3 times it gets colder.

He sold those for $25 each, so that's 31 times $25, which is $775.

Now let's add up all the money he made: $340 plus $775 is $1115.

"Okay, so the car goes fast for a while, then slower. To find the average, we gotta think about how far it went in total and how long it took.

It went 60 miles an hour for 2 hours, so that's 60 x 2 = 120 miles.

Then it went 30 miles an hour for 1 hour, so that's 30 x 1 = 30 miles.

In total, it went 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It drove for 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

So, to find the average speed, we do 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.

"Paul drives twice a day, so that's like driving one time in the morning and one time in the afternoon.  

He drives for 14 days, so that's 14 times he drives in the morning and 14 times he drives in the afternoon.

Each morning drive costs $6 and each afternoon drive costs $2. So, one whole day of driving costs $6 + $2 = $8.

If one day costs $8, then 14 days cost $8 x 14 = $112.

"
"Ashley brought a lot of oranges! She had 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. That's 5 times 10, which is 50 oranges! Brianne brought even more, 20 more than Ashley. So she had 50 plus 20, which is 70 oranges.  

Together they have 50 plus 70, which is 120 oranges.  Each pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 divided by 3, which is 40 pies!

"
"If the first place costs $200 plus $5 for each person, and the second place costs $25 for each person, we need to figure out when they cost the same.

Let's try some numbers!

* If 10 people come, the first place costs $200 + ($5 x 10) = $250. The second place costs $25 x 10 = $250.

So, if 10 people come, both places cost the same!

"Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, and her grandma used half. That's like Mariah using 1 piece out of 4 and grandma using 2 pieces out of 4.  

So together they used 1 + 2 = 3 pieces out of 4.

A whole skein has 364 yards, so they used 3/4 of that.

3/4 of 364 yards is 273 yards.

"Let's count the gifts!

Two of Cherrie's friends want five gifts each, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts.

Three friends want two gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.

That's 10 plus 6, which is 16 gifts.

But wait, she buys 10 more! So 16 plus 10 is 26 gifts.

"Mario has 6 dogs and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. So that's 6 times 4, which is 24 snowshoes.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, and he needs 24 snowshoes, so that's 24 times $12.00.  

24 times 12 is 288.

"Let's count all the animals!

The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so that's 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

"Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. That's a lot!  To lose one pound, he needs to burn 3500 extra calories. So to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn 30 times that much, which is 105,000 calories!

He has until July, which is a long time. Let's say there are about 200 days until then.

If he wants to lose all that weight, he needs to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories every day!

"The house cost $90,000. 



"
"Tara bought lots of bags! She got 8 packs, and each pack had 5 bags. That's 8 times 5, which is 40 bags!

Each bag cost $4, so all the bags cost 40 times $4, which is $160.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 times $8, which is $320.

To find out how much money she made, we subtract the cost from the money she earned: $320 - $160 = $160.

Tara made $160 profit!

"Joe throws a lot of punches! He throws 25 punches every minute.  A fight has 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, he throws punches for 5 times 3, which is 15 minutes.

"
"Ali has four ten dollar bills, so that's 4 times 10 which is $40. He also has six twenty dollar bills, so that's 6 times 20 which is $120.  

That means he has $40 + $120 = $160 in total.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives her $160 / 2 = $80.

Now he has $160 - $80 = $80 left.

He spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is $80 times 3/5, which is $48.

So, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left.

* A scarf takes 4 balls of wool.
* A sweater takes 12 balls of wool, that's a lot!
* Mittens take 1 ball of wool.
* And socks take 2 balls of wool.

So for each kid, that's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 balls of wool.

Since she has 3 grandkids, she needs 21 x 3 = 63 balls of wool.

"Chris did 12 problems on Monday and 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 x 3 = 36 problems.

That's 12 + 36 = 48 problems done already.

He had 100 problems to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he did 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

"Let's see... Jackson has lots of tulips! He puts 6 red ones in each row, and he has 36 red tulips. So that's 36 divided by 6, which is 6 rows of red tulips.

He puts 8 blue tulips in each row, and he has 24 blue tulips. So that's 24 divided by 8, which is 3 rows of blue tulips.

To find the total, we add the red rows and the blue rows: 6 plus 3 is 9.

"
"Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to share them equally for cookies, granola, and snack mix. That means each thing gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.  To see how many batches she can make, we can do 9 / (3/4) = 12 batches.

"Ada uses 12 powers a day and each power costs $1.50. So she spends 12 times $1.50 which is $18.00 every day.

The new thing uses 2 more powers, so now she uses 12 + 2 = 14 powers a day.

That's 14 times $1.50 = $21.00 every day.

She spends $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00 more each day.

In a week, that's $3.00 times 7 days = $21.00 more.

"If 1 person paints half a house in 5 days, that means they paint a little bit each day.  If we have 5 people helping, they can paint much faster!  They'll finish the whole house in 2 days.

"Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 more chairs than sofas, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 x 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Together they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

Together they have 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

That means they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs altogether.

Let's add it all up: 4 hours x 6 weeks = 24 hours
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours

"The computer cost $1100 and the printer cost $700 less, so the printer cost $1100 - $700 = $400.

That means the computer and printer together cost $1100 + $400 = $1500.

He spent $2400 in total, and $1500 of that was on the computer and printer, so the two monitors cost $2400 - $1500 = $900.

If one monitor cost the same as the other, then one monitor cost $900 / 2 = $450.

He wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first half.  April has 30 days, so that's 15 days in each half.

To save half his money in the first half, he needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half.

If he saves the same amount each day in the second half, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day.

"Let's see... Verna bought three apples for $1.50 each, so that's 3 times $1.50, which is $4.50.  Then she got five oranges at $0.80 each, so that's 5 times $0.80, which is $4.00. And six peaches at $0.75 each is 6 times $0.75, which is $4.50.

So all together, her fruit cost $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

If he swims 3 miles in cold water, it takes him 16 times 3, which is 48 minutes.

In warm water, 3 miles would take him 34 times 3, which is 102 minutes.

So each sandwich costs $3.30 to make. They sell each one for $7.00, so they make $3.70 for each sandwich. If they sell 10, they make $3.70 times 10, which is $37.00!

"Okay, so Michael needs new carpet for his room. His room is 18 feet long and 12 feet wide, so that's 18 times 12 which is 216 squares.

The carpet costs $12 for each square, so that's 216 times 12, which is $2592.

He also needs padding, which is $2 for each square, so that's 216 times 2, which is $432.

Taking out the old carpet costs $4 per square, so that's 216 times 4, which is $864.

Putting the new carpet in costs $34 per square, so that's 216 times 34, which is $7344.

Now we add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

"Okay, so Mack saw birds for a whole week. Let's add up all the birds he saw: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

If she wants it to be 520, we gotta figure out how much hotter it'll be.  Hmm... 18 degrees hotter out of 450 is kinda like... a little bit more than 4% hotter.

So, 520 is bigger than 450, so it'll be even MORE than 18 degrees hotter.  Let's see... 520 times 4%... that's like 20 something degrees hotter.

So, she should probably set it to like 499 degrees, I think.

"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in one box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each day he uses 2 contacts.  

If he buys two boxes, he has 180 contacts (90 x 2).  

Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off, so each box costs $90 (100 - 10).

Two boxes cost $180 (90 x 2).

"Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.

On Sunday, John worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours.

That means John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Jill made 3 * $10 = $30.

John made 7 * $10 = $70.

John made $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Hannah burns lots of calories exercising!  She burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours. So that's 500 times 2, which is 1000 calories! Then she runs for 1 hour and burns 600 calories doing that.  

So in total, she burns 1000 plus 600, which is 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories. So we need to see how many times 200 goes into 1600.  That's 1600 divided by 200, which is 8.

So Hannah needs to drink 8 times 100 ml, which is 800 ml of water.

"Okay, so there are lots of jelly beans!

If we think of the blue ones as 100, the red ones are 99, and the green ones are 101.

That means there are 2 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans for every 100 blue jelly beans.

Since there are lots of jelly beans, we can say there are about 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans in the whole jar.

"If Martin eats Cheerios he loses weight, and if he eats donuts he gains weight.  Let's see how much he changes after 5 weeks.

With Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds each week, so in 5 weeks he loses 1.25 x 5 = 6.25 pounds.

With donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds each week, so in 5 weeks he gains 1.75 x 5 = 8.75 pounds.

That means he'd be 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds heavier if he eats donuts.

He already paid $600, so he needs $4500 minus $600, which is $3900 more.

"Okay, so the car goes 2 miles and the tires turn 725 times.  If Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's like doing 2 miles a bunch of times!  

Let's see... 400 miles / 2 miles = 200 times the tires go around.

So, the tires turn 200 times * 725 times each = 145,000 times every month!

The tire can turn 10,440,000 times before it's done.

So, 10,440,000 times / 145,000 times a month = 72 months.

There are 12 months in a year, so 72 months / 12 months a year = 6 years.

The shorts are $35, and they're also 30% off, so they're cheaper by $10.50. That means the shorts cost $24.50.

Now we add that to the starting price: $30000 + $13500 = $43500

"Okay, so Tim gets more money now!

First, his raise is 5% of $20,000.  That's like finding 5 out of every 100 dollars.  So, 5% of $20,000 is $1000 more each month!

Now he makes $20,000 + $1000 = $21,000 each month.

He also gets a bonus of half his old salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000!

So, every month he makes $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000!

In a whole year, that's $31,000 x 12 = $372,000!

$372000

"Okay, so James buys lots of clothes!

He gets 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.  That's a lot of money!  So 10 times $750 is... $7500!

The pants are cheaper, they cost $150 each. He buys 10 of those too, so that's 10 times $150, which is $1500.

He also gets 3 shirts for every suit, so that's 10 suits times 3 shirts, which is 30 shirts! Each shirt costs $60, so 30 times $60 is... $1800.

Now we add up all the prices: $7500 + $1500 + $1800.  That's a total of $10800!

"Ariadne sold red hats for $400, and that was only half the money she made from green hats! So green hats made her $400 x 2 = $800.

That means in the first month she made $400 + $800 = $1200 from all the hats.

The next month she made a little less, only three-quarters of what she made the first month. So she made $1200 x (3/4) = $900.

Altogether, in two months she made $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Wow, that's a fancy plane!  

Okay, so the plane costs $150,000 at first. Then he pays $5000 each month for the hanger, and double that for gas, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10,000 for gas.

That means every month he spends $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

In a whole year, that's $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

So, all together it costs him $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000 for the first year.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds, which cost $2, and a third of a pound of walnuts, which cost $5. That mix costs $7 total.

If we take the cost of the first mix and take away the cost of the second mix, we get $10 - $7 = $3.

"Lee has sheep and geese. They have 70 legs all together.  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2. There are 20 heads in total. How many sheep does Lee have?

Hmm, let's see... If we have 20 heads, that means we have 20 animals.  

If all the animals were sheep, they'd have 80 legs (20 animals x 4 legs each). That's too many legs!

So, some must be geese. Geese have 2 legs, so they have fewer legs than sheep.

Let me try guessing. What if Lee has 15 sheep? That's 60 legs (15 sheep x 4 legs).

Then he'd need 5 geese to make 20 animals.  Geese have 10 legs (5 geese x 2 legs).

That's 70 legs in total!  

So Lee has 15 sheep.

"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer. She made it 50% longer, which is like half as long again. Then she added 20cm of lace.  

If the dress is 140cm long now, we need to take away the lace first. That leaves us with 120cm.

Now, since she made it 50% longer, that means 120cm is 150% of the original length.  

To find the original length, we can think of it like this: if 150% is 120cm, then 100% (the original length) is a bit smaller.

We can divide 120cm by 1.5 to find the original length.

120cm / 1.5 = 80cm

If he buys 10 lollipops, that's 10 times 40 cents, which is $4.00.

Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 candies left.

Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 candies left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more candies than Ginger!

"Okay, so Mr. Boarden wants to put tiles on part of his bathroom floor.  He needs 24 tiles for every little square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he's only doing two-thirds of it.

Let's see... two-thirds of 36 is like cutting the bathroom into three parts and using two of them. That's 24 square feet!

Now, he needs 24 tiles for each square foot, so for 24 square feet, he needs 24 times 24 tiles.  That's a lot of tiles!

"Picking blueberries is fun!  It cost $20 to go to the farm and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. James picked 30 pounds.  

At the store, blueberries cost $2.50 a pound.  

Let's see how much James saved.

* At the farm, 30 pounds cost $1.50 x 30 = $45.
* With the entry fee, it cost $45 + $20 = $65.
* At the store, 30 pounds cost $2.50 x 30 = $75.
* James saved $75 - $65 = $10!

"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each one. But then the computers got more expensive! They cost 10% more, which is like adding $70 to each one.

So now each computer costs $700 + $70 = $770.

To find out how much they paid in total, we do $770 times 500, which is $385,000.

"Helga taps her feet really fast!  

When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with one foot and 250 times with the other foot every minute. That's 300 + 250 = 550 taps every minute!

When her arms are up, she taps 200 times with each foot every minute, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 taps every minute.

She dances with her arms up for 2 minutes, so that's 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

In total, she taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times!

Bryce and two friends ate 2 out of every 3 slices, so they ate 2/3 of their pizzas. That's like 8 slices out of every pizza.  They ate 8 slices times 3 pizzas, which is 24 slices.

The other two friends ate 3 out of every 4 slices, so they ate 9 slices out of every pizza. They ate 9 slices times 2 pizzas, which is 18 slices.

So, they ate 24 plus 18 slices, which is 42 slices in total.

Let me try again. What if he bought 4 white fish? That would make 8 white fish and 13 orange fish. Nope, that's not twice as many orange.

Okay, let's try 3 more white fish. That would be 7 white fish and 14 orange fish.  That's it! Twice as many orange as white!

"Andy drives to work and back home every day. That's 5 miles to work plus 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 10 times 5, which is 50 miles a week.

His car uses 1 gallon for every 10 miles. So, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons a week.

Each gallon costs $3, so he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 a week on gas.

"Carrie got ten $20 bills, so that's 10 times 20 which is $200.  She also got 140 quarters.  That's 140 times 25 cents, which is $35.  She spent 3 of her 5 $20 bills, so that's 3 times $20, which is $60.  

So, she spent a total of $60 + $35 which is $95.

"Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each plant gives him 22 tomatoes. So that's 5 times 22, which is 110 tomatoes!

He also has 8 eggplant plants and each plant gives him 4 eggplants. So that's 8 times 4, which is 32 eggplants.

To find the total, we add the tomatoes and eggplants: 110 plus 32 equals 142 fruits.

Then she plays for 2 hours every day for a week, so that's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

In total, she played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours to get the achievement, so she still needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.

But there's extra money for making it! That's 30% of $900.  

30% is like 30 out of every 100, so we can do (30/100) * $900 = $270.

So the making cost is $270.

Now we add everything up: $900 + $270 = $1170

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many kids passed the test in total.

Third grade: 340 kids passed out of 500.

Fourth grade: 40 kids passed out of 100.

Fifth grade:  They did twice as good as fourth grade, so 40 times 2 is 80 kids passed.  

That's 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 kids who passed!

There are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 kids in total.

So, 460 out of 1000 passed. That's like 46 out of 100, which is 46%!

"Milo needs 12 chips for every inch of his mosaic.  He wants it to be 3 inches tall, so that's 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips just for one inch of the long part. He has 2 bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips.  

If he uses 36 chips for every inch, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"Okay, so they had 10 quarts left.  

Four kids drank 1.5 each, so that's 4 times 1.5 which is 6 quarts.

Then 16 kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 times 2 which is 32 quarts.

That means they drank 6 plus 32, which is 38 quarts.

So they started with 38 plus the 10 they have left, which is 48 quarts.

There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so they had 48 divided by 4, which is 12 gallons!

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters, and there are two of them, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

His good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

Hmm... let's see. If she uses the same amount of lemon peel and smelly stuff, and twice as much salt as lemon peel, that means she uses a lot of salt! And then she uses twice as much oil as salt, so she must use even more oil!

Let's say she uses 1 ounce of lemon peel. That means she also uses 1 ounce of smelly stuff. Since she uses twice as much salt as lemon peel, she uses 2 ounces of salt. And since she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses 4 ounces of oil!

Smendrick has three times PJ's cards, so let's think of it like this: PJ has some cards, then Smendrick has three of those groups. That's four groups of cards in total.

If we divide the 329 cards into four groups, we get 82 cards per group (329 divided by 4 is 82 with a little leftover).

"James buys shoes a lot! He buys 2 pairs every month, and that's 2 times 12 months, which is 24 pairs in a whole year.

If he spends $2640 on all those shoes, we gotta see how much each pair costs.  We do that by splitting the total money by the number of pairs: $2640 split by 24 pairs is $110 for each pair.

"Let's see... three green baskets cost 3 times $25, which is $75.  

Red baskets are $18 each, and we get $2 off each one, so they cost $16 each. Three red baskets cost 3 times $16, which is $48.

All together, that's $75 + $48 = $123.

"Okay, so they have 90 rooms, but we only need to clean half. That's like 90 divided by 2, which is 45 rooms.

Each room takes 20 minutes to clean, so 45 rooms times 20 minutes is 900 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is the same as 15 hours.

"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build 12 times 3, which is 36 houses the next year.  That's 12 plus 36, which is 48 houses. Then they double that, so 48 times 2 is 96.  

So in total, they build 48 plus 96, which is 144 houses!

"Claire gets 1 badge every month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets 1 badge every 2 months. That means in a whole year, Amber gets 12 months / 2 months per badge = 6 badges.

Wendy gets 3 times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges every month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges!

Wendy gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.

* Then he ate 10 more pieces the next day.
* On the third day, he ate some more, but I have to do a little math for that one.  

Hmm, 60 pieces minus 24 pieces minus 10 pieces leaves 26 pieces.  Then he ate 14 of those.

"Let's see... Kelly's bacon costs $10. Her chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so that's $2 times $10, which is $20.  She has 6 packs of chicken, so that's $20 times 6, which is $120.  Wait, that seems too much! Oh, that's right, each pack of chicken costs $2, not $20. So 6 packs cost $2 times 6, which is $12.

Her strawberries cost $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 times 3, which is $12. Her apples cost half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 divided by 2, which is $2 each. She has 7 packs of apples, so that's $2 times 7, which is $14.

Now let's add up all the prices: $10 for bacon + $12 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $58.

Kelly has $65 and her groceries cost $58, so she has $65 - $58 = $7 left.

To find the average, we add up the distances and divide by 2 because there are two people. 400 plus 420 is 820. Then 820 divided by 2 is 410.

"Okay, so Fern wants to make lots of widgets and sell them.  

The Widgeteer makes 60 widgets every hour, and it runs all day and all month! That's a lot of widgets! The WidgetMaster makes less, only 45 an hour.

If she sells each widget for $6, the Widgeteer will make her way more money because it makes more widgets.  

Let's see... 60 widgets an hour times 24 hours is 1440 widgets a day! And that's 43200 widgets in a whole month!

The WidgetMaster only makes 32400 widgets in a month.

So, Fern will make $259200 with the Widgeteer and $194400 with the WidgetMaster.

That means she'll make $64800 more with the Widgeteer!

"Cameron stays for 17 hours.  The hotel costs 1000 pesos for 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  So, he needs to pay for 5 extra hours. That's 5 times 70 pesos, which is 350 pesos.

In total, he pays 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Cameron saves 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos!

"Let's see... each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  There are 15 goats, so that's 5 times 15, which is 75 pounds.

Sheep eat less hay. They eat 2 times what a goat eats, then take away 3 pounds. So that's 2 times 5 minus 3, which is 7 pounds per sheep.

There are 12 sheep, so they eat 7 times 12, which is 84 pounds.

All together, Nate needs 75 pounds plus 84 pounds, which is 159 pounds of hay.

"John makes lots of money! He gets 50 dollars for every hour he works, and he worked 6 hours. So that's 50 times 6, which is 300 dollars!

But he spends some money on gas, 50 dollars, and he wants to save 100 dollars.  That means he has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

He buys 5 pencils, and each pencil costs 10 dollars. So the pencils cost 5 times 10, which is 50 dollars.

Now he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100 divided by 25, which is 4 pens.

She gives each of her 29 students 2 juice boxes, so that's 29 times 2, which is 58 juice boxes.  If she starts with 900 and gives away 58, she has 900 minus 58 left.  That's 842 juice boxes for her!

"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come to your house. Then she charges $35 for every hour she works.  She worked for 2 and a quarter hours, so that's like 2 hours and 15 minutes.  That's a little more than 2 hours, so it's $35 times 3, which is $105.  Plus, she used $60 in parts.

So, $40 + $105 + $60 = $205

"Let's see... Jen has 6 yams and each yam costs $1.50. So that's 6 times $1.50 which is $9.00.

Her sweet potatoes are $2.00 each and she has 10, so that's 10 times $2.00 which is $20.00.

And her carrots are $1.25 each and she has 4, so that's 4 times $1.25 which is $5.00.

If we add all that up, $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

"Okay, so James swims 2 miles every hour.  He swims for a while, then takes a break on an island.

He swims 12 miles before his break, 'cause that's 60% of the whole lake. That takes him 6 hours 'cause 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

He rests for 3 hours, 'cause that's half the time he swam.

Then he has 8 miles left to swim, 'cause 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. But now he's tired, so he only swims 1 mile every hour.

So, that last part takes him 8 hours, 'cause 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

In total, it takes him 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to cross the lake.

He sold 10 Wall Street Journals. Each one costs $15. He gets 8 cents for every dollar, so that's $1.20 for each paper. That's $1.20 x 10 = $12.00

If we take 9.6 away from 48, we get 38.4.  Since we can't have part of a person, there must have been about 38 people at the concert.

The Greece plane goes to Greece most of the time, like 3 out of every 4 times. So it goes to Greece 88 divided by 4 times 3 which is 66 times.

"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the room, and then $1.50 for each kid.  That means each class costs $25 + ($1.50 x 10 kids) = $40.

They have class 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 each week.

In a month, they have 4 weeks, so they make $120 x 4 = $480.

"There are 50 porcupines, and 30 of them are girls. Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month. So that's 30 times 4, which is 120 babies every month!  In a year, there are 12 months, so that's 120 times 12, which is 1440 babies!

If we add all the babies to the porcupines we started with, there will be 1440 plus 50, which is 1490 porcupines in the park!

"Okay, so the pool is like a big box, right?  We gotta figure out how much water fits in the box.

It's 14 feet wide and 25 feet long, so that's 14 times 25, which is 350. Then it's 4 feet deep, so we do 350 times 4, which is 1400. That's how many ""boxes"" of water fit in the pool!

They said each box needs 5.9 gallons, so we do 1400 times 5.9, which is 8260 gallons.

Now, they charge 10 cents for each gallon, so we do 8260 times 0.10, which is $826.00.

"Let's count the sticks!

They have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so they have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

In total, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

Shandy drove for 10 hours at 45 miles each hour. That's 10 times 45, which is 450 miles.

Shandy drove 450 miles and Matteo drove 220 miles.  To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

"Okay, so there are 3000 kids at the school. Half of them are older than me, so that's 1500 kids.  Some of those older kids are boys, and some are girls.  Then there are 1500 kids younger than me, and some of them are boys and some are girls too.  Let's see...  

If half the older kids are boys, that means 750 are boys and 750 are girls.  And if half the younger kids are boys, that means 750 are boys and 750 are girls.

So, all together there are 750 + 750 = 1500 girls at the school!

"Wanda filled a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 divided by 4, that's 4500 gallons. Ms. B filled three-quarters of what Wanda filled, so she pumped 4500 times 3 divided by 4, which is 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda filled two-thirds of what she filled on the first day, so that's 4500 times 2 divided by 3, which is 3000 gallons. Ms. B filled one-third of what she filled on the first day, so that's 3375 divided by 3, which is 1125 gallons.

In total, they filled 4500 plus 3375 gallons on the first day, which is 7875 gallons. On the second day, they filled 3000 plus 1125 gallons, which is 4125 gallons.

 Altogether, they filled 7875 plus 4125 gallons, which is 12000 gallons.

The tank holds 18000 gallons, and they filled 12000 gallons, so there are 18000 minus 12000 gallons left to fill. That's 6000 gallons.

"Okay, so Maria's power bank lost some power. First, it lost 9% every hour for 5 hours. That's like losing 9, 9, 9, 9, and 9 more percent, so that's 45% gone!

Then it lost 7% every hour for 3 hours, so that's 7, 7, and 7, which is 21% more gone.

So in total, it lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its power.

That means it had 100% - 66% = 34% left.

But then her friends used some of that power, and it ended up with only 28%.

So her friends used 34% - 28% = 6% of the power.

That 6% came from the 34% that was left after the power bank lost some power on its own.

So, if 6% is like a small piece of the 34%, then the whole 100% must have been much bigger!

It's like if you have a cookie and eat a small piece, you know the whole cookie was bigger before you ate some.

So, the power bank must have started with more than 34% to have 6% left after her friends used some.

It's a bit tricky to figure out exactly how much more, but it was definitely more than 34%!

"Let's see... Jamaar has $10.00.

Peaches cost 50 cents each, and he got 3, so that's 3 times 50 cents, which is $1.50.

Pears are also 50 cents each, and he got 4, so that's 4 times 50 cents, which is $2.00.

Kiwis are $1.00 each, and he got 2, so that's 2 times $1.00, which is $2.00.

Apples are 75 cents each, and he got 5, so that's 5 times 75 cents, which is $3.75.

If we add all that up, it's $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

That means he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Plums cost 25 cents each, so he can buy $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums!

"Teresa sells big fluffy animals for three times the price of the little ones. Today, she sold twice as many little ones as big ones and made $120. Each little fluffy animal costs $4. How many little fluffy animals did she sell?

Hmm, let's see...

If she sold twice as many little ones, and each little one costs $4, we can figure out how much she made from the little ones.  

Let's say she sold 6 big ones. That means she sold 12 little ones (6 times 2).

If she sold 12 little ones at $4 each, that's 12 times 4, which is $48.

That doesn't seem right, because she made $120 in total.  Let's try more big ones!

If she sold 12 big ones, she sold 24 little ones (12 times 2).

If she sold 24 little ones at $4 each, that's 24 times 4, which is $96.

Still not enough! Let's try even more big ones.

If she sold 18 big ones, she sold 36 little ones (18 times 2).

If she sold 36 little ones at $4 each, that's 36 times 4, which is $144.

That's too much!  

Let's go back to when she sold 12 big ones and 24 little ones.  Maybe the big ones cost more than we thought.

If the big ones cost $12 each (3 times $4), and she sold 12, that's 12 times $12, which is $144.

That's too much again!

Let's try selling 6 big ones and 12 little ones again.

If the big ones cost $12 each, and she sold 6, that's 6 times $12, which is $72.

If she made $72 from the big ones and $120 total, she made $48 from the little ones (120 - 72 = 48).

That means she sold 12 little ones!

"Okay, so one dwarf digs up 12 pounds of ore each day.  If he uses a special iron pickaxe, he can dig up twice as much, so that's 12 times 2 which is 24 pounds!

A steel pickaxe is even better! It lets him dig up 50% more than the iron pickaxe.  That means he digs up half of 24 pounds more, which is 24 divided by 2, which is 12 pounds extra.

So with the steel pickaxe, he digs up 24 plus 12, which is 36 pounds a day!

If one dwarf digs up 36 pounds a day, then 40 dwarves dig up 36 times 40, which is 1440 pounds a day!

Now, there are 30 days in a month, so 40 dwarves dig up 1440 times 30, which is 43200 pounds in a whole month!

"
"Okay, so John got 100 three times, that's like 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.

Then he got an 80, so we add that: 300 + 80 = 380.

Now we have to split that number by how many tests he took, which is 4: 380 / 4 = 95.

So his average is 95!

"The glee club ate a lot of pizza! They ate 14 pizzas. The football team ate even more, 32 pizzas!  That means there are 14 pizzas left over.

"
"Anthony wants to send lots of coupons! He's sending 700 small ones and twice as many big ones, so that's 700 times 2 which is 1400 big coupons.

The small ones cost 5 cents each to mail, so that's 700 times 5 cents, which is 35 dollars. The big ones cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 times 15 cents, which is 210 dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons: 35 dollars + 210 dollars = 245 dollars.


$245.00 

"
"Sidney had 7 sandwiches at first.  Then Mark ate some, and Sidney had 3 left.  That's 3 sandwiches times 4 meatballs each, so that's 12 meatballs. Then Sidney got 3 more sandwiches, so that's 6 sandwiches times 4 meatballs each, which is 24 meatballs.  Sidney has 12 meatballs plus 24 meatballs, which is 36 meatballs!

"
"Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck had 20 tons of fertilizer. That's a lot of fertilizer! But 5 trucks broke down, so they couldn't deliver it.  That means 15 trucks made it to the farmers.

Each of those trucks had 20 tons, so 15 trucks * 20 tons each = 300 tons of fertilizer reached the farmers.

"
"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter 'cause he uses 1 pound for every dozen croissants and he's making 6 dozen.

The butter is on sale, so for every pound he buys, he gets another one half off! That means he pays full price for 3 pounds and gets 3 pounds half off.

Full price butter costs $4.00 a pound, so 3 pounds cost 3 x $4.00 = $12.00

The butter that's half off costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00 a pound. So 3 pounds cost 3 x $2.00 = $6.00

All together, the butter will cost $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00



$18.00
"
"Let's see... Kayla invited a lot of people!  

First, we add up all her friends: 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family = 45 people.

Uh oh, some can't come. 45 - 4 = 41 people are coming to the party.

That's more than 20 people, so we need to figure out how many extra people there are: 41 - 20 = 21 extra people.

Each extra person costs $6, so that's 21 x $6 = $126.

Don't forget the starting price of $125!  So the total cost is $125 + $126 = $251.


251 

"
"Maggie spent $15 because a quarter of 60 is 15. Riza spent $20 because a third of 60 is 20.  That means Maggie has $45 left and Riza has $40 left. If you add those together, they have $85 left.

"
"Let's see... there are 3 monkeys. One eats 10 bananas a day, and the other eats 14 bananas a day. That's 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

If they get 45 bananas each day, then the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas.

"
"Teddy did half of the first puzzle, so that's 500 divided by 2, which is 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's 500 more pieces.  

250 plus 500 is 750.


750 

"
"Jenny buys 15 roses, so that's one bunch of 12 roses for $15 and 3 more roses for $2 each, so that's $6.  That's $15 + $6 = $21.

She has five $5 bills, so she has $25.

She gets $25 - $21 = $4 in change.

There are 4 quarters in every dollar, so she gets $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

"
"Let's see...

* He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so that's 6 times 5.50... which is $33.00
* He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so that's 9 times 11... which is $99.00
* He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so that's 20 times 1.50... which is $30.00

Now, let's add it all up: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

"Okay, so the first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. Then the next train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves. That train only stays for 5 minutes.  The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves, and it leaves right away. The train Paul needs comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves.

Let's see... 10 minutes + 20 minutes + 30 minutes + 5 minutes + 60 minutes + 20 minutes... that's 145 minutes!

"
"Mr. Rogers got the watch for $1500. That's less than the real price of $2000.  He sold it to his friend for $1800.  That means his friend saved $200!

To find the discount, we see how much less $1800 is than $2000.  That's $200. Then we divide that by the original price: $200 / $2000 = 0.1.

To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 0.1 times 100 is 10%.

**Answer:** 10 

"
"If one spring makes one jellyfish every second, then in an hour it makes lots and lots!  That's 60 minutes times 60 seconds, so 3600 jellyfish!

If we have 5 springs, they'd make 5 times as many, so 18,000 jellyfish in one hour.

In 4 hours, that's 18,000 times 4, which is 72,000 jellyfish!


72000 

"
"Okay, so Binkie scored 90. Frankie scored way more than that!  Twice Binkie's score is 90 times 2, which is 180.  But Frankie scored 15 more than that, so we add 15 to 180.  That means Frankie scored 195!


195 

"
"James walked 2 miles to the middle, then 2 miles back home. That's 4 miles already! Then he walked 2 more miles to the store.  So he walked 6 miles in total.

If he walks 4 miles every hour, it took him 1 and a half hours to get to the store.


1.5 

"
"Jenny bought a lot of bananas!  She got 10 bunches, and each bunch had 4 bananas, so that's 10 times 4, which is 40 bananas.

If she bought them one by one, it would cost 40 times 80 cents, which is $32.00.

But she got a deal on the bunches! 10 bunches cost $30.00.

So she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!


$2.00 

"
"Harry gets more fence than Sam, so let's see... if they have 100 feet and Harry gets 60 more than Sam, that means Sam has less than 50 feet.  

Let's try 20 feet for Sam. That means Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

20 + 80 = 100, so that's right!

"Okay, so Marcel sold lots of bikes!

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes, and each one costs $450, so that's 150 times $450... hmm... that's $67,500!

* He sold 45 BMX bikes, and those are half the price of the MTB bikes, which cost $500. So BMX bikes cost $250 each.  That means he made 45 times $250, which is $11,250.

* That leaves 105 MTB bikes.  Those are $500 each, so he made 105 times $500, which is $52,500.

Now, let's add up all the money: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Marcel made $131,250 selling bikes!

"The farmer makes 5 bales every hour, so in 6 hours he makes 5 x 6 = 30 bales.

The truck takes away 3 bales every hour, so in 6 hours it takes 3 x 6 = 18 bales.

"
"John has 8 classes a day 'cause he has 2 extra. That's 8 times 40 minutes, which is 320 minutes of class each day.  

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 times 5, which is 1600 minutes.

On the weekend, he studies for 100 minutes each day, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 minutes.

In total, he studies 1600 plus 200, which is 1800 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he studies for 1800 divided by 60, which is 30 hours a week.

"Okay, so the ball starts way up high, 3 floors up! That's like 3 times 24 feet, so 72 feet!

Then it bounces, and each bounce it goes a little lower. It goes 2 out of 3 of the height it was before. So after the first bounce, it goes 2/3 of 72 feet, which is 48 feet.

Then it bounces again! This time it goes 2/3 of 48 feet, which is 32 feet.


**Answer:** 32 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

The first kid is 6 feet tall, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so that's 6 times 12, which is 72 inches.

The second kid is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third kid is 5 inches shorter than the second kid, so they are 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third kid, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

"They sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples, so they sold 200 bags.  If each bag costs $5, then they made 200 times $5 dollars.  That's $1000!

"The Allosaurus ate what was left, which was 270 kilograms. That means before they came, there was double that, so 270 times 2 is 540 kilograms.

But the velociraptors ate half, so before they came there was double again!  That's 540 times 2, which is 1080 kilograms.


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to paint four walls. Two walls are big, like my bedroom wall, 10 feet by 8 feet. That's a lot of space! The other two walls are smaller, like the wall in my bathroom, 5 feet by 8 feet.

One can of paint can cover a small space, like my bathroom wall.  It says it covers 20 square feet.  

Let's see... 10 times 8 is 80, so the big walls are 80 square feet each. And 80 times 2 is 160.

The small walls are 5 times 8, which is 40. And 40 times 2 is 80.

So all together, it's 160 plus 80, which is 240.

Now, we need to see how many cans of paint Tony needs. 240 divided by 20 is 12 cans.

Each can costs $12, so 12 times $12 is... $144!

That's a lot of money for paint!

"
"Ellen had 3 sodas that were shaken up. Her brother took one, so there are 2 left.  There are 8 sodas in total now.  So, there's a 2 out of 8 chance her friend will get a shaken soda. That's like 1 out of 4, which is 25%!

"
"The fast train goes 60 miles every hour, so in 3 hours it goes 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

The slow train goes 30 miles every hour, so in 3 hours it goes 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

If we add those together, they are 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart!


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That means he helps 2 x 3 = 6 people every day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days.

But Billy takes a break for 20% of those days.  That's 50 x 0.20 = 10 days off.

So he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

That means he helps 6 x 40 = 240 people!


240 

"
"Wow, that's a lot of people!  Let's see... 12 buses with 35 people in each bus is 12 times 35... hmm... that's 420 people! And 20 cars with 3 people in each car is 20 times 3, which is 60 people.  So, there were 420 plus 60 people at the wedding, which is 480 people!

"The big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute. So it takes 5 minutes to go down (300 / 60 = 5).

The smaller slide is 240 feet and you go 80 feet every minute. That takes 3 minutes (240 / 80 = 3).

The big slide takes 2 minutes longer than the small slide (5 - 3 = 2).

"
"Bobby eats lunch for 30 minutes and takes two 15 minute breaks, so that's 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes of breaks each day.

Over 5 days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes of breaks.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

"
"Micah ran 3.5 times more than Amber, so he ran 8 x 3.5 = 28 miles.

Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she got $15.00 back, so now it's $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

The frying pan was on sale, so it cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were also on sale, so they cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

That means the new stuff cost $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

So now her card has $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00 on it.

Hmm, that's a lot of numbers! Let's see... she needs $40,000 each year for 20 years, so that's $40,000 times 20, which is $800,000!

She saves $20,000 every year.  If she needs $800,000, it will take her $800,000 divided by $20,000, which is 40 years!

"First, we cut the ribbon into 4 equal pieces. That means each piece is 100 centimeters divided by 4, which is 25 centimeters long.

The tall shoes are 4 inches, and there are three of them, so that's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 inches.

The shorter shoes are 2 inches, and there are three of them, so that's 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 inches.

All together, that's 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Now we have 18 inches of heels for 6 ladies.  So, 18 divided by 6 is 3.

"Soledad wants to walk a lot in June! She wants to walk 9300 miles, but she's only walking 250 miles each day.  

If she walks 250 miles a day for all of June, she'll walk 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

That means she needs to walk 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 more miles.

To get those extra miles in June, she needs to walk 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 more miles each day.

"Okay, so the farmer starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Then he gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks. That's like 20 cows a day times 7 days, which is 140 cows every week.  And three weeks is 140 times 3, so that's 420 more cows!

He also gets 10 chickens every day for three weeks. So that's 10 chickens a day times 7 days, which is 70 chickens every week. And three weeks is 70 times 3, so that's 210 more chickens!

So now he has 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows.

And he has 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.

That means he has 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals in total!

"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels. That's 4 times 9, which is 36 bagels!

Each pack costs $10.00, and he buys 4 packs, so that's 4 times $10.00, which is $40.00.

But wait, he gets a discount! It's 10% off, so that's $40.00 times 0.10, which is $4.00 off.

So, he pays $40.00 minus $4.00, which is $36.00 for all the bagels.

Now, to find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total price by the number of bagels: $36.00 divided by 36 bagels equals $1.00 per bagel.

"Chester eats a lot of eggs!  

First, he eats 3 eggs a day for a whole month, that's 30 days. So that's 3 times 30 which is 90 eggs.

Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30 which is 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 plus 150 which is 240 eggs.

Now, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we need to see how many dozens are in 240.  240 divided by 12 is 20.

"Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets every day. That's a lot of sunflowers!

Let's see... he makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, so that's $26 + $56 = $82 every day.

If each sunflower costs $2 and he makes $82, he must sell $82 / $2 = 41 sunflowers every day.

Over 3 days, he sells 41 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 123 sunflowers.

"Abraham had a big piece of land, 80 squares! He sold half of it first for $50. Then he sold a quarter of what was left for $30.  He sold the rest for $3 for each square.

Let's see... half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 squares for $50. That leaves him with 40 squares. A quarter of 40 is 10, so he sold 10 more squares for $30. Now he has 30 squares left.

He sold those last 30 squares for $3 each, so that's 30 times 3, which is $90.

If we add up all the money, $50 + $30 + $90, he made $170!

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 minus 2, which is 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 divided by 2, which is 4 eggs.

"Okay, so John has lots of apartments to pick up trash from!  

The first two have 200 each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last one is bigger, like way bigger! It has 60 more for every 100 apartments in the other two, so it has 400 times 0.60, which is 240 more apartments.

That means the last one has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Wow, that's a lot of trash!  All together, he picks up from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each one 3 times a week, so that's 1440 times 3 = 4320 times he picks up trash.

He gets 40 cents for each time, so he makes 4320 times $0.40 = $1728.00 every week!

Hmm, let's see... If we take away 7 from the yellow rope, it's the same size as the blue rope. Then, the red rope is four times the size of the blue rope.  

That means if we know how long the yellow rope is, we can figure out the rest!

Let's say the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long. Then the blue rope is 5 centimeters long (12 - 7 = 5). And the red rope is 20 centimeters long (5 x 4 = 20).

If we add those up, it's 12 + 5 + 20 = 37 centimeters! That's right!

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.

That means the bedrooms and living room are 960 plus 1200, which is 2160 square feet.

"Brian used the low setting for 3 days, and it takes out 1 liter each day, so that's 1 x 3 = 3 liters.

The medium setting takes out twice as much as the low setting, so it takes out 1 x 2 = 2 liters each day.  He used it for 3 days, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 liters.

The high setting takes out twice as much as the medium setting, so it takes out 2 x 2 = 4 liters each day. He used it for 5 days, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total, we add up all the liters: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"Jolene had lots of balloons! She had 10 packs, and each pack had 30 balloons. That's 10 times 30, which is 300 balloons!  But they didn't use all of them. They had 12 left over. So they threw 300 minus 12 balloons.  

300 - 12 = 288

They threw 288 balloons!

"Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and 14 times 3, which is 42 mL, of the second medicine. That's 14 + 42 = 56 mL in total for one dose.

"Ali's class is big, it can fit 120 kids! John has two classes, but they are smaller. Each of John's classes can only fit 15 kids because they are 1/8 the size of Ali's class.  So John's classes can fit 30 kids in total.  If we add all the kids together, Ali's class plus John's classes, that's 120 + 30 = 150 kids!

"Stephen borrowed money from his sister and has to pay her back a little extra. He pays her some money each month, and then pays the rest all at once.  

Let's see... he borrowed $300, and has to pay 2% more. That's like 2 cents for every dollar, so he owes 2 x 300 = $6 extra.

So, he owes $300 + $6 = $306 in total.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $25 x 11 = $275.

That means he still has to pay $306 - $275 = $31 in the last month.

"Okay, so the jar is like a box, right? It's 6 inches wide and 6 inches long, and 15 inches tall.  That's a lot of jelly beans!

Each jelly bean is kinda small, like a tiny cube.  He said they're 0.15 cubic inches.  That means they don't fit perfectly together, so there's some space left over.

He thinks about 30% of the jelly beans are red.  That's like if you had 10 jelly beans, 3 of them would be red.

He guessed there were 864 red jelly beans, but there were actually 900.  

So, he was off by 36 jelly beans!

"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Then, at the next stop, 30 more people get on because 30 is three-quarters of 40.  So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the last stop, everyone doubles, so there are 90 x 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year, and each time it costs $2. So for 5 years, she spends 3 * $2 * 5 = $30.

Then the price goes up by a lot, 150%! That means it's now $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she spends 3 * $5 * 3 = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75.

"Okay, so there are 10 kids in each grade who get to try the escape room, but only 8 can go at a time.  That means each grade needs two groups. There are four grades, so that's 2 groups times 4 grades, which is 8 groups in total.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 8 groups times 45 minutes, which is 360 minutes.

"John made 4 tables and each table cost $20. So that's 4 times 20, which is 80 dollars. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each. So that's 2 times 10, which is 20 dollars.  

To find out how much Ali has to pay, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: 80 plus 20 is 100 dollars.

"Let's see... the board is 40 feet long.  The longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter piece.  Hmmm... if we think of it like groups, we need to split the board into 5 groups because 4 groups plus 1 group makes 5.

So, each group is 40 feet divided by 5 groups, which is 8 feet long.

The longer piece is 4 groups, so it's 8 feet times 4, which is 32 feet long!

"Okay, so the call costs 25 cents for each minute at first.  If you talk for 16 minutes, that's 16 times 25 cents, which is $4.00.

Then the price goes down to 20 cents a minute.  You talk for 20 more minutes after the first 16, so that's 20 times 20 cents, which is $4.00.

So, the whole call costs $4.00 plus $4.00, which is $8.00.

"It rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday will rain 1 more inch than 2 times that amount. So, 2 times Monday's rain is 2 x 2 = 4 inches. Then we add 1 more inch, so Tuesday will have 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain.

"Okay, so Karen wants a manicure and a pedicure. That's $35 plus $40, which is $75.  But the salon has a deal! If you get both, it's 20% off.  That means $75 times 0.20 is $15 off. So now it's $75 minus $15, which is $60.

She also wants pretty designs on her nails, and each nail costs $3. She has 10 nails, so that's $3 times 10, which is $30.

Finally, we add the price of the manicure and pedicure with the discount to the price of the nail art: $60 plus $30 is $90.

"Let's see... she gets 3 magazines that each have 12 magazines in them, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 magazines. Then she has one with 6 magazines. And the last one has 4 times the 6 magazine one, so that's 6 times 4, which is 24 magazines.  

If we add them all up, 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 magazines!

"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each lesson. He has four of those, so that's 4 times $80, which is $320.

For the veterans, he takes off $20 from his price, so he charges $60. He has two of those lessons, so that's 2 times $60, which is $120.

Now we add the money from both kinds of lessons: $320 + $120 = $440

"Okay, to find Sally's average score, we add up all her scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

"Walter ate 24 apples because 60 divided by 5 is 12, and 12 times 2 is 24.

Then he had 36 apples left because 60 minus 24 is 36.

He gave his sister 9 apples because 36 times 25 and then divided by 100 is 9.

That means he had 27 apples left because 36 minus 9 is 27.

He got $81 because 27 times 3 is 81.

"Regina wrote 9 books last year, and that's only three-quarters of the books she wrote this year.  

To find out how many she wrote this year, we can think of it like sharing a pizza! If 9 books are three-quarters of the whole pizza, we need to figure out what one-quarter is.

If we divide 9 by 3, we get 3. That means one-quarter of the books she wrote this year is 3.

To find the whole pizza (all the books this year), we multiply that number by 4: 3 x 4 = 12

"Michael drives for 3 whole days, that's a lot of driving!  If he goes 50 kilometers every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, he drives 50 times 24, which is 1200 kilometers each day.

So in 3 days, he drives 1200 times 3, which is 3600 kilometers.

Alaska and Texas are really far apart, 6000 kilometers!  

To see what part of the trip he finished, we can do a little math. 3600 kilometers is like 3600 out of 6000, which is the same as 60 out of 100.

That means he finished 60% of the trip!

"Okay, so they gotta clean 80 rooms, and that takes 15 minutes each.  That's 80 times 15, which is 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work for 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 8 times 60, which is 480 minutes each day.

They work for 5 days, so that's 480 times 5, which is 2400 minutes of work.

Now, to see what part of the day is cleaning, we do 1200 divided by 2400, which is half.  Half of the day is 50%.

"Let's see... each middle shelf holds 10 books, and there are two of those, so that's 10 + 10 = 20 books.

The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, so it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books.

The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

That means each bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, and 110 / 55 = 2.  She needs 2 bookcases!

"Rose bought lots of eggs! Five groups of twelve eggs, that's sixty eggs in total. She paid $2.40 for each group, so that's $2.40 x 5 = $12.00.

She wants to sell them in groups of three for $1.00 each.  She can make twenty groups of three eggs from sixty eggs. So she'll earn $1.00 x 20 = $20.00.

If she earns $20.00 and spent $12.00, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% right.  That's like getting 6 out of every 10 right.

Hmm, let's see... 70 times 6 is 420.  Wait, that's not right.  Oh yeah, we need to find out how many she got right out of 70.  So 70 times 0.60 is 42.

That means she needs to get 77 questions right in total.

She already got 42 right, so she needs 77 minus 42, which is 35 more right answers on the second test.

So, he needs 15 people to come to the car place to buy 15 cars.  That means he needs 30 people to come look (because 15 x 2 = 30).

To get 30 people to come, he needs to make a lot of calls!  He needs to make 750 calls (because 30 x 25 = 750).

"Let's count them up!

They have 4 flashlights, one for each person.

Half the rooms have 4 candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 candles.

That's 16 plus 20, which is 36 candles!

So they have 36 candles plus 4 flashlights, for a total of 40.

* The ones that need a whole cup, that's 8 plants times 1 cup, so that's 8 cups.
* The rest need a quarter cup, and there are 8 of those. So that's 8 plants times a quarter cup, which is 2 cups.

Now let's add it all up: 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups!

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day.

"Phineas hops fast on land, 20 yards every minute!  That means it takes him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to hop half way.

He swims slower, 10 yards every minute. So swimming half way takes 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.

To get home, it takes him 5 minutes hopping plus 10 minutes swimming, for a total of 15 minutes.

"Okay, so the boat started at $9000.  The first year it lost 30%, which is like 30 out of every 100.  So we do 9000 times 0.30 and that's 2700.  Then we take that away from the starting price: 9000 - 2700 = 6300.

The next year it lost another 30%, so we do the same thing: 6300 times 0.30 = 1890.  Take that away: 6300 - 1890 = 4410.

Last year it lost 20%, so 4410 times 0.20 = 882.  Take that away one last time: 4410 - 882 = 3528.

Then we take away the broken ones: 732 - 67 = 665

They found 665 good seashells!

"Let's see... she needs a plate, a bowl, and a salad plate for each person. That's 3 things for each person.

So, for 12 people, that's 12 times 3, which is 36 things.

Each of those things costs money, so we gotta add up the prices: $6 + $5 + $4 = $15.

Then we multiply that by how many things she needs: $15 times 36 = $540.

"Steve took a long time to do the puzzle!  He worked for 10 hours. Anna took half of that time plus 2 more hours. So, half of 10 is 5, and then we add 2 more... that's 7 hours!

"Let's see... Dexter has 5 piggies, and each one eats 4 pounds of food two times a day. So that's 4 times 2 which is 8 pounds a day for each piggy.  

Then all the piggies together eat 8 times 5 which is 40 pounds a day.

In a whole week, that's 40 times 7 which is 280 pounds.

Dexter had 300 pounds, and the piggies ate 280 pounds, so he has 300 minus 280 which is 20 pounds left.

"John needs enough hot dogs for all his friends! He has 20 friends coming and they each want 2 hot dogs. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs!

But he already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 40 minus 4, which is 36 more hot dogs.

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he needs to buy 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 times 2, which is $12.

"Frances sells lots of yummy treats! She makes $40 from cupcakes and $40 from cookies. That's $40 + $40 = $80!

But she had to buy trays, and those cost $20.  

So, she has $80 - $20 = $60 left.

"Okay, so there were 5 kids at first. Then each kid got a friend, so there were 5 times 2, which is 10 kids! Then on the next street, each kid got TWO more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids! But then the first 5 kids got tired and went home.  So 20 minus 5 is 15 kids left.

"Mamou started with 1360 meals. She gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

"Let's see... a quarter is 25 cents. Two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.

"Let's see... there are two brothers. One is 12, and the other is 24 because 12 times 2 is 24.  The sisters are all 16.  There are three of them, so that's 16 plus 16 plus 16, which is 48.  

If we add up all their ages, it's 12 plus 24 plus 48, which is 84.

"Charisma meditates for 30 minutes every day. That's 30 times 7, which is 210 minutes a week.

She does yoga for 1 hour, which is 60 minutes, five times a week. So that's 60 times 5, which is 300 minutes.

That means she does 210 plus 300 minutes a week, which is 510 minutes.

Over four weeks, she does 510 times 4, which is 2040 minutes.

"Let's see... she has lots of shirts!

* The small shirts are 3 feet each, and she has 11 of those, so that's 3 times 11, which is 33 feet.
* The medium shirts are 4 feet each, and she has 8, so that's 4 times 8, which is 32 feet.
* The big shirts are 6 feet each, and she has 6, so that's 6 times 6, which is 36 feet.

Now we add them all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 feet!

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 times 12, so that's 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more seeds, so that's like half of 36 more seeds. Half of 36 is 18, so the big sunflower has 36 plus 18, which is 54 seeds.  

Together they have 36 plus 54, which is 90 seeds.

"Anne is really tall! She's twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches. So Anne is 36 times 2 which is 72 inches tall. Jackie is a little shorter than Anne, just 2 inches shorter. That means Jackie is 72 minus 2, which is 70 inches tall.

But Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before summer she was 70 minus 3, which is 67 inches tall.

"They make 5000 chocolate bars each day and sell them for $2 each. So that's 5000 times 2, which is $10,000 every day!

In a week, that's $10,000 times 7, which is $70,000.

For two weeks, it's $70,000 times 2, so they make $140,000!


$140000 

"
"Okay, so Jake buys two shirts. Each shirt costs $8, but one is half price!  That means the second shirt costs $8 / 2 = $4.

So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes were $40, but they're 40% off.  That's like $40 / 10 = $4 off for every $10. So 40% off is $4 * 4 = $16 off.

The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

All together, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.

"Ryan got $6 for each week he did chores, and he did them for 3 weeks, so he made $6 x 3 = $18.

Then he bought ice cream for himself and his 3 friends, so that's 4 people in total. Each ice cream cost $1.25, so the ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $5.

That means Ryan has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of the two bathrobes, so that's $30 + $100 + $100 = $230.

To find out how much they spent together, we add Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: $105 + $230 = $335.

"Okay, so Tim uses stuff that costs money to make his yummy jam.

* Passion fruit costs $6 for each pound, and he uses 2 pounds, so that's $6 x 2 = $12.
* Jackfruit costs $8 per pound, and he uses 1.5 pounds, so that's $8 x 1.5 = $12.
* Honey costs $10 per pound, and he uses 2 pounds, so that's $10 x 2 = $20.

To make one jar, it costs $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 = $6 profit for each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6 x 10 = $60 profit!

* Nickels: 120 nickels are worth 120 times 5 cents, which is $6.00
* Pennies: 750 pennies are worth 750 times 1 cent, which is $7.50

"Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 for her ticket and $7.50 for her sister's ticket, that's $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00.  Then she spent $8.50 on a bracelet.  So she spent a total of $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

Her parents gave her $40.00 and she spent $27.00, so she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.

"Randy had lots of cookies! He had 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies.  That's 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies!

He ate one of each kind for a snack, so he had 18 - 3 = 15 cookies left.

Then he ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he had 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.

He gave 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he had 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.

Then he baked more cookies! He baked 4 of each kind, so that's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 more cookies.

Now he has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies!

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half for $5 each, so that's 6 toys times $5, which is $30.  The other half he sells for $7 each, so that's 6 toys times $7, which is $42.  If we add those together, he makes $30 + $42 = $72.

"The doggy dug a lot of holes!  He dug 6 holes every day for 14 days, so that's 6 times 14 which is 84 holes.

Nate fills 9 holes each day, but the doggy digs 6 more each night. So Nate really fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes each day.

It takes him 84 holes / 3 holes a day = 28 days to fill all the holes.

That's 28 days / 7 days a week = 4 weeks!

Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300, and Maryam raised $400 more, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

"Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that, so he ran 2 miles.

Aaron ran his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs 1 mile in 8 minutes.

Vanessa runs half as fast as Aaron, so she takes twice as long to run a mile. That means she takes 8 minutes times 2, which is 16 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 16 minutes per mile times 4 miles, which is 64 minutes.

"Okay, so Tom's restaurant has 6 groups of people coming each night. Each group gets 2 plates of food that cost $5 each, and they also get a bottle of wine for $5.  

So, each group spends $5 + $5 + $5 = $15.

That means each night they make 6 groups * $15/group = $90.

If they're open 2 nights a week, they make $90/night * 2 nights = $180 a week.

Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes, so she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.
