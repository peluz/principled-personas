"Okay, let's break this down.  

So, Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That means he's already put in $130,000.

The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the house is now worth 2.5 times its original value ($80,000 x 2.5 = $200,000).

To find his profit, we subtract his total investment from the final value: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hmm, let's see. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them a total of 60 cups.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Let's break down the cost:

* Since every other glass is discounted, Kylar is essentially buying glasses in pairs.
* Each pair costs $5 + ($5 * 0.60) = $8.
* He's buying 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs.
* The total cost is 8 pairs * $8/pair = $64.

"Let's see... Charleston has 4 times the sheep Seattle has, so that's 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston, meaning they have 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.  Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 plus Charleston's 80 plus Toulouse's 160 gives us a total of 260 sheep.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So Carla's downloading a big file, 200 GB. Normally, she's zipping along at 2 GB per minute. But then, ugh, Windows decides to update, right in the middle! That's a 20-minute delay.

Let's see... she was 40% done before the update, so that's 80 GB downloaded already.  That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Now she's gotta start over, so she's got 120 GB left to download. That'll take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

So it takes Carla a total of 120 minutes to download the file.

"That's easy!  

Here's how to figure that out:

* Month 2 had three times the downloads of month 1: 60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads
* Month 3 had 30% fewer downloads than month 2: 180 downloads * 0.30 = 54 downloads less
* So month 3 had: 180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads

"Let's break this down. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more!  

Think of it like this:

* She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That means the 5 she has left are what's remaining after selling to the orange house.
* Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, she must have had double that amount before.

So, if she has 5 left, she had 5 x 2 = 10 before the orange house.

Now, remember she sold some at the red house, so she had even more before that.

And before the green house, she had even more!

Let's work backwards:

* **Before orange house:** 10
* **Before red house:** 10 + 2 = 12
* **Before green house:** 12 x 3 = 36



Melanie must have started with 36 vacuum cleaners. 

**Answer:** 36

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Let's figure this out! 

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33 = $17). Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50 = 2).

"Let's break this down!

If Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio, and their total age is 162, we can figure out their individual ages.  

Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  There are 18 parts total (7 + 11). Each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

Adding up all the guesses, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80.

"Let's see... Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  To figure out how many gold coins she has, we can think of it like this:

If we take away those extra 30 gold coins, we'd have the same number of gold and silver coins. That would mean we have 110 coins / 2 = 55 of each type.

Since there are 30 more gold coins, Gretchen has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days.  He runs for 3 hours on the first day and half that time, or 1.5 hours, on the other two days. That means he runs a total of 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours each week.

To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"Okay, let's break this down.  If Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, then she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).  That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit will be $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

"Okay, let's break this down. 

Meredith writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than that, which is 5 * (2/5) = 2 extra articles. So, she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she doubles her Tuesday output, meaning she writes 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles over the three days.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

* Each phone costs $150, and there's a 2% interest charge, so that's $150 * 0.02 = $3 extra per phone.
* For all five phones, the total interest is $3/phone * 5 phones = $15.
* The total she'll pay is $750 (for the phones) + $15 (interest) = $765.

* He sold 9 petunias, so that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* And he sold 17 begonias, so that's 17 * $2 = $34.

"That's a fun problem!  Let's see... if the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down.

The level below the top would be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.

The level below that would be 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.

And the bottom level would be 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Adding all those up, we get 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet total.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Oh, that's easy!  If each rose bush has 25 roses and there are 8 thorns on each rose, then there are 25 * 8 = 200 thorns per bush. With 3 bushes, that's a total of 200 * 3 = 600 thorns.

"That's a classic sports word problem!  

Here's how to figure it out:

Let's say they lost ""x"" games. They won 8 more than that, so they won ""x + 8"" games.

In total, they played 22 games, so x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Since not everyone always comes to parties, Christina needs to plan for a little less than the full number of friends she invited.  

She needs 0.75 of a gift bag for each person who actually comes. If she invited 16 friends and a quarter of them don't show up, that means 12 friends will probably be there.

So, she needs 12 friends * 0.75 gift bags/friend = 9 gift bags.

At $2 per bag, that'll cost her 9 * $2 = $18.

"Let's see... John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one more before bed. That's 4 glasses a day on weekdays.  On the weekend, he skips the water with dinner and has soda instead, so he only drinks 3 glasses a day then.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Each box has its outside measurements, but we need the space *inside* where you'd put things. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we take away 2 inches from each outside measurement (1 inch from each side).

So, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the volume, we multiply those together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

Think of it like this: each ""part"" of the ratio represents a certain amount.  

*  7 + 13 = 20 total parts

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  

Four years ago, Adrien made $40,000, so that means Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.40) = $43,076.92 (approximately).

"Let's break this down. If Seth is twice Brooke's age, that means if Brooke is 'b' years old, Seth is '2b' years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' and Seth will be '2b + 2'.  We know that their ages added together at that point will be 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Adding that to her minimum payments gives us her total monthly payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one of those.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to get an even number on the first roll (50% chance) AND another even number on the second roll (another 50% chance).  So that's a 25% chance overall.

That means rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% more likely.

"Let's figure this out!

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so she went down 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. That means Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Plus, there's a 12% transfer fee, which is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

Adding those to the original price, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

Let's break down Mr. Tan's house sale.  

First, we need to figure out his total expenses. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000, which is $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000, which is $20,000. Adding those together with the $250,000 he paid for the loan, his total expenses are $282,000.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% of that time to get to 400 degrees.  That's 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, that's 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

Scene 2 is 6 lines longer than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. He says four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $30,000 before taxes. With a 20% tax rate, Nick would take home $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but there's a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax on what's left. After the property tax, he'd have $36,000, and 10% of that is $3,600 in taxes. That means his take-home pay would be $32,400.

Job B pays $8,400 more than Job A.

Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so her initial investment is $64. The first year, the stock goes up 50%, meaning each share is now worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.  That makes her shares worth $96 (8 shares * $12/share).

The second year, the stock drops 25%, so each share is now worth $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9. Her total value is now 8 shares * $9/share = $72.

"Let's break this down!  If two groups are the same size, and the third is smaller by 10, we can think about it like this:

* Imagine the two bigger groups combined have 'y' students.
* The smallest group has 'y - 10' students.
* All together, there are 200 students, so y + (y - 10) = 200

Let's solve for 'y':

* 2y - 10 = 200
* 2y = 210
* y = 105

Since each of the bigger groups has 'y' students, they each have 105 students.

The smallest group has 105 - 10 = 95 students.

"Let's see... 60 animals, twice as many chickens as cows...  

Okay, if we think of it like this:

* If there were only cows, there would be 60 / 3 = 20 cows.
* Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find the total time, we can divide 15 hours by 0.30, which equals 50 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles going from the first city to the second and then to the third.

It travels 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles going back to the first city.

That means each round trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

Finally, to find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so those will be 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords cost $12 each, for a total of 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Each blouse is $20, and they're 30% off, so that's a discount of $6 per blouse ($20 x 0.30 = $6).  That means each blouse costs $14 ($20 - $6 = $14).

Since Misha is buying 4 blouses, the total cost is $56 ($14 x 4 = $56).

"Let's see... Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short ones, so that's 15 apples.  Her sister got twice as many from the tall trees, which is 60 apples, and three times as many from the short trees, so that's 45 apples. Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Okay, let's break down Tom's trip:

* He traveled 200 kilometers a day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
* Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of his first four days' distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.
* In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all that up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

So, Bill pays $8 a month for the first 6 months, which is $8 * 6 = $48.

Then it goes up to $12 a month for 8 months, so that's $12 * 8 = $96.

Finally, it increases to $14 a month for another 8 months, making it $14 * 8 = $112.

"Hmm, let's see... Cole got a good deal on those jeans!

* The soup was 25% more than the bagel, so it cost $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5.

"That's a fun problem! Let's see... if Kenny had $50 left over after buying his ticket, that means he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sold each card for $1.50, he must have sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards.  But you can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

If he sold 33 cards, which is 2/3 of his collection, then he started with 33 / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  Since he can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards!

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  We're given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. So, to find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

James is a bit slower on the bike than Jon, but faster in the swim. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have made up some time on the run.  

Here's how we can figure out James's run time:

* **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
* **James's swim time:** 40 minutes * 0.90 (10% faster) = 36 minutes
* **James's bike time:** 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
* **James's total time:** 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time = 121 minutes + James's run time

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon's:

* 121 minutes + James's run time = 170 minutes - 10 minutes
* 121 minutes + James's run time = 160 minutes

Subtract 121 minutes from both sides to find James's run time:

* James's run time = 39 minutes

"That's easy! If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day, and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, he's getting 6 grams of protein per day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6).  Over a week, that adds up to 42 grams (6 * 7 = 42).

"Let's break this down!  

We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other two angles are 2x and 3x.  

That means x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's see... Colby has a lot of coins!  

* He's got 8 quarters, which is 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents, or $2.00.
* His 6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents.
* His 14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents.
* And his 15 pennies are worth 15 cents.

Adding it all up, Colby has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, or 5 cents, he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs!

Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.  He increases that by half of 8, which is 4 pounds. So that's 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.  But that's too heavy, so he goes down 2 pounds. That means he's using 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, that means it's flying at 400 miles per hour (1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour).

Then he sold 10 cups an hour for 2 hours, which is 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

Those cups earned him 20 * $0.60 = $12.00

In total, Patrick made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles = 145,000 rotations/month).

Since each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, they should last him 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months).

That's equal to 6 years (72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the bottle lasts for 120 washes with 2 pumps per wash, then using 1 pump per wash will make the bottle last for twice as many washes, which is 240 washes.

Since Jackie uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Joe's got $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35.  That's a total of $60 before the sale.  

Since everything is 30% off, the shirt will cost $25 - ($25 x 0.30) = $17.50. The shorts will cost $35 - ($35 x 0.30) = $24.50.

Joe will have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left over.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So, John's initial funding was enough for 5 months, and his project ended up taking 10 times longer, meaning 50 months total. That means he needed funding for an additional 45 months.

His funding increased by 50% after the first 5 months, so he was spending 1.5 times his original amount each month for the rest of the project.

That means his monthly expenses for those 45 months were $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

His total cost for those 45 months was $150,000/month * 45 months = $6,750,000.

Adding that to his initial $500,000, his total research cost was $7,250,000.

Gary does laundry twice a week, so that's 2 loads * 52 weeks = 104 loads a year.

Each load uses 20 gallons, meaning he uses 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons of water per year.

Since water costs $0.15 per gallon, his yearly water bill for laundry is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

To figure out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a little conversion. 

First, we know there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb. So, her speed of 20 kb per second is equal to 0.02 Mb per second (20 / 1000 = 0.02).

Next, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, to get her speed per hour, we multiply: 0.02 Mb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

Next, we find the total money made from selling all the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.  Subtract the cost to get the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

"Oh, poor pups! Let's figure out how many toys James needs. 

He starts with enough for 4 dogs, but then 8 more dogs arrive. That means he needs 8 more toys right away.  Then, even more dogs show up - twice as many as before! That's 8 dogs * 2 = 16 more dogs. So he needs 16 more toys for those pups.

That's a lot of toys! In total, he needs 8 + 16 = 24 toys.

But wait! Three dogs get adopted, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.  That means he only needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys.

"Let's break down the investments:

* Dylan put in 2/5 of the $1200, which is (2/5) * $1200 = $480.
* That leaves $1200 - $480 = $720.
* Frances invested 2/3 of what was left, so she put in (2/3) * $720 = $480.
*  Skyler covered the rest, meaning Skyler invested $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.

* Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
* Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, meaning the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.
* Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Adding up all their cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

If the dress is 140cm long now and that includes an extra 20cm of lace, then the dress was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long before the lace.

"
"Let's see... we have one set of twins and one set of triplets.  One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years, and all together they add up to 44 years old.  

To figure out how old one of the twins is, we can think of it like this:

* Let's say the triplets are all 'r' years old.
* One twin is 'r + 7' years old.
* The other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That means 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old.

That means one of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Let's figure this out!

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

"Let's figure out how much money John has left. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 x 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before we add that in, the bill is $40.

60% of $40 is $40 x 0.60 = $24 for the heartworm check.

Adding that to the vaccine cost, the total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

John brought $125, so he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left.

* Oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each, and there are 7, for a total of $21.00.

Adding it all up, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they're still missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If 20 people think horse #2 will win, that leaves 30 people (50 total - 20).  Then, 24 of those people think horse #7 will win (60% of 40). That means 6 people must think horse #12 will win (30 total - 24).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases of shingles, and the first house needs half as many as the second, while the third needs double the first, we can set up a little equation.

Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles. That means the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Adding those together, we get x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we have 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Mike has 600 movies.  A third of those are in series, which is 200 movies. Since he can get those for a third of the price of a regular movie, that'll be 200 * ($10 / 3) = $666.67.

That leaves 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies, 240 of them, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, we can use some algebra to solve this. Let's say PJ has 'x' cards.  That means Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

If we add all their cards together, we get x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combining like terms, we have 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

So PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Turtles are much slower, though. Since they're going half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take them twice as long.  So, one turtle would take 108 hours.

But we have four turtles! That means they'd be four times faster than one turtle.  So, it would take them 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, and we need to find the total unused length, we need to find out how much is left of each stick and add it up.

* **Stick 1:** 12 mm * (1/6) = 2 mm used, so 12 mm - 2 mm = 10 mm left
* **Stick 2:** 12 mm * (2/3) = 8 mm used, so 12 mm - 8 mm = 4 mm left
* **Stick 3:** 12 mm * (1/2) = 6 mm used, so 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm left

Now, let's add up the unused portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

* Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

* Anne has F - 12 books.
* Sofie has F + 13 books.

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms:

3F = 84

Dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories (600 / 3 = 200) and each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories (450 / 3 = 150).

So, all the cinnamon rolls have 40,000 calories (200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000) and all the muffins have 45,000 calories (300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000).

That means in total, Andrew's pastries have 85,000 calories (40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000).

"Let's break this down!

We know the three ages add up to 100.  Paul is older than John by 10 years, and Peter's age is the total of Paul's and John's ages.  

If we think of it like this:

*  John's age + Paul's age + Peter's age = 100

And we know:

* Paul's age = John's age + 10
* Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

We can put it all together to figure out Peter's age.

"Okay, let's break this down.  The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45.  

If they run 24/7 for a month (30 days), the Widgeteer 3000 will make 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 will earn 43,200 * $6 = $259,200. The WidgetMaster 9000 will earn 32,400 * $6 = $194,400.

That means Fern will make $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

If Bahati scored the most, and scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra to solve for Azibo's points.

Let's say Azibo scored ""x"" points.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, their points add up to 45: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12 = 1332).

So, Pat can fit 44.4 plants in her bed (1332 / 30 = 44.4). Since she can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants in total.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17 = 28).

Let's see... if there are 50 porcupines and 3/5 are female, that means there are 30 females.  If each female has 4 babies a month, that's 120 babies born each month! Over a whole year, that's 1440 babies.  

Adding those to the original population, there would be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find the pool's volume: 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Then, we multiply that by 5.9 to find the gallons: 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the gallons by the price per gallon: 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00

It will cost the Smiths $826.00 to fill their pool.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students.  A quarter of those older students are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys under 16, leaving 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means they still need to pump 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"Hmm, this sounds like a tricky battery problem! Let's see...

Okay, so the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, then 7% each hour for another 3 hours. That's a total of 45% + 21% = 66% lost.

That means 34% of the charge was left before Maria's friends started using it.  Since it ended up at 28%, her friends must have used 6% of the power bank's capacity.

If 6% represents the charge her friends used, and that was part of the 34% remaining after the initial losses, then the original charge must have been higher.

Let me see... 6% is what percentage of 34%?

Ah, got it! 6% is about 17.65% of the original charge.

* Finally, after the third year, the price will be $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92.

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots will cost about $139 after three years.

"Let's break this down!

If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones cost $4, then large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

She had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left. Then she lost half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone. She had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.  Then she found 8 blue balloons and kept 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

If the third person got twice what the second person got, and the second person got $80 more than the first, we can use some algebra to solve this.

Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.

Adding all their shares together, we get: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

"Okay, let's figure this out!

James walks 2 miles to the halfway point, then 2 miles back home, and finally 2 miles to the store. That's a total of 6 miles.

"Let's see... 10 bunches of bananas at 4 bananas per bunch is a total of 40 bananas.  If she bought them individually, that would be 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00. Since she bought them in bunches for $3.00 each, it cost her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.  She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"Let's figure this out! If they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, we can set up a little equation.  Let's say Sam gets ""x"" feet of fence. Harry gets ""x + 60"" feet.  

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Combining the ""x"" terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2x = 40.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 20.

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings. 

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half the price of an MTB), bringing in 45 * $250 = $11,250.
* That leaves 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, for a total of 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding all those up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from bike sales that month.

"Well, that's easy! If the farmer makes 5 bales an hour and works for 6 hours, that's 5 times 6, or 30 bales. The truck takes away 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 times 6, or 18 bales.  That means there are 30 minus 18, or 12 bales left in the field.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

John has 8 classes a day (6 normal + 2 extra) at 40 minutes each, so that's 8 * 40 = 320 minutes of class each day.

Over a week, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

He spends another 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes on each weekend day learning, for a total of 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

Adding it all up, John spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes learning each week.

That's 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours!

"Okay, let's figure out how much paint Tony needs!

*  The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet per wall.
* Since there are two of those walls, that's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.
* The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, which is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet per wall.
* With two of those walls, that's 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.
* In total, the room has 160 + 80 = 240 square feet of wall space.
* Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.
* At $12 per gallon, the paint will cost 12 * $12 = $144.

Over 3 hours, they'll be 90 miles/hour * 3 hours = 270 miles apart.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

* Frying pan discount: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
* Towel discount: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Now, let's find the prices after the discounts:

* Frying pan price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
* Towel price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 saved annually.

To reach her goal, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Nik has a lot of crayons!  If he puts 8 crayons in each box, he'll need 25 boxes (200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes).

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, all the crayons together weigh 200 ounces (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces).

The boxes also weigh something!  With each box weighing 8 ounces, all the boxes together weigh 200 ounces (25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces).

That means everything together weighs 400 ounces (200 ounces crayons + 200 ounces boxes = 400 ounces).

Finally, we need to convert ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight is 25 pounds (400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The first two complexes have a total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
* The third complex is 60% bigger than that, meaning it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
* So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.
* That means he collects from a total of 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* Since he collects from each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
* At $0.40 per collection, he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

"Well, avocado trees are pretty amazing! They take a few years to really get going, but once they do, they can produce a lot of fruit.  

Here's how it breaks down:

* A 5-year-old tree gives you 50 avocados.
* By year 6, that jumps to 150 avocados.
* Year 7 is even better with 350 avocados!
* An 8-year-old tree produces a bit less than a 10-year-old, about 800 avocados.
* A 10-year-old tree is a real champ, giving you a whopping 1000 avocados!

So, over 10 years, that's a total of 2350 avocados!

"Let's break this problem down!

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can figure out how long the red rope is.

Think of it like this:

*  If the blue rope was the same length as the yellow rope, the red rope would be four times that length.
* Since the blue rope is shorter, the red rope is still four times that shorter length.

Let's use some math to find the answer! 


The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this down! Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, so she started with $15.  Since she gave the same amount to her sister as Ronnie did, and she has 4/5 of her money left, she must have given away 1/5 of her money. That means she gave $3 to her sister. Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister, leaving him with $2.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

If he triples that, he has 20 * 3 = 60 twenty-dollar bills. That's 60 * 20 = $1200.  Finally, he trades those in for fives, giving him 1200 / 5 = 240 five-dollar bills.

"Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, which is 2 fewer than Team A's 4 goals. In the second half, Team B scored 4 times their first-half amount, meaning they scored 8 goals. Team A scored half as many goals as Team B in the second half, so they scored 2 goals.  

Adding up all the goals, Team A scored a total of 6 goals (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match.

"Let's see... he started with 5 inches and used 45%, leaving him with 55% or 2.75 inches.  He uses 20% a day, so that means he has enough chalk for 2.75 inches / (0.20 * 5 inches/day) = 2.75 days.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age both now and in the future.  

Let's use ""w"" for Wendy's current age and ""c"" for Colin's current age.

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we know w = 5c + 35.

Substituting that into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying and solving for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

So Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's see... each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books.  That's a total of 55 books per bookcase (10 + 10 + 20 + 15).  Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 2 bookcases.

"Let's figure out Rose's profit!

* She spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozens, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.
* She has 60 eggs (5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen).
* She can sell those in 20 groups of 3 eggs (60 eggs / 3 eggs/group = 20 groups).
*  Selling each group for $1.00 means she'll make 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.
* Her profit is her earnings minus her costs: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

"That's easy!  If half of Skyler's hats are red, that's 50 red hats. Then, 50 hats are left. If 3/5 of those are blue, that's 30 blue hats.  That means Skyler has 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Ooh, fun party! Let's see... if she made 116 total and the blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, we can figure this out.  

Let's say she made 's' strawberry cubes. That means she made 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

If we add those together, we get the total: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining the 's' terms, we have 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that s = 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"Let's figure out how much water Crista needs!

* The plants needing half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.
* The plants needing a full cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups of water.
* That leaves 8 plants that need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water every day.
