*  g = s + 30 (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate 'g':

Simplifying the equation:

* 2s + 30 = 110
* 2s = 80

"This problem can be easily solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let 'w' represent the number of wins and 'l' represent the number of losses. We know the following:

*  w + l = 22  (The total number of games played is 22)
*  w = l + 8 (The team won 8 more games than they lost)

We can solve for 'w' using substitution. Since we know w = l + 8, we can substitute that into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2l + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2l = 14

Dividing both sides by 2:

l = 7

Now that we know l = 7, we can substitute that back into the equation w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8

We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's initially, meaning Lylah's salary represented 100/130 (or approximately 76.92%) of Adrien's. Since Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, Lylah earned approximately $30,769.23.

Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which is a $16,000 increase, bringing his salary to $56,000.  Because their salaries increased simultaneously and proportionally, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, which is $12,307.69, bringing her salary to $43,076.92.

Adding their salaries four years later, we get a combined total of $99,076.92.

2.  *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
3.  *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we want to find the number of worker bees, let's substitute the expressions for 'b' and 'w' from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

Solving this system of differential equations with the given initial conditions will give us the amount of water in the small pool now, *S(t)*.

Since the rates of change are constant, we can directly integrate to find the solutions:

* *B(t) = -4t + C₂*

Using the initial conditions, we can solve for the constants *C₁* and *C₂*.

"This problem requires a careful analysis of the point distribution and the conditional bonus structure.  

Let's break it down:

* **Mike:** Starts with 21 points.
* **Jim:** Has 3 fewer points than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* **Tony:** Has twice the points of Mike, meaning Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, for the bonus points:

* **Mike:** Earns 1 bonus point because he has over 20 points.
* **Jim:** Does not earn a bonus point as he has less than 20 points.
* **Tony:** Earns 1 bonus point because he has over 20 points.

Finally, we sum up the total points:

We know the following:

1.  Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age: n - 6 = (c - 6) / 2
2. Cera is currently 46 years old: c = 46
3. Six years ago, Chile's population was 3000 times Noah's age: p / 2 = 3000(n - 6)

"This problem can be easily solved by setting up a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of cows and 'h' represent the number of chickens. We know the following:

*  c + h = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
*  h = 2c (There are twice as many chickens as cows)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate 'h':

c + 2c = 60

c = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can substitute this value back into the equation h = 2c to find the number of chickens:

h = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, we calculate the total number of legs:

"Let's break this down.  We know Billy spent $2.00 on gumballs, which means he had $8.00 left after buying candy. Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he had $16.00 in change total. This means the candy cost $10.00 - $16.00 = $4.00.

Finally, at $1.50 per pound, Billy bought $4.00 / $1.50/pound = 2.67 pounds of candy.

"This is a classic distance-based problem.  

First, we need to find the total distance of a single round trip:

*  The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles going from the first city to the third city.
* It then travels 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles returning to the first city.
* A complete round trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since the train makes three round trips daily, it covers 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

Finally, to determine how many days the train can operate before needing service, we divide the total service interval by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Let's break this problem down using variables and equations.

* Let 'x' represent the original price of the tattered jeans.
* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they originally cost x - 6 dollars.

The total original cost of both pairs of jeans is x + (x - 6) = 2x - 6.

We know Cole saved a total of $6, so the sale price of both pairs is 2x - 6 - 6 = 2x - 12.

Let 'y' represent the amount Cole saved on the tattered jeans.  He saved 1/3 of the total savings on the jogger jeans, which means he saved (1/3)*6 = $2 on the jogger jeans.

Therefore, y = 6 - 2 = $4 was saved on the tattered jeans.

The sale price of the tattered jeans is x - y = x - 4.

The sale price of the jogger jeans is (x - 6) - 2 = x - 8.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28 on sale, we have the equation: x - 4 = 28.

Solving for x, we find that x = 32.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost x - 6 = 32 - 6 = $26.

The jogger jeans originally cost $26 - $32 = -$6 more than the tattered jeans.

* The cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.
* The oranges cost 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.
* The peaches cost 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Finally, subtracting the total cost from the amount Verna paid, we find her change: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

"This scenario represents a classic geometric sequence.  The first term is 3 (the initial families Ali calls), and the common ratio is 3 (each family calls 3 more).

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence:

aₙ = a₁ * r^(n-1)

Where:

* aₙ is the nth term (number of families in the 4th round)
* a₁ is the first term (3)
* r is the common ratio (3)
* n is the term number (4)

"As an expert in proportional reasoning and unit conversions, I can easily determine the tire's lifespan. 

First, we establish the rotations per mile: 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile.

Next, we calculate the total rotations for Jeremy's monthly mileage: 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month.

Finally, we divide the tire's total rotation capacity by the monthly rotations to find the lifespan in months: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this situation:

* Let  'A' represent Aurelia's money.
* Let 'K' represent Kassidy's money.
* Let 'R' represent Rayna's money.

We know the following:

* A = $120 (Aurelia's money)
* K = (3/4)A  (Kassidy has 3/4 the amount Aurelia has)
* R = K + $60 (Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy)

Now, to find the total amount they would have if they combined their money, we need to find A + K + R.

1. **Substitute:** Since we know A = $120, let's substitute that into the equation for K:
   K = (3/4) * $120 = $90

2. **Substitute again:** Now we know K = $90, so let's substitute that into the equation for R:
   R = $90 + $60 = $150

3. **Calculate the total:** Finally, add up the amounts for each person:
   A + K + R = $120 + $90 + $150 = $360

4. **Equal share:** To find out how much each person would have if they shared equally, divide the total by 3:
   $360 / 3 = $120

"Let's set up a system of linear equations to represent this cookie conundrum:

* Let 'K' represent the number of cookies Katarina has.
* Let 'M' represent the number of cookies Max has.
* Let 'C' represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of cookies Summer has.

We're given the following information:

* K = M - 5 
* M = C + 12
* S = M + 23
* K = 68

Now we can solve for the total number of cookies. Since we know K = 68, we can substitute that into the first equation:

* 68 = M - 5
* M = 73

Now we know Max has 73 cookies.  We can substitute this into the second equation to find the Cookie Monster's cookies:

* 73 = C + 12
* C = 61

And finally, substitute Max's cookies into the third equation to find Summer's cookies:

* S = 73 + 23
* S = 96

Now, to find the total number of cookies, add up the cookies for each person:

"Ah, a classic system of equations problem!  Let's break it down. We have two unknowns: the age of a twin ('t') and the age of a triplet ('r').

We're given two key pieces of information:

1.  One twin is 7 years older than one triplet:  t = r + 7
2.  Their combined ages total 44: 2t + 3r = 44

We can use substitution to solve for 't'. Since we know t = r + 7, let's plug that into the second equation:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Simplifying the equation:

2r + 14 + 3r = 44
5r + 14 = 44
5r = 30
r = 6

Now that we know 'r' (the age of a triplet is 6), we can easily find 't' (the age of a twin):

t = r + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this problem:

* Let  'x' be the cost of one lollipop.
* Let 'y' be the cost of one candy.

We know the following:

* Equation 1: 5x + 4y = 3.20  (The cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20)

We also know:

* Equation 2: x = 0.40 (Each lollipop costs $0.40)

Now we can substitute the value of 'x' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

* 5(0.40) + 4y = 3.20
* 2 + 4y = 3.20
* 4y = 1.20
* y = 0.30

So, one candy costs $0.30.

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

* 10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00
* 10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00

Total cost: $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"Let's break this problem down. We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long (8 feet and 4 inches).  We also know this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  

Let 'x' represent the length of Bobby's shoe. This gives us the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Finally, we divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

2. 3 + o = 8 + 2w

We can solve for 'w' (the number of white fish Bob bought) using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

1. Solve equation 1 for 'o': o = 17 - w
2. Substitute this value of 'o' into equation 2: 3 + (17 - w) = 8 + 2w
3. Simplify and solve for 'w': 20 - w = 8 + 2w => 12 = 3w => w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought **4** white fish at the store.

*  'su' represent the ounces of sugar.

We know the following:

1. **f = z** (same amount of fragrance as zest)
2. **s = 2z** (twice as much salt as zest)
3. **o = 2s** (twice as much oil as salt)
4. **su = s** (same amount of sugar as salt)
5. **z + f + s + o + su = 10** (total ounces in the jar)

Now we can substitute to solve for 'o' (the ounces of oil):

* Since f = z and su = s, we can rewrite equation 5 as: z + z + s + o + s = 10
* Substitute s = 2z into the equation: z + z + 2z + o + 2z = 10
* Combine like terms: 6z + o = 10

We are given the following information:

* x + y + z = 341  (The total number of cards)
* y = 3x           (Smendrick has 3 times PJ's cards)
* z = y + 12        (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)

We can solve this system using substitution. Since we know y = 3x and z = y + 12, we can substitute these expressions into the first equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know x = 47 (PJ's cards), we can find Becca's cards (z):

z = y + 12 = 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 's' represent the number of socks Jack has.
* Let 'd' represent the number of dishes Jack has.

We know the following:

*  d = 2s (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
*  d = 60 (Jack has 60 dishes)
*  Peter's socks = 2s (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)
*  Peter's dishes = d/2 (Peter has half as many dishes as Jack)

Since we know d = 60, we can substitute that into the first equation:

60 = 2s

Solving for 's', we find Jack has 30 socks.

Now we can find the total number of socks:

Peter's socks + Jack's socks = 2(30) + 30 = 90

And the total number of dishes:

Peter's dishes + Jack's dishes = 60/2 + 60 = 90

Finally, the total number of socks and dishes:

90 + 90 = 180

We are given the following information:

1.  x = y - 3 
2.  x = z + 2
3.  w = 3y - 1
4.  x + y + z + w = 87

Now we can substitute equations 1 and 2 into equation 4:

Substitute equation 1 into the above equation:

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this situation.

* Let  'x' represent the yards of material needed per small mask.
* Let 'y' represent the yards of material needed per large mask.

We know the following:

*  4 small masks require 2 yards of material: 4x = 2
*  3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material: 3y = 2.25

Solving for x and y:

* x = 2 / 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask
* y = 2.25 / 3 = 0.75 yards per large mask

Now we can calculate the total material needed:

* 20 small masks: 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards
* 8 large masks: 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards

Total material: 10 + 6 = 16 yards

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd' and Adam's current age by 'a'.

* We know that ""Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago."" This translates to the equation:  d - 8 = 2(a - 4)
* We also know that ""Duncan's age is 60 now"". This means: d = 60

Now we can substitute the value of 'd' from the second equation into the first equation:

60 - 8 = 2(a - 4)

Simplifying the equation:

52 = 2a - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

60 = 2a

Dividing both sides by 2:

a = 30

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find his age in 8 years, we simply add 8:

30 + 8 = 38

"This problem can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as Pa, and John's age as J.

We are given the following information:

* Pa = J + 10
* P = Pa + J

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to eliminate Pa:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, substitute both the expression for Pa and the expression for P into the first equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation:

"This problem can be solved efficiently by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's denote:

*  Adelwolfe's Pokemon count as 'A'
*  Stan's Pokemon count as 'S'
*  Alex's Pokemon count as 'X'

We're given the following relationships:

1. S = 4A - 13 
2. X = S + 5
3. A + S + X = 339

Substituting equations 1 and 2 into equation 3, we eliminate X and S, leaving an equation with only A. Solving for A, we get A = 40.

Now, substitute the value of A back into equation 1 to find S:

S = 4(40) - 13 = 147

"Given the varying stringing times for each racquet type, we need to calculate a weighted average to determine the total time. 

* Synthetic gut contributes (3 racquets / 12 total racquets) * 15 minutes/racquet = 3.75 minutes
* Polyester contributes (5 racquets / 12 total racquets) * 22 minutes/racquet = 9.17 minutes
* Hybrid contributes (4 racquets / 12 total racquets) * 18 minutes/racquet = 6 minutes

Summing these weighted times gives us a total of 3.75 + 9.17 + 6 = 18.92 minutes per racquet.

Since Andy needs to string 12 racquets, the total time is 18.92 minutes/racquet * 12 racquets = 227.04 minutes.

"Let's set up a system of equations to solve this:

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Robert has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
* Let 'Ri' represent the number of cherries Richard has.

We know:

* R = 30 (Robert has 30 cherries)
* R = Ri + 10 (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)
* R + Ri + J = 60 (The total number of cherries is 60)

Now we can solve for J:

1. Since R = 30 and R = Ri + 10, we know Ri = 20 (Richard has 20 cherries).
2. Substitute the values of R and Ri into the third equation: 30 + 20 + J = 60
3. Simplify: 50 + J = 60
4. Solve for J: J = 10 (Jerry has 10 cherries)

* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, he spent a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Now, subtract that from his starting amount to see how much he has left: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75.

Finally, divide the remaining money by the price of each plum to find out how many he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this situation:

We know the following:

*  y = 2x (Twice as many small stuffed animals were sold as large ones)
* 12x + 4y = 120 (Earnings from large + earnings from small equals total earnings)

Now we can use substitution to solve for our variables. Since we know y = 2x, substitute '2x' for 'y' in the second equation:

Simplify and solve for 'x':

* 12x + 8x = 120

Now that we know x = 6, we can plug it back into the equation y = 2x to find 'y':

x = 20

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Let's break down this sales problem step by step.

* **Trekking Bikes:**  We know 1/2 of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so that's 300 * (1/2) = 150 Trekking bikes.

* **BMX Bikes:**  15% of the bikes were BMX, meaning 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold.

* **MTB Bikes:** The rest were MTB bikes, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

* **Earnings:**

    * Trekking: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
    * BMX: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250 (since BMX bikes cost half the price of MTB bikes)
    * MTB: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

"Ah, a classic geometric sequence problem! The height of the ball after each bounce forms a geometric sequence with a first term of 72 feet and a common ratio of 2/3.  To find the height of the second bounce, we simply need the second term of this sequence.

The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a*r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number.

In this case, the second term (n=2) is 72 * (2/3)^(2-1) = 72 * (2/3) = 48 feet.

However, the question asks for the height of the *second* bounce, which is the height after the ball has bounced *once* and then comes back up.  Therefore, we need the *third* term of the sequence.

The third term is 72 * (2/3)^(3-1) = 72 * (2/3)^2 = 72 * (4/9) = 32 feet.

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We know the following:

* A = M  (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)
* C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah's total)
* C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)
* A + M + C + S = 56 (Total eggs painted)

We can solve for our variables. Since A = M, we can substitute:

* 2A + C + S = 56

Now, substitute C = S + 12:

* 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56
* 2A + 2S + 12 = 56
* 2A + 2S = 44

Substitute C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30:

* (S + 12) + S = 30
* 2S + 12 = 30
* 2S = 18
* S = 9

Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs.  We can find Camden's eggs:

* C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21

Finally, find Arnold's eggs (remembering A = M):

* 2A + 2(9) = 44
* 2A + 18 = 44
* 2A = 26
* A = 13

Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

* **Sidewalk:** The sidewalk rate is twice the beach rate, so it's 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

* **Sidewalk Time:** We know the sidewalk distance (1 mile) and the rate (6 miles per hour). We can find the time: time = distance / rate = 1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour. Converting to minutes: (1/6 hour) * (60 minutes/hour) = 10 minutes.

* **Total Time:**  The total walk time is the beach time plus the sidewalk time: 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

"Let's set up a linear inequality to represent this situation.

* Let 'x' be the temperature of the unknown water.

We know the final mixture must be at least 40 degrees.  The total ""degree-ounces"" contributed by each mug will be:

* 33-degree water: 33 degrees * 4 ounces = 132 degree-ounces
* Unknown water: x degrees * 1 ounce = x degree-ounces

The total degree-ounces in the mixture is 132 + x. Since the mixture is 5 ounces total, the average temperature is (132 + x) / 5.

This average temperature must be greater than or equal to 40 degrees:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

Now we solve for x:

132 + x >= 200
x >= 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least **68 degrees**.

"Let's set up a system of equations to solve this problem.

* Let  'x' represent the number of individual sunflowers sold.
* Let 'y' represent the number of bouquets sold.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1 (Earnings from sunflowers):** 2x + 8y = 26 * 3  (He earns $2 per individual sunflower and $8 per bouquet, and we're looking at earnings over 3 days)
* **Equation 2 (Earnings from sunflowers in bouquets):** 12y =  (56 / 8) * 3 (Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, and we need to find the total number of sunflowers sold in bouquets over 3 days)

Simplifying Equation 2:

* 12y = 21

Solving for 'y':

* y = 21 / 12 = 1.75

Since Faraday can't sell parts of bouquets, he sold 1 whole bouquet per day.

Now, let's plug the value of 'y' back into Equation 1:

* 2x + 8(1.75) = 78
* 2x + 14 = 78
* 2x = 64
* x = 32

Therefore, Faraday sold a total of 32 individual sunflowers + 1.75 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 32 + 21 = 53 sunflowers over 3 days.

We know the following:

* J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
* C = 2Ca (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)

To find the total number of seashells, we need to find C, J, and Ca. We can use substitution to solve for our variables:

"This problem can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let's break it down:

* Let 'r' be the length of the red rope.
* Let 'b' be the length of the blue rope.
* Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.

We're given the following relationships:

1.  r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
2.  b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3.  r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

We can solve for 'r' (the length of the red rope) using substitution. 

From equation (2), we know b = y - 7. Substitute this into equation (1):

r = 4(y - 7)

Simplify: r = 4y - 28

Now substitute both 'r' and 'b' from the above equations into equation (3):

(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

Combine like terms: 6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides: 6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6: y = 12

Now that we know y = 12, substitute it back into b = y - 7:

b = 12 - 7 = 5

"Let's break this down.  We need to calculate the total number of candles and flashlights.

* **Flashlights:** With 4 people, and one flashlight per person, they have 4 flashlights.

* **Small Candles:** Half the rooms (8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, for a total of 16 small candles (4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 candles).

* **Medium Candles:** The other half of the rooms (8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, totaling 20 medium candles (4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 candles).

* **Total Candles:**  Adding the small and medium candles, they have 36 candles (16 candles + 20 candles = 36 candles).

* **Grand Total:** Combining the candles and flashlights, they have 40 light sources (36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40).

* **Determine the total revenue:** $80 + $20 = $100
* **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:** $100 / 50 = $2.00

"Ah, a classic age word problem! These can be tricky, but with a systematic approach, they're easily solved. 

Let's break it down:

* **Dora's age:** Dora turns 12 in 3 years, meaning she's currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* **James's age:** James is twice Dora's age, so he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's age:** John was 19 when James was born, making him 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.
* **Youngest son's age:** John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* **Youngest son's age in 3 years:** In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Ah, a classic rate problem!  We can easily determine the difference in oranges peeled by considering their individual peeling rates.

Ana peels at a rate of 1 orange every 3 minutes, which translates to 20 oranges per hour. Jane, on the other hand, peels at a rate of 1 orange every 4 minutes, resulting in 15 oranges peeled per hour.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Let's break down the costs:

* The radiator discount is 80% of $400, which is $320.
* This brings the radiator price down to $400 - $320 = $80.
* The mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, totaling $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the radiator cost and the mechanic's fee, the total cost is $80 + $150 = $230.

"This problem can be easily solved by setting up a system of linear equations. Let 'c' represent the number of chickens and 'w' represent the number of cows. We know:

*  c + w = 20  (The total number of animals is 20)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' using substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w': w = 20 - c
2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 => -2c = -10 => c = 5



Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
