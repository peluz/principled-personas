"Well, lemme see... she gets 16 eggs, eats 3, and uses 4 for bakin'. That's 7 gone, right? So she's got 9 left.  She sells 'em for 2 bucks a pop, so that's... 9 times 2...  

$18 

"
"You need two of the blue, and half of that for the white, so that's one white.  That's three all together.

"
"Well, lemme see... He bought the house for 80,000 and put in 50,000 more, so that's 130,000 already.  Then it went up by 150%, so that's like... a whole lotta more money.  Hmm... 150% of 80,000 is...  carry the one...  120,000!  So now it's worth 200,000!  

He made 70,000 bucks!


$70,000
"
"Well, lemme see... he runs three of them sprints three times a week, right? And each one is sixty meters long. So that's, uh... three times three is nine. And nine times sixty...  carry the one... that's 540 meters! 


540
"
"Well, lemme see... she gives 'em 15 cups in the mornin' and 25 in the afternoon, so that's 40 cups already.  If she's got 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, that's 60 cups total.  So she needs to give 'em another 20 cups at night.


20 

"
"Lemme see... he buys one glass for five bucks, then the next one's cheaper, right?  So, like, half price?  Nah, sixty percent... that's a little more than half.  So, um, if he buys sixteen glasses, that's eight pairs.  Eight times eight... hmm... that's sixty-four dollars!


$64 

"
"Well, lemme see... Seattle's got 20 sheep, right? And Charleston's got four times that, so that's 20 times 4, which is 80 sheep. Now, Toulouse has double Charleston's sheep, so that's 80 times 2, which makes 160 sheep.  

If you add 'em all up, that's 20 plus 80 plus 160...  

260 

"
"Well, lemme see... she was downloadin' that big ol' file, right?  200 gigabytes, that's a lot! She was gettin' it done at 2 gigs a minute, but then that darn computer had to go and update itself. Took 20 minutes, can you believe that?  So she had to start all over.

Let's see... she got 40% done before the update, so that's like 80 gigs.  Then she had to download all 200 gigs again.  

Hmm, that's a lot of downloadin'.  I'd say it took her a good while, maybe like 2 hours?


120 

"
"Well, lemme see... He drove for 3 hours at 60, so that's 3 times 60, which is 180 miles. Then he sits still for 2 hours, so he ain't goin' nowhere. Then he goes slow for a bit, 30 miles an hour for half an hour, so that's 15 miles.  Then he goes real fast, 80 miles an hour for... lemme see... 4 hours minus 2 hours minus half an hour... that's 1 and a half hours. So that's 80 times 1.5, which is 120 miles.

So he went 15 plus 120, that's 135 miles back towards home. But he went 180 miles out first, so he's 180 minus 135, which is 45 miles from home.



45
"
"She worked 40 hours at 10 bucks an hour, so that's 400 bucks.  Then she got 5 extra hours at time and a half, so that's 5 times 12 bucks, which is 60 bucks.  So she made 400 plus 60, which is 460 bucks.


$460 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 60 downloads the first month. Then, three times that is... uh... 180!  But then they lost some in the third month, 30% of 180 is... hmm...  that's like, a little more than half of 180, so maybe 90?  So that means they had 180 - 90, which is 90 downloads that month.

So, all together, that's 60 + 180 + 90...  carry the one... that's 330 downloads!


330 

"
"Lemme see... she got 3 of them donut boxes, and each one cost 68 bucks, so that's 3 times 68...  carry the 2... that's 204 bucks. Then she got 2 boxes of them little cupcakes, 80 bucks a box, so that's 2 times 80...  160 bucks. And then them cheesecake things, 6 boxes times 55 bucks...  that's 330 bucks.

Now, add it all up... 204 plus 160 plus 330...  that's 694 bucks!

"
"Lemons are good money, but that tree costs a lot to start!  You make $10.50 from the lemons each year, but it costs $3 to take care of it. So that's $7.50 profit each year.  

You gotta make $90 back, so it'll take 12 years to start makin' real money.

"
"Well, lemme see... she had some vacuums, right? Sold a bunch at the green place, then a couple more at the red one.  Then she sold half of what was left at the orange place.  She ended up with 5.  

Hmm... that's tricky.  If she had 5 left, and that was half of what she had after the red house, she musta had 10 before the orange house.  

Now, if she had 10 before the orange house, and she sold a couple at the red house, she musta had 12 before that.

And if she had 12 before the red house, and that was 2/3 of what she started with, she musta started with 18!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 kids in class, and some like that fancy dancin', some like the jazzy stuff...  That leaves a good chunk for hip-hop, I bet.  Gotta be more than half, right?

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he buys shiny stuff for five thousand bucks, it goes up by a little bit, right?  Two and a half percent... that's like... not much, but it's somethin'.  

The gadgets are more money, eight thousand, but they only go up a little, one point two percent.  

I think the shiny stuff would make more money, 'cause even though it starts lower, it goes up more.

**Answer:** 125 



"
"Well, they went 80 miles one way, then another 150 miles.  So that's gotta be... 230 miles total, right?


230 

"
"Lemme see... she makes 20 bucks an hour teachin' and 30 bucks an hour coachin'.  She teaches 35 hours a week, so that's 20 times 35...  carry the one... that's 700 bucks a week just teachin'.  Then she coaches 15 hours a week at 30 bucks an hour, so that's 15 times 30...  that's 450 bucks a week coachin'.  So she makes 700 plus 450, which is 1150 bucks a week.  Now, there's 50 weeks in a year, so 1150 times 50...  that's a lotta money!  57,500 bucks a year!

57500 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she eats 3 eggs every day, right?  So that's like 21 eggs a week, I guess.  And in four weeks, that's... uh...  carry the one...  7 times 12 is 84.  So she eats 7 dozen eggs.


7 

"
"Well, she walked 6 miles already, and she's gotta go 6 more.  She wants to do the whole thing in 3 hours, and she's already been walkin' for 2. So she's got 1 hour left.  

If she wants to do 6 miles in 1 hour, she gotta walk 6 miles per hour.

"
"Well, lemme see... I got 10 jugs of that orange stuff, and it's mostly water, right?  Two out of every three jugs is water.  Then I got 15 jugs of pineapple, and that's mostly water too, three out of every five jugs.  But I spilled some of the orange, darn it!  One whole jug gone.

So, I gotta figure out how much water is left in all that.  That's a head-scratcher...  

Let's see... 10 jugs of orange, two-thirds water... that's like... 6 and a bit jugs of water.  And the pineapple, 15 jugs, three-fifths water... that's like 9 jugs of water.

Now, I spilled one jug of orange, so that's 6 jugs of water left from the orange.

Add that to the pineapple water, and that's 6 plus 9... 15 jugs of water!

"
"Well, Samantha's 31, and her cousin Raymond's older by 6 years, so he's 37.  Raymond had his boy when he was 23, so the kid's gotta be 37 minus 23, which is 14.  That means the little fella was born 14 years ago.


14 

"
"Billy sold 3 DVDs to the first few folks, then 2 more each to the next couple.  That's 3 plus 4, so he sold 7 DVDs.

"
"Well, it burns for four hours, right? And it gets shorter by two of them finger-length things every hour. So, it'd be shorter by... lemme see... two times four... eight! 

8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the book cost $19.50, but that's 'cause it was on sale. They took 25% off, so that means it was more expensive before.  

If 19.50 is 75% of the price, gotta figure out what 100% is.  

Let's see... 19.50 divided by 0.75...  that's 26 bucks!


$26.00 

"
"Lemme see... she spent 12 bucks on chicken, and then 15 on milk, cuz 3 bucks a pop times 5 is 15. Apples were 6 bucks, cuz they's 1.50 each and she got 4. So that's 33 bucks already.  She had 50 bucks, so that means pizza was 17 bucks. Each pizza is 8.50, so she got 2 pizzas.


2 

"
"Lemme see... three shorts at sixteen fifty... that's, uh...  carry the one... forty-nine fifty. Pants are twenty-two fifty a pop, so three of them is sixty-seven fifty. Shoes are forty-two each, so that's a hundred and twenty-six. Add it all up...  

243.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... she eats one a night, so that's 60 ice creams in 60 days.  Each box has 15, so that's 4 boxes she needs. If each box is 4 bucks, then she spends 16 dollars.


16.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He went 20 miles, then stopped. Then he stopped again 15 miles from the end, which is 60 miles total. So that means he went... 45 miles?  

25 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Them fancy shoes cost $33 and the other ones are double that, so that's $33 times 2, which is $66.  Together they cost $33 plus $66, so that's $99.  But the boots cost $5 more than that, so the boots are $99 plus $5... that's $104!


$104 

"
"Darrell and Allen, huh?  So they're like, one's older, right?  

If their ages add up to 162, and they're like 7 to 11, that means Allen's gotta be the older one.  

Hmm, lemme see... 162 divided by... what was it? 18? Yeah, 18. That's 9. So Allen's gotta be 9 times 11, which is... 99!

In ten years, he'll be 109. 


109
"
"Well, lemme see... that first fella says 80. The second one says 20 more than half of that, so that's 40 plus 20, which is 60.  The last one says 25 more than the first one, so that's 80 plus 20, which is 100.  

If you add 'em all up, that's 80 plus 60 plus 100, which is 240.  Now, to get the average, you gotta divide that by 3, 'cause there's three guesses. 240 divided by 3 is 80.


80 

"
"Well, lemme see... he walks 'em for half an hour each, and he's got ten of 'em. So that's five hours a day, right?  And there's seven days in a week... so that's... uh... carry the one... thirty-five hours!


35 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Gretchen's got a whole bunch of coins, right?  110 of 'em. And she's got more gold ones than silver ones, 30 more to be exact.  

So, if we take away those extra gold ones, she'd have the same amount of gold and silver, right? That'd be 110 coins / 2 = 55 coins of each.

But she's got 30 extra gold ones, so she must have 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.


85 

"
"Lemme see... Raymond's got a whole lotta jewels, 40! Aaron's got half of that plus a few more... so that's 20 plus 5, which is 25. Siobhan's got 2 less than Aaron, so she's got... 23!


23
"
"He played for a long time!  Let's see... he got 4 points, then more points, like 1 more point, I think. So that's 5 points.  Then add the first points... 4 plus 5 is 9!

"
"Well, lemme see... he eats two a day, so that's sixty yogurts in a month.  Those yogurt deals are four for five bucks, so... hmm... lemme count... that's fifteen of them deals. Fifteen times five...  carry the one... that's seventy-five dollars!


$75.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... He sold his Legos for fifteen bucks a pop, and he had thirteen of 'em. That's, uh... carry the one...  $195!  Then he bought them video games, eight of 'em at twenty bucks each.  That's a lotta money, $160!  He had five bucks left over, so he musta had $165 before buyin' the games.  

So, he sold enough Legos to get $165.  That's... eleven sets.  He started with thirteen, so he's gotta have two left.


2 

"
"Well, he runs 60 miles in a whole week, and he runs three days.  So that's 60 miles split up over three days.  Hmm, that's 20 miles a day.  But he runs longer one day.  He runs 3 hours that day, and half that the other two days. So that's 1.5 hours each of the other days.

That's a lot of runnin'!


10 

"
"Well, lemme see... she skips at 3 miles an hour, and that's half as fast as she runs, so she runs at 6 miles an hour.  Walkin' is slower, gotta be, right? She runs four times faster than she walks, so she walks at 1.5 miles an hour.

She runs for a third of the time, so that's 2 hours outta the 6.  That means she runs 12 miles (6 times 2).

Walkin' takes up the rest of the time, so 4 hours.  She walks 6 miles doin' that (1.5 times 4).

Add it all up, and she goes 18 miles.

"
"Well, Suzy's phone is brand new, just a year old. Ben's phone is older, like twice as old as Suzy's, so that's two years. Now, Brandon's phone is super old, like four times older than Ben's. So, that's four times two... lemme see...

"
"Well, that there dragon breathes fire real far, like a whole thousand feet!  But Polly can chuck that shiny javelin four hundred feet, so she's gotta be careful.  Now, if she holds that blue sparkly rock, she can throw it three times as far, so that's... twelve hundred feet!  That means she can stand two hundred feet away from the fire and still hit that dragon. 


200 

"
"Well, lemme see... she baked 5 pies, and each one had 8 slices, so that's a whole lotta pie!  That's 5 times 8, which is... um... 40 pieces!  And if there were 14 left over, then they musta ate 26 pieces. 


26 

"
"Well, lemme see...  You got 200 calories left, and each bag has 250 in it, but it's split into 5 parts. So that's like 50 calories per part. You can have 200 divided by 50, which is 4 parts.  Each part is 300 grams split by 5, so that's 60 grams per part.  So you can eat 4 parts times 60 grams, which is 240 grams.

240 

"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 10 candles outta each pound o' wax, and he needs enough for 20 candles. So that's 2 pounds of wax, right?  

That wax and the stringy things cost him 10 bucks a pound, so that's 20 bucks total. He sells each candle for 2 bucks, so 20 candles is 40 bucks.

If he makes 40 bucks and spends 20, that means he makes a profit of 20 bucks.


$20.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... she writes 5 stories on Monday, then a couple more on Tuesday, so that's like 7 stories. Then on Wednesday, she writes double Tuesday's amount, so that's 14 stories.  That's a whole lotta stories!  

So, 5 plus 7 plus 14... that's 26 stories.  And each one takes 4 hours, so she spent 26 times 4 hours writin'.

104 



"
"She started with 80, used a bunch at work, and had 23 left.  So she musta bought a whole lotta Post-its!  

Let's see... 80 plus all the ones she used is 300.  Then take away the ones she had left... 300 minus 23 is 277.

277 

"
"Well, lemme see... he bought 5 blue ties at 40 bucks a pop, so that's 200 bucks right there.  He got twice as many red ones, so that's 10 red ties.  Those red ones cost more, like 60 bucks each 'cause they're fancier. So 10 times 60 is 600 bucks.  Add that to the blue ones and he spent a whole lotta money, 800 bucks!


$800 

"
"Well, lemme see... she had 4 feet of wire, right? And each piece is 6 inches.  A foot is 12 inches, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 inches of wire.  Then you gotta divide that by 6... 48 divided by 6 is 8.

8 

"
"Well, lemme see... Fifteen floors, eight apartments on each floor... that's a lotta apartments!  So that's, uh... fifteen times eight... carry the one...  one hundred and twenty apartments total.  

Now, they say three-quarters are full, so that's... hmm...  Three-quarters of one hundred and twenty...  That's a lot of countin'!  

Let's see...  If three-quarters are full, then one-quarter ain't.  So, one-quarter of one hundred and twenty...  That's gotta be thirty!


30 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 252 eggs every day, right?  And there's 7 days in a week, so that's a whole lotta eggs!  Let's see... 252 times 7...  carry the one... that's 1764 eggs! Now, he sells 'em for 2 bucks a dozen, so... 1764 divided by 12...  that's a bunch of dozens...  

*counts on fingers*

...that's 147 dozen.  So, 147 times 2...  that's 294 dollars!


294 

"
"Well, he went out for 3 hours, right?  And he was goin' 10 miles an hour, so that's 30 miles.  Comin' back slower, 6 miles an hour... hmm...  That's gonna take him 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He took out 30 comic books, and those are light, right?  So he still gotta take out some toys.  If each toy is half a pound, and he needs to take out 15 pounds total, that's... 15 toys. 


15 

"
"Well, lemme see...

He fixed 6 big truck tires at 60 bucks a pop, so that's 6 times 60... hmm... carry the one... that's 360 bucks.

Then he did 4 car tires at 40 bucks each, so that's 4 times 40...  160 bucks.

So Thursday he made 360 plus 160... that's 520 bucks.

Friday he only did cars, 12 of 'em at 40 bucks each... that's 12 times 40... 480 bucks.

So he made more on Thursday, by... 520 minus 480... that's 40 bucks more.


40 

"
"Well, lemme see... they brought home 7 kitties, right? And Patchy had a whole bunch more, like three times that many!  That's 7 times 3, which is... uh... 21!  And Trixie had 12. So that's 21 plus 12, which is... 33 kitties from the momma cats!  

Now, add those to the 7 they brought home... 33 plus 7... that's a lotta kitties! 40!


40 

"
"Jean had some candy, then ate some.  She has 28 left.  If she puts two in each bag, she can make 14 bags. 


14
"
"Well, lemme see... he spends 7 bucks on a ticket and 7 more on popcorn, so that's 14 bucks every time he goes.  If he's got 42 bucks, he can go 3 times. 


3
"
"Hmm, lemme see... that truck can carry 5000 pounds, but it's already got 3755 pounds in it. So that leaves 1245 pounds for the boxes.  Each box is 15 pounds, so...  

... 83 boxes. 


83
"
"Lemme see... so he had to pay forty bucks for the food, right? Then they added some extra 'cause it was delivered, like ten bucks, I think? And then three more bucks for bringin' it.  Plus a tip, four bucks.  So, uh... forty plus ten plus three plus four... that's fifty-seven bucks!


$57.00 

"
"Lemme see... six bunches of raspberries, twenty in each... that's a lotta raspberries!  So that's, uh...  carry the one...  120! And then there's some more just hangin' around, 67 of 'em.  So, 120 plus 67...  

187 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Got 25 oranges, right? One's bad, some ain't ripe yet, and a couple are sour.  That leaves a whole lotta good ones.  I'd say there's gotta be 'bout 17 good oranges left.


17 

"
"Well, lemme see... she spent 500 on the shiny stuff and then another 800 for the fella to make it all pretty. That's 1300 already.  Then she gotta pay some more for insurance, right?  10% of 1300... hmm... that's 130 more. So, all together, it cost her 1430 bucks!


$1430 

"
"Well, she gets 50,000 a year, right? And then after 20 years, she gets extra money, 5% of that 50,000 every year. So that's 2,500 more dollars each year.  So, it's 50,000 plus 2,500...

$52,500 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she pays 140 bucks every month, right? That's like, a lotta money for watchin' shows!

So, six months is half a year, so that's 140 times 6... which is 840 bucks.

Then they give her a discount, 10% off, so that's like... 14 bucks less each month.

So now it's 140 minus 14, which is 126 bucks a month.

Another six months of that is 126 times 6... which is 756 bucks.

Now we gotta add those two together... 840 plus 756...  that's 1596 bucks!

1596 



"
"Well, she went 100 miles on 4 gallons, so that's 25 miles for every gallon. Her tank holds 12 gallons, so she can go 25 times 12...

"
"Well, lemme see... He watches the boob tube for two hours, then reads for an hour, right? So that's three hours a day. And he does that three times a week.  That's nine hours a week.  Now, if he does that for four weeks, that's... hmm...  carry the one...  36 hours!

"
"Lemme see... four schools, two teams each, five players on a team... that's ten players per school. And they got two coaches too, so that's twelve people per school.  Four schools times twelve people...  carry the one... that's 48 people! 


48
"
"Well, lemme see...  They had a whole bunch o' diamonds, 175 of 'em! And then they had some rubies, but not as many as diamonds, 'bout 35 less.  So that's... lemme count on my fingers... 140 rubies.  And then they had even more emeralds, twice as many as the rubies.  So that's 280 emeralds!  

Now, to get the total, we gotta add 'em all up: 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds...  

*counts on fingers*

That's a whole lotta gems! 595! 


595
"
"Well, lemme see...  There's twice as many boys as girls, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 boys.  That's a lotta boys!  So all together there's 120 plus 60, which is 180 kids.  And if there's 5 kids to every teacher, that's 180 divided by 5...  carry the one...  that's 36 teachers!


36 

"
"Well, she got $5 every week for 8 weeks, so that's 5 times 8, which is 40 bucks.  That means she had 100 - 40 = 60 dollars to start with.


$60 

"
"Well, lemme see... she teaches a whole lotta classes, right? Five each day, that's like, a bunch! And then eight more on Saturday?  That's gotta be a lot of kids.  Fifteen kids in each class, so... that's a lot of money! Fifteen dollars each, so... hmm...  

Let's see... carry the one...  

$7425.00 



"
"That's a lotta steps!  So the first one has 20, and the second one has double that, so that's 40.  If you add them together, that's 60 steps to cook both.

"
"Lemme see... he sells them brownies for three bucks a pop, and he sold a whole lotta them, 43!  That's 43 times 3...  carry the one...  that's 129 bucks right there.

Now them cheesecakes, they's four bucks a slice. He sold 23 of them... so that's 23 times 4... hmm... that's 92 bucks.

Altogether, he made 129 plus 92...  that's 221 bucks!


221 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... five phones at 150 bucks a pop... that's 750 smackeroos right there.  And they're chargin' 2% interest on each one?  So that's 3 bucks extra per phone, times five phones... that's 15 bucks more. So she's gotta pay 765 bucks total.  

Spread that over three months, that's 255 bucks a month.


255 

"
"Lemme see... he sells those marigold things for 'bout 3 bucks a pop, right? So 12 of them is 36 bucks. Petunias are cheaper, like 2 bucks each, so 9 of them is 18 bucks. And them begonias, also 2 bucks a piece, so 17 of them is... lemme see... carry the one... 34 bucks!

So, 36 plus 18 plus 34... that's 88 bucks!


88 

"
"Well, lemme see... He's got four levels, right? And the tippy top one is 16.  If each one's half the size of the one under it, the one below that gotta be 32, then 64, then 128 for the big one on the bottom.  

So, you add 'em all up: 16 plus 32 plus 64 plus 128... that's 240.

Then you split that by 4 'cause there's four levels... 240 split by 4 is 60.


60 

"
"Well, lemme see... she feeds the little fella a cup a day for, what was it, 180 days?  Then it's two cups a day after that.  That's a lotta food!  A bag has 110 cups, right?  Hmm...  I reckon she'll need a good handful of bags, maybe five or six?

"
"Sarah does a whole lotta laundry, like 400 pounds! Raymond's a bit lazier, he only does half, so that's 200 pounds.  David's the real slacker, he only does a hundred pounds.  So Raymond does 100 more pounds than David.


100 

"
"Well, lemme see...  If he buys them in groups of 3, that's 6 groups for 18 flowers, right?  So that's 6 times $2.50, which is $15.  But if he gets the 2-flower packs, that's 9 packs for $1 each, so that's only $9.  

He saves $6 if he gets the smaller packs.


$6.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the groomer wants a hundred bucks, but they're givin' him a deal 'cause he's new. Thirty percent off... that's like, a third off, right?  So, a third of a hundred is... lemme think... thirty dollars!  So the groomin' costs seventy bucks.


$70 

"
"Hmm, let me see... They had 24 jugs of water, right?  And the girls took some, like a fourth of it each. So that's 24 split in half, then in half again... that's 6 jugs each for the girls.  So that's 12 jugs gone already. Then the boy took 6 more jugs.  That's 18 jugs gone altogether.  

So there's gotta be 6 jugs left.

"
"Charlie had some stickers, then got a bunch more.  He gave some away and used some, so I bet he don't got too many left.  

17 

"
"Let's see... Grace weighs 125, right? And Alex is, what, four times that minus 2?  So that's 125 times 4... hmm... that's 500.  Then take away 2... so Alex is 498. Now we gotta add them together... 125 plus 498...  

623 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Three bushes with twenty-five roses each... that's a lotta roses!  And each one has eight pokey thorns...  

Let's see...  *counts on fingers*  Three times twenty-five is seventy-five... and then seventy-five times eight...  

That's a whole bunch of thorns!  Six hundred, I think.


600 

"
"They won 15 games. 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes on four trips a year, right? And he's been doin' that since he was 23.  He's 34 now, so that's 11 years of trips.  Four trips a year... times 11 years...  

That's 44 shirts, I reckon.


44 

"
"Well, lemme see... It rang four times the first time, then three times longer the second time, so that's like... four times three, which is twelve. Then half of that the third time, so twelve cut in half is six.  So, all together, that's four plus twelve plus six...  

22 

"
"Well, lemme see... she gets 600 now, right? And they give her a raise of 10% every year after 5 years. So that's like... 60 bucks more the first year. Then another 60 bucks on top of that the next year, and so on.  

So after three years, it'd be... 600 plus 60, then plus another 60, then another 60...  

Hold on, lemme count that up... 600 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 780.

780 



"
"Well, if Marilyn sold ten times more than Harald, that's a whole lotta records!  If they sold 88,000 all together, Harald musta sold 8,000. 


8,000
"
"Well, lemme see... she invited 16 folks, but some ain't gonna come.  So she needs enough for 12, I reckon.  That's 9 bags, 'cause she needs three-quarters of a bag for each one.  And those bags cost 2 bucks a pop, so that's... 18 dollars.


$18 

"
"Well, lemme see...  Them big dinos eat a whole lotta food, 'bout 10 pounds each. Them little ones, they eat half that, so 5 pounds.  Got 20 big ones and 5 little ones...  

*writes on a napkin*

20 times 10 is 200...  and 5 times 5 is 25...  

Add those together... 200 plus 25...  

That's 225 pounds of potato salad!  Hope that's enough!


225 

"
"Well, Cindy's got four little critters. Marcia's got two more than that, so that's six.  Jan's got a whole bunch, like three times Marcia, so that's eighteen!  Add 'em all up, and that's a lotta pets!

28 

"
"Corey's the oldest, then Amy, then Jackson, then little James.  James is 10, and Corey's a year older, so Corey's 11. Amy's younger than Corey by 2 years, so she's 9.  Amy's 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson's gotta be 4.

"
"Lee's fast, he runs that race in 38 seconds, but Gerald was slower by 2 seconds. So Gerald was at 40 seconds.  But Gerald got better at runnin', 10% better! That's like 4 seconds faster! So now Gerald runs it in 36 seconds.


36 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 60 dogs, and for every dog there's two kitties, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 kitties.  That's a lotta cats!  So that's 60 plus 120, which is 180 doggies and kitties all together.  Now they say the bunnies are 12 less than that, so that's 180 minus 12, which is 168 bunnies.  

Now, to get the total, we gotta add 'em all up: 168 bunnies plus 180 doggies and kitties, that's 348 pets in all!


348 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Two-fifths boys, so that's... a lotta boys.  That leaves a bunch of girls, right?  And most of them are in the scouts, I bet.  So, not all the girls are scouts, gotta be some left over.  

I'd say... maybe 40? 


40
"
"Harry slept a whole lotta hours, nine of 'em! James, he's a bit of a sleepyhead, only got six.  So Harry slept three more hours than James.


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... she made a whole lotta sauce, that's for sure!  If one can makes enough for half a jar, and she got a whole jar, she musta used two cans. And if each can has three tomatoes, that's six tomatoes in total. 


6 

"
"Well, lemme see... They started with 30 cars, and 5 snuck off. That leaves 25. Then 20 went through later, so 5 musta gone through first.


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... Mary got 18 new plants, right? And she already had 2 on each of her 40 window things. So that's 2 times 40, which is 80 plants.  Then she gives away one from each window, so that's 40 plants gone.  

80 plus 18 is 98, then take away 40... that's 58 plants left.


58 

"
"Well, lemme see... that first fella rang the doorbell a bunch, like twenty times! The second one rang it a few more times than that, I think it was like twenty-five. The third one, he was impatient, rang it a whole lot, like seventy times! And the last one, he rang it sixty times.  

So, if you add all those up... twenty plus twenty-five plus seventy plus sixty... that's a lotta ringin'!

175 



"
"Lemme see... he read some pages already, right?  So he gotta read, like, 39 pages in all.  He read 15, so that leaves him with 24 more.  He's got 4 days left, so that's 24 pages split into 4 days...  

6 pages a day. 


6
"
"Well, lemme see... he drinks four glasses a day, right?  That's like, Monday through Friday, so that's five days.  So that's four times five, which is twenty.  Then on the weekend he only drinks three a day, so that's six.  Twenty plus six...  

26 

"
"Well, lemme see... it takes 10 minutes for the fog to go 3 miles.  The whole city is 42 miles, so that's like... 14 sets of 3 miles.  So, it'd take 140 minutes, I reckon.

140 

"
"Well, Poppy put down a bunch of pieces, like a quarter of 'em.  That's a lot! Then her momma put down some more, like a third of what was left.  Hmm, gotta think...  If they put down a bunch, there's gotta be a bunch left over, right?  I'd say there's still a good chunk of the puzzle to do.

500 

"
"Cody eats a whole lotta cookies!  If Amir eats 5, and Cody eats three times that, he eats 15.  So that's 15 plus 5, which is 20 cookies all together.

20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Three boxes, huh?  So each one's like, 5 by 6 by 4, but the walls take up some space.  So, take away an inch from each side, right?  That leaves ya with 3 by 4 by 2.  

So that's 3 times 4 times 2, which is... 24.  

And since there's three boxes, it's 24 times 3...  

That's 72!


72 

"
"Well, lemme see... He watched two whole hours on Monday and Tuesday, right? And then another hour and a half on Thursday. Plus two more hours on Friday. That's like, five and a half hours already.  So that leaves him with one and a half hours for Wednesday.  

Each of them little shows is half an hour, so he musta watched three of 'em.


3 

"
"Well, lemme see... he had 110 cookies, but dropped 5, so that's 115. Then he made 15 extra, so that means he wanted to make 100. And since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, he musta made 50 last year. 


50
"
"Lemme see... so they buyin' ten gallons at three bucks a pop, that's thirty bucks right there.  But then they get twenty cents back for each gallon, so that's two bucks off.  So it's thirty minus two... that's twenty-eight bucks.


$28.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... Beatrice had a big ol' pile, like two across and twenty-four long, so that's a lotta roll-ups! Marcell had three across and fourteen long, so not as many.  If ya add 'em all up, it's a whole bunch.  Then ya split it in half 'cause there's two of 'em, and that's how many they ate on average.

45 

"
"Well, she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so that's like a foot every... lemme see...  carry the one...  about 0.8 seconds per foot.  

She rows for 64 seconds, so that's 64 divided by 0.8...  that's 80 feet.

Now, every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. So, 80 feet is like 8 sets of 10 feet, right?

So that's 8 times 2 liters...  that's 16 liters! 


16 

"
"Well, lemme see... they use that there whiteboard a whole bunch. Two times a day each, and they wipe it off three times each time they use it... so that's...  

24 

"
"Well, he plants 2 flowers every day, right? And he did that for 15 days, so that's 2 times 15... lemme see...  carry the 1... that's 30 flowers. But some didn't grow, 5 of 'em. So he's got 25 flowers now.


25 

"
"Well, Jamal's phone holds a whole lotta pictures, like, way more than Brittany's.  If his phone holds 1800, and that's six times more than hers, then hers only holds 300.  And that 300 is like, fifty times more ducks than in Jamal's picture. So, Jamal's got 6 ducks in his picture. 


6
"
"Well, lemme see... she bought them 2x4s for ten bucks a pop, and she's got ten of 'em, so that's a hundred bucks right there. Them 4x4s were sixteen bucks each, and she got five, so that's eighty bucks more.  So she spent a total of a hundred eighty bucks.

Now, lumber's gone up, so she can sell them 2x4s for fifteen bucks each, makin' a hundred fifty bucks. Them 4x4s, she can get twenty-four bucks each for 'em, so that's a hundred twenty bucks.

Altogether, she's makin' two hundred seventy bucks sellin' 'em.

So, she spent a hundred eighty and made two seventy... that's ninety bucks profit!


$90 

"
"Well, lemme see... she uses 7 spoonfuls of sugar for every 13 cups of water, right?  If she used 120 of them things in total,  I reckon she used 42 spoonfuls of sugar.

"
"Lemme see... he buys two shoes for each kid, and he got three kids, so that's six shoes.  If each shoe costs sixty bucks, then it's six times sixty...  

$360 

"
"Well, lemme see... They had 10 cars the first day, right?  So if they got 30 cars total, that means they got 20 more cars. And if each box has 5 cars, that's 4 more boxes.

"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, and that was 30% more than Lylah.  So Lylah made less, right?  

Let's see... if Adrien made 30% more, that means Lylah made 100% and Adrien made 130%.  

So Lylah made $40,000 divided by 1.3, which is about $30,769.

Now, Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so he made $40,000 plus 40% of $40,000, which is $16,000 more.

So Adrien made $56,000 four years later.

Lylah's salary went up by the same percentage, so she made 40% more than $30,769. That's $12,307 more.

So Lylah made $43,076 four years later.

Together, they made $56,000 plus $43,076, which is $99,076.



$99076.92 

"
"He uses a lotta paper, that's for sure! Two packs a week, and each pack has, like, thirty pieces in it?  So that's, uh... sixty pieces a week.  A month is four weeks, right? So that's... hmm...  carry the one...  two-forty pieces a month!

"
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, that's a lotta fruit! Kael brought double the apples, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 apples. And half the oranges, so 8 divided by 2 is 4 oranges.  

So, they got 5 plus 10 apples, that's 15 apples. And 8 plus 4 oranges, that's 12 oranges. All together, they got 15 plus 12, which is 27 fruits!

"
"Well, Sadie slept a whole lotta hours on Monday, eight of 'em! Then she had to do some school stuff, so she slept two less each night for the next two days. That's six hours each night, so that's twelve hours total. Then for the rest of the week, she got an extra hour of sleep each night, so that's seven hours a night.  There are four more nights, so that's twenty-eight more hours.  

Let's see... eight plus twelve plus twenty-eight... that's forty-eight hours!


48 

"
"Well, she runs real fast at first, 10 miles every hour for 3 hours. That's like, 30 miles already! Then she slows down, but still runs for 4 more hours.  If she's goin' 5 miles each hour, that's another 20 miles.  So, she runs 30 plus 20... that's 50 miles!


50 

"
"Well, she put stamps on 20 letters, right?  'Cause 60 divided by 3 is 20.  And now she's got 30 stamped letters, so she musta had 10 before.


10 

"
"Well, lemme see... she had 12 spoons at the end, and her hubby gave her 5.  So that's 12 minus 5... that's 7.  Then she used 3, so we gotta add them back... 7 plus 3 is 10.

10 

"
"He got 38 chicken ones and 6 more fishy ones, so that's 38 plus 6... lemme see... 44 fishy ones.  

So that's 38 plus 44...  

82 sausages!

"
"Amy made a whole lotta friends, like, way more than Lily. Lily made 50, and Amy made 20 more than that, so that's 70!  If you add them together, they got a bunch of friends, 120 in total!


120 

"
"Lemme see... so he buys four of them big watermelons, right?  Those things are pricey, like, three times what a pepper costs.  And peppers are fifteen bucks a pop! So the watermelons are forty-five bucks each.  That's, uh, 180 bucks for all four.

Then he gets twenty peppers, so that's 20 times 15, which is 300 bucks.

And the oranges, they're cheaper than the watermelons, like five bucks less. So they're forty bucks each. Ten oranges is 400 bucks.

Add it all up, 180 plus 300 plus 400... that's 880 bucks!


$880
"
"Well, lemme see... they see a whole lotta folks, 500 a day! And each one's there for, what was it, 24 minutes?  That's a lot of talkin' to doctors!

They pay the doctors a hundred and fifty bucks an hour, right?  And they charge folks 200 bucks an hour.  So, they're makin' 50 bucks extra for every hour, I guess.

Hmm, gotta figure out how many hours that is... 500 people times 24 minutes...  carry the one... that's a lotta minutes!  Gotta turn that into hours...

Let's just say they make a good chunk of change, that's for sure!


$10,000 

"
"Well, lemme see... she starts with 60 elves, right?  Then a bunch quit 'cause kids were bein' nasty.  That's gotta be like, 20 elves, maybe?  So that leaves her with 40. Then more quit 'cause they got kicked.  That's another 10 gone.  So, she's got... 30 elves left.


30 

"
"Well, lemme see... He spent 500 bucks in May, and then 60 less in June, so that's... hmm... 440 bucks.  

So, all together, that's 500 plus 440...  

That's 940 dollars.


$940

"Let's see... Pam rode the big ride twice, so that's 2 times 6 tickets... hmm, that's 12 tickets. Fred rode it 4 times, so that's 4 times 6...  carry the one... that's 24 tickets.  They both rode the slide thing twice, so that's another 12 for each of them.  

So, 12 plus 24 plus 12 plus 12...  

*counts on fingers*

That's 60 tickets! 


60
"
"Well, lemme see... He walked 4 miles on Monday, and then 6 times that on Tuesday, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 miles.  That's a lot of walkin'!  So Monday and Tuesday he did 4 plus 24, which is 28 miles.  If he walked 41 miles total, then Wednesday musta been 41 minus 28, which is 13 miles.


13 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 4 washes a month, and each one costs 15 bucks, so that's 4 times 15...  carry the one...  that's 60 bucks a month.  Now, there's 12 months in a year, so 60 times 12...  

720 

"
"Brian had 20 games but lost some, so he has 15 now. Bobby has three times that many, but 5 less.  So, lemme see... three times 15 is 45, and then take away 5... that's 40!

40 

"
"Well, lemme see...  There's them 27 unicorns, right?  And a third of 'em are up in Scotland. So that's 9 unicorns.  Now, two outta every three of them Scottish ones are girls.  So that's gotta be... 6, I think. 


6 

"
"Lemme see... two subs at seven-fifty each... that's fifteen bucks. Chips are a dollar-fifty each, so two of them is three bucks. Cookies are a dollar, so two is two bucks.  So that's fifteen plus three plus two... twenty bucks for the food.  Delivery is twenty percent, so that's... uh... four bucks more.  Then she wants to tip five bucks.  So twenty plus four plus five... that's twenty-nine dollars!


$29.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... he did 5 questions every hour, right? So on the first test, he did 5 times 8, which is 40 questions. That means he missed 35 on that one.  Then on the second test, he did 5 times 6, so 30 questions. He missed a whole lotta those, 70 of 'em!  

Add those together, and that's 105 questions he didn't finish.


105 

"
"Lemme see... you got 12 blue ones, right?  And there's a whole bunch more pink ones.  It's like, four times the blue ones plus some extra.  So, four times 12 is... lemme count... 48!  And then you gotta add 22 more...  

48 plus 22 is 70!

70 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 20 cars in total, 12 are them fancy automatic ones, and 4 are stick shift.  That leaves 4 cars that must be the in-between ones. So, 4 outta 20... that's gotta be 20%, right?


20 

"
"Well, lemme see... there's a whole bunch of bees, right?  

They said there's twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queen bees.  So, if there's a queen bee, there's gotta be two baby bees, and then four worker bees.

That's seven bees right there.  

Now, if we keep doin' that over and over, we gotta figure out how many times seven goes into 700.  Hmm... that's a lot of dividin'.

Let's see... 700 divided by 7...  that's a hundred!

So there's a hundred groups of seven bees.

That means there's 400 worker bees.

400 

"
"Well, if he plays games for two hours a day and makes ten bucks an hour workin', that's twenty bucks a day, right?  So in a whole week, that's like... twenty times seven... hmm... lemme see...  

140 

"
"Lemme see... milk and eggs is 2 plus 3, that's 5 bucks.  The other stuff is 3 plus 3 plus 4, so that's 10 bucks.  But wait, the light bulbs and cups and traps, they got that extra tax thingy...  That's like, 10% of 10 bucks, which is... uh... a dollar! So the traps and stuff are 11 bucks.  

All together, that's 5 plus 11, so it's 16 bucks.


$16 

"
"Okay, so he's got 3 folks already, and 5 more comin' in. That's 8 houses to clean.  Each one needs 2 bottles of that bleach stuff, which is $2 a pop. So that's 8 times 2 times $2, which is $32. Then he needs cloths, $5 a pack, and he needs one for each house. So that's 8 times $5, which is $40.  

He makes $92 cleanin' all those houses. So, $92 minus $32 for bleach and $40 for cloths... that's $20 profit.

$20 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got 10 of them fields, and each one has a hundred pineapples. So that's 10 times 100, which is... a thousand pineapples! And he gets to pick 'em every three months, right?  So in a whole year, that's like... four times.  So he gets a thousand pineapples four times... that's a lot of pineapples!  

4000 

"
"Gosh, that's a lotta Legos!  Let's see... he's got 500, then another one with, like, three times that... so that's 500 times 3...  carry the one... that's 1500! And then a little one with, uh, a quarter of the first one... so that's 500 divided by 4... hmm... that's 125.

So, all together, it's 500 plus 1500 plus 125...  

2125!  That's a whole lotta pickin' up!


2125
"
"Well, lemme see... she saw 30 bees fly out, then 15 come back. Then a whole bunch more flew out, double the first time, so that's 60 more.  That's a lot of bees!  So all them bees gotta come back sometime, right? So that's 30 plus 60, which is 90 bees comin' back home.


90 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got one big person ticket for 12 bucks and one little person ticket for 10 bucks. That's 22 bucks all together.  They got 8 bucks back, so they musta given the man 30 bucks.


$30 

"
"Well, Charlie's got a lotta friends, 12 of 'em!  Dorothy's got way less, like a third of that.  So, that's 4 for Dorothy.  Now, James, he's got a ton more than Dorothy, like four times as much.  So, James has gotta have... lemme see... 4 times 4... that's 16 friends!


16 

"
"Well, lemme see... Steve's got a ways to go, three whole miles! Tim's closer, just two.  Steve's on a bike though, so he's gonna be faster.  Hmm, I dunno 'bout all that feet per minute stuff, but I bet Steve gets there first.  Probably by a few minutes, maybe four?


4 

"
"Lemme see... she charged 25 cents per tire, right?  So bikes got two tires, that's 50 cents each.  She did 5 bikes, so that's 2 bucks fifty. Trikes got three tires, so that's 75 cents each, and she did 3 of them, so that's 2 bucks and 25 cents. And the unicycle, that's just a quarter.

So, 2.50 plus 2.25 plus 0.25... that's 5 bucks!


$5.00 

"
"Lemme see... ten packs of cookies, six in each... that's a lotta cookies!  So that's sixty cookies times ten cents each... hmm... carry the one... that's six bucks.  He gave the man a ten dollar bill, so he gets four dollars back.


$4.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... that seagull was a real jerk!  Dave had some fries, then the bird took some, then some pigeons came along and ate some more.  Then that raccoon got in on the action!  

In the end, there were only 5 fries left.  

So, if you work backwards, there musta been 9 fries to start with.

"
"Well, lemme see... he got class three times a day on some days and two times on others.  That's a lotta schoolin'!  If he's got class for a whole hour each time, that's gotta be a lot of hours.  Hmm... sixteen weeks is a long time too.  

Let's see...

"
"Lemme see... he bakes a whole lotta stuff!  Three hundred of them little rolls, a bunch of them fancy croissants, and sixty of them long bread sticks.  

Those rolls are small, like four inches each. The croissants are bigger, six inches. And them baguettes, they're two feet long, that's like, twenty-four inches!

So, gotta add up all them inches...  

That's a lot of addin'!  But if you do it right, it comes out to 280 feet.

"Lemme see... them monkeys eat a lotta bananas!  They need 200, the big gorillas need 400, and them baboons, they eat 100.  So that's 700 bananas every month.  

Now, he needs enough for two months, so that's double, right? 700 times 2 is... 1400 bananas!

"Well, Blake ran back and forth a bunch of times, so that's gotta be a lot. Kelly only did it once, then ran to that 40-yard line a whole lotta times.  I bet Kelly ran way farther.  

Let's see... 15 times back and forth is like... a lot of yards.  But Kelly did that 40-yard thing a ton of times.  I'd say Kelly wins by a bunch!

**Answer:** 1320 



"
"Lemme see... he bought four of them pens at a dollar fifty each... so that's six bucks. Two notebooks at four bucks a pop... that's eight. And the paper was twenty.  

Six plus eight plus twenty...  that's thirty-four dollars.


34 

"
"Well, he started with 11 little fellas. Then a bunch more popped up, so that's more'n 11.  Then some went hidin', so it's less'n all the ones that popped up.  Gotta be... 15! 


15
"
"Well, lemme see...  They added 7 feet on Tuesday, so that's 17 plus 7, which is 24 feet.  Then on Wednesday, it was two-thirds of that...  Hmm, two-thirds of 24...  That's gotta be 16 feet.

"
"Anakin got a whole bunch of fishies! Ten star fishies, six horsey fishies, and three funny fishies. Locsin, he got less star fishies, like five, and less horsey fishies, only three. But he got more funny fishies, five of them!  

Hmm, let's see... Anakin got 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fishies. Locsin got 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fishies.

Altogether, they got 19 + 13 = 32 fishies!


32 

"
"Well, lemme see... that's a lotta months!  If it goes up by $4 every two months, and it's 36 months... that's like 18 times it goes up. So, $4 times 18 is... uh... carry the one...  $72!  

So, $20 plus $72... that's $92! 


$92
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Five cars at four bucks a pop... that's twenty bucks.  Those action figures are five bucks each, so three of them is fifteen. And the doll costs the same as the three figures, so that's another fifteen.  

Add it all up... twenty plus fifteen plus fifteen... that's fifty bucks!

"
"Well, if she loses 3 hours of work makin' $35 an hour, that's $105 she's missin' out on.  The fella wants $90 to do 'em.  So, she'd have $15 more if she just paid the guy.


$15 

"
"Let's see... she got a computer for a thousand and ninety euros, right? And then some other stuff... a scanner thingy, a burner, and a printer... that's, uh, three hundred and thirty-three euros more. So all together, that's fourteen twenty-three euros.  She had fifteen hundred, so... she got seventy-seven euros left for clothes! 


€77 

"
"Well, lemme see... she needs 15 of them flan things, and each one takes 3 eggs. So that's 15 times 3...  carry the one... that's 45 eggs she needs.

Now, her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she watches the little one. So, 45 divided by 9... hmm... that's 5 times.

"
"Well, lemme see... Seth's twice as old as Brooke, right? And in two years, they'll be 28 together.  Hmm... if we add two years to each of 'em, that's like addin' four to the total. So, they're 24 now. If Seth's twice Brooke's age, that means Brooke's gotta be 8, and Seth's gotta be 16.

16 

"
"Ethel's got 8 bucks, right? Jimmy's got double that, so that's 16.  But wait, he's got 2 more on top of that... so Jimmy's got 18 bucks.


$18
"
"Well, lemme see... He walks 20 miles each day, but on the weekend he only does 10. So that's like, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, then 10, 10.  

Let's see... 20 plus 20 plus 20 plus 20 plus 20 is 100. Then add the 10 and 10, that's 20 more.

So 100 plus 20 is... 120!


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the hat's 25 bucks, right? And the jacket's like, three of them hats, so that's 75.  Then the pants, they're in the middle, so that's gotta be 50.

I think it's 1210 legs! 


1210
"
"Well, lemme see... Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so that's 8 too. Granny Red is double Sally Four, so she's 8 times 2, which is 16. And Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 plus 3, makin' her 19.  

Now, to get the total, we add 'em all up: 8 plus 8 plus 16 plus 19... that's 51!


51 

"
"Okay, so she gotta pay 300 for the school thing, 200 for the card thingy, and 500 for the house, right? That's 1000 bucks a month already.  But she wants to pay extra, like half again more. So that's another 500 bucks.  So every month it's 1500 bucks.

Now, there's 12 months in a year, so 1500 times 12 is... lemme see...  carry the one... 18,000!

$18000 



"
"Gosh, that's a lotta potatoes!  Let's see... a minute and a half for each one to peel, so that's 90 minutes right there. Then cuttin' 'em up is quick, maybe 5 seconds each, so that's another 5 minutes.  

95 

"
"Lemonade, huh?  Let's see... they made 5 bucks profit on each jug, and they made 25 bucks total. So that's 25 divided by 5, which is 5 jugs.

Lemons cost 3 bucks a jug, so 5 jugs times 3 bucks is... 15 bucks!


$15 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa folks runnin'!  They say 160 of 'em are Chinese, and 60 of them boys.  That means the rest gotta be girls, right? So, 160 minus 60... that's 100 girls.

"
"Okay, so Zaid makes six thousand bucks a month. He spends a quarter of that on his place, which is fifteen hundred. Then he spends another two thousand on gas for his car. That's already three thousand five hundred gone.

He gives half of what's left to charity, so that's another twelve fifty. Now he's down to two thousand two hundred and fifty.

He gives his daughter two hundred and his wife seven hundred, so that's nine hundred total.

That leaves him with... lemme see... two thousand two hundred and fifty minus nine hundred...  

**$1350** 



"
"Bo's got a whole lotta crabs, forty! Monic's got less, like, four less than Bo, so that's thirty-six. Rani's got even more than Monic, ten more, so she's got forty-six.  If you add 'em all up, that's a lotta crabs! Forty plus thirty-six plus forty-six... hmm... carry the one... that's one hundred and twenty-two crabs!


122 

"
"Lemme see... he makes ten bucks an hour, right?  So first week he made 5 times 10, which is 50 bucks. Second week, 8 times 10 is 80 bucks.  So all together, that's 50 plus 80...  

$130 

"
"Well, if three-quarters of the class voted for the winner, that means one-quarter voted for the other fella.  So, you gotta take 80 and divide it by 4, that's 20.

"
"That flower lady, Sandra, she's always orderin' a whole bunch of stuff.  She got them fancy pink lilies, like a hundred of 'em, maybe more.  And she wanted four times as many red roses as those white flowers she likes.  I dunno, maybe she's makin' a big bouquet for someone special.  Anyway, she wants them red roses by five or she's gonna go to another flower guy.  Gotta get her those roses, or she'll be mad!

**160** 

"
"Well, lemme see... Jan's 30 now, so two years ago she was 28.  Mark was 5 years older than half of that, so he was... hmm... half of 28 is 14, and 5 more than that is 19.  So Mark was 19 two years ago. That means he's 21 now.  Jean's two years older than Mark, so she's gotta be 23.


23
"
"Well, that first team, they're all pretty fast, right?  Each one does it in 55 seconds. So that's like, 55 plus 55 plus 55 plus 55...  that's 220 seconds.

The other team, they're a bit slower. The first guy takes 60 seconds, then the next one's a bit quicker, and so on.  Hmm, lemme see... 60 plus... uh... 57... then 54... and then 51.  That's 222 seconds.

So the first team wins by... 2 seconds! 


2
"
"Well, if you roll a die, there's three numbers bigger than 3, right?  So that's like half the time you'll get one of them.  

Rollin' two evens in a row, that's trickier.  Half the time you get an even, then you gotta get another even.  That's gotta be less likely, right?  

I'd say it's way more likely to get a number bigger than 3.  Maybe like, 25% more likely?


25 

"
"Well, if her momma got 20 apples, and Jenna got half, that's like 10 apples for Jenna.  So, all together they got 20 plus 10, which is 30 apples.


30 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 160 pieces of straw, and them hamsters took 50, and them bunnies took 20.  That leaves 90 pieces for the rats. If each rat gets 6 pieces, that's 15 rats.  And they're split up in 3 cages, so there's gotta be 5 rats in each cage.


5 

"
"Lemme see... so she owes a hundred bucks, right? And every month it goes up by 2 bucks, 'cause of that interest thingy. So after one month, it's 102. Then another 2 bucks the next month, so 104. And then another 2 bucks, makin' it 106. 

$106.12 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he buys the wheat for 20 bucks a bag, then pays 2 more to move it. So that's 22 bucks he's already spent on each bag. He sells 'em for 30 bucks a pop, so he makes 8 bucks profit on each one. If he made 400 bucks total, that means he sold 50 bags. 


50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they spent 20 bucks on tickets, then 4 bucks less on grub, so that's 16 bucks.  Rides cost 33 each, so that's 66 bucks for both.  All together, that's 20 plus 16 plus 66, which is 102 bucks.  Split between three friends, that's 34 bucks each.

"Well, lemme see... he picks peaches for three whole hours, and that's a lotta time!  If he gets two peaches every minute, and there's sixty minutes in an hour...  carry the one...  that's a whole heap of peaches!

"Well, lemme see... them ducks gotta eat a whole lotta bugs, huh?  3.5 pounds each, that's a lot!  So ten ducks, that's 35 pounds of bugs for the whole bunch every week.  Now, there's seven days in a week, so that's...  carry the one...  5 pounds a day!

5 

"
"Well, lemme see... he plants ten a year, but cuts down two, so that's eight more each year.  He starts with fifty, so after ten years that's eighty more trees.  That's a hundred and thirty trees! But then some die, thirty percent...  Hmm, that's like, thirty outta a hundred, so...  about thirty trees die.  So he's got... ninety-one left? I think?


91 

"
"Well, lemme see... They started with 18 pink ones, took away 6, so that's 12 left. Then they put more pink ones out, so that's a whole bunch more pink than white.  Gotta be at least 20 more pink ones, I reckon.


24 

"
"Lemme see... she got 20 bucks and each crayon is 2 bucks.  She wants 5 crayons so that's 5 times 2... which is 10 bucks.  So she gets 10 bucks back.


$10 

"
"A pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.  A pencil is a buck twenty, and an eraser is thirty cents. So a pen is a dollar fifty. Eight pens would be... lemme see...  carry the one... that's twelve dollars.

"
"Well, if they's givin' out 2 pounds to each place, and there's 40 places, that's 80 pounds they's usin'.

Let's see... 23786 minus them grown-ups...  

6277 kids! 



"
"Lemme see... she started with 20, then got three times that, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60.  Then she got 20 less the next month, so that's 60 minus 20, which is 40.  Then she doubled what she got in the first two months, so that's 60 plus 40, which is 100, times 2, which is 200.  So she got 20 plus 60 plus 40 plus 200, which is... 320 cards!


320
"
"Well, lemme see... he does 500 for one guy and 500 for the other, right?  That first fella pays him a nickel a pop, so that's 25 bucks. The other guy pays double, so that's a dime a sentence.  So that's 50 bucks.  25 plus 50 is 75 bucks.  

7500 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... He gets 5 buckets in the mornin' and 6 in the evenin', right?  That's 11 buckets all together. And each bucket has 5 of them liters... so that's 11 times 5...  

55 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets an extra 5000 bucks right off the bat, that's for sure. And then his pay goes up by 5%, so that's like... a hundred bucks more each week.  So he's makin' 2100 a week now. Times that by 52 weeks in a year... that's a lotta money!  

Hold on, lemme grab my calculator...

*scribbling on a napkin*

Okay, so that's 109,200 from his regular pay, plus the 5000 bonus... that makes it 114,200 bucks for the whole year!


$114,200 

"
"Well, she's got ten acres, and each one gives ya five big piles of grapes, right? So that's fifty piles in total. And each pile makes two barrels of that fancy wine stuff.  So, lemme see... fifty piles times two barrels each... that's a hundred barrels!

"
"Lemme see... he eats two slices on his sandwich every day, and that's seven days a week, so that's fourteen slices right there. Then he has them omelet things a few times, and he uses three slices for those.  And don't forget the big ol' macaroni dish, that's eight slices.  

So, fourteen plus nine plus eight...  carry the one... that's thirty-one slices!

"
"Janet had a bunch of pens, then got more.  Let's see... she had 22 green ones and 10 yellow ones. That's 32 pens already. Then she got 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens. So that's 6 times 9, which is 54 blue pens!  And she got 2 bags of red pens with 6 in each bag, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 red pens.

Now we gotta add 'em all up: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens!


98 

"
"Well, shoot, that's a tough one!  Let's see... she wants a 93 average, right? And she's got five scores already.  If she wants a 93 average on six tests, she needs a whole lotta points!  

Hmm... lemme add up those scores she got already... 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86... that's 438 points.

Now, 93 times 6 is 558.  So she needs 558 points total.

She needs to get 120 points on that last test! 


**Answer:** 120 

"
"Well, lemme see... He rode 25 clicks five times a week, so that's 25 times 5, which is 125 clicks a week. He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 times 4, which is 500 clicks. Then he rode 60 clicks twice a week, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 clicks a week. He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 times 3, which is 360 clicks. Now we gotta add those together, 500 plus 360... that's 860 clicks!


860 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he's got a bunch of chocolate bars, right? And those apple things.  If each chocolate bar is like, double the weight of an apple, and a chocolate bar is 40 grams, then an apple is 20 grams.  

So, 25 chocolate bars is 25 times 40, which is 1000 grams. And 80 apples is 80 times 20, which is 1600 grams.

Add those together, and you get 2600 grams.

2600 

"
"Well, lemme see... she got 4 cakes on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she got, like, three times that, so that's 12 more. And then on Wednesday, she got a whole bunch more, five times what she got on Tuesday... so that's 60!  

So, all together, she got 4 plus 12 plus 60... that's 76 cakes!

"
"Lemme see... so they got these plates, right?  Cost a whole lotta money, six thousand bucks for just half a dozen!  And the cups, they're cheaper, like a thousand two hundred less than those plates.  

So, twenty dozen cups... that's a lot of cups!  Gotta be, what, two hundred and forty cups?  

Hmm... if the plates cost three thousand and the cups are cheaper by twelve hundred... that means the cups cost eighteen hundred bucks.

So, eighteen hundred bucks for two hundred and forty cups...  That's... lemme see...  

Seven fifty a cup! 


$7.50
"
"Okay, so she needs a jacket for 30 bucks and two pairs of shoes, which is 20 bucks a pop, so that's 40 bucks for the shoes.  That's 70 bucks total.

She already has 10 bucks, and made 20 bucks babysittin', so that's 30 bucks.

She needs 40 more bucks.  If she gets 4 bucks each time she mows, she gotta mow 10 times.


**Answer:** 10

"Well, lemme see...  He gets 42 eggs every day, right? And the white chickens lay more eggs than the red ones.  If he has more white chickens, I bet he's got 4 red chickens.

"That park's a right good size, ain't it?  Let's see... he walks all the way around, so that's like goin' down one side, then the other, then back up the other two.  

If it's 1.5 miles one way and 6 the other, that's 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 6 plus 6...  carry the one... that's 15 miles total.

He walks 3 miles every hour, so it'll take him 5 hours to do the whole thing.

"
"Well, she counted a hundred the first day, then fifty more the next, so that's a hundred and fifty.  That's two hundred and fifty people in two days.  So, she musta seen two hundred and fifty folks on the third day to get to five hundred.

"
"Well, lemme see...  If the big pool had twice as much water before, and now it has four times as much, that means it lost some water, right? And the little pool lost some too.  

Since they both leak at the same rate, the little pool musta had 8 gallons in it before.  

8 

"
"Lemme see... she needs 320 bucks for the shoes and another 32 for the belt, so that's 352 dollars total.  If she makes 8 bucks an hour, she gotta work 44 hours.

"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed some money, right?  She gotta pay back the money plus extra, like a little thank you.  She's payin' a bit each month.  

Let's see... she borrowed two thousand, and she gotta pay ten percent more. That's like... two hundred extra bucks. So she owes two thousand two hundred in total.

If she pays one sixty-five every month for a whole year, that's twelve months, right?  So that's one sixty-five times twelve... lemme grab my calculator... that's nineteen eighty.

So she paid nineteen eighty, but she owed two thousand two hundred.  Two thousand two hundred minus nineteen eighty...  

Hmm, that's two hundred and twenty bucks left over.


220 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Four roses... and seven more of them fancy dahlias... that's a lotta flowers!  So, four plus seven... that's eleven dahlias.  Then you gotta add the roses... four plus eleven... that's fifteen!

"
"Well, lemme see... Harriet's 21 now, right? And Adrian's three times older, so he's gotta be 63. Zack's twice Harriet's age, so he's 42.

In three years, they'll all be older. Harriet'll be 24, Adrian'll be 66, and Zack'll be 45.

Add those up, that's 135.  Divide that by three, 'cause there's three of 'em, and you get 45.


45 

"
"Let's see... they got 251 points all together. Naomi got 68, Yuri got 10 more than half of what Naomi got, and Brianna got 17 more than Naomi.  So, Yuri got 68 divided by 2, which is 34, plus 10 more, so that's 44. Brianna got 68 plus 17, so that's 85.  

Now, let's add up what Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna got: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.

That means Jojo got 251 minus 197, which is 54 points.


54 

"
"Lemme see... she does three of them crossword thingies at 10 minutes a pop, so that's 30 minutes. Then she does 8 of them sudoku thingies at 5 minutes each, so that's 40 minutes.

"
"Hmm, let me see... She had 120 buckets of water, used 90, so that leaves 30. Then she got 60 more from the rain.  So, 30 plus 60... that's 90 buckets!


90 

"
"Hmm, let's see... He plants 90 of them red ones, and 40 less of the other kind... so that's 50 of the other ones.  

90 plus 50... that's 140 flowers all together.


140 

"
"Well, lemme see... they spent fifteen thousand the first year, right? And then a third of that the next year... so that's like, fifteen thousand divided by three... hmm... lemme grab my calculator...  

That's five thousand! So, they spent five thousand the second year. Now, we gotta add that to the first year's spendin'... fifteen thousand plus five thousand...

That's twenty thousand dollars!


$20000 

"
"Lemme see... Carlos paid 30 bucks an hour for his boat, and he had it for 3 hours, so that's 30 times 3... which is 90 bucks. Benji's thing was cheaper, 18 bucks an hour, and he had it for 5 hours, so that's 18 times 5... which is also 90 bucks!  

So, all together they spent 90 plus 90... that's 180 bucks!


180 

"
"Well, if it takes 6 days on the bus, and the car's faster, it'd be like, half that time, right? So 3 days in the car.  That's 6 plus 3... 9 days all together.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he's got a bunch of them water cards, right?  He loses some, but then gets more grass ones.  

Let's see... 32 water cards outta 96 total... that's gotta be, like, a third of 'em, right? So, about 33%? 


33
"
"Lemme see... burrito is six-fifty.  Meat's two bucks, cheese is a dollar, avocado's a dollar too. Sauces are a quarter each, so that's fifty cents.  Upgrading the meal is three dollars more.

But he's got a five dollar gift card, so... fourteen minus five... that's nine dollars.

Then there's that ten percent tax thingy.  Ten percent of two hundred forty thousand... hmm...  that's twenty-four thousand dollars more.

So now it's two hundred sixty-four thousand.  But wait, there's more! He gotta pay a thousand bucks to register each car.  Twelve cars times a thousand bucks... that's another twelve thousand.

So, all together, it's two hundred sixty-four thousand plus twelve thousand...

"Well, he eats 6 a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, so that's 3.  That's 9 tomatoes a day all together.  A week is 7 days, so that's 9 times 7, which is 63 tomatoes.  If each vine gives 3 tomatoes a week, he needs 63 divided by 3, which is 21 vines.

"Well, lemme see... 20 friends wantin' 4 slices each... that's a lotta pizza!  Each pizza has 8 slices, so... hmm...  

Let's see... 20 times 4 is 80... so he needs 10 pizzas.

"
"Well, lemme see... He buys 25 pens, right? And he can make one new pen outta five empties. So, that's like... 25 pens divided by 5...  that's 5 more pens!

So he gets 25 plus 5, which is 30 pens! 


30 

"
"Well, he had 20 bucks, then got 10 more, so that's 30 bucks.  If it tripled, that's like 3 times 30... lemme see... 30, 60, 90!

"Joan's gotta be older 'cause she's the tallest.  Jessa's 20, and Joan's 5 years older, so she's 25. Mary's younger than Joan, so she's gotta be 23.  

If you add 'em all up, that's 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... So a thousand kids were in the hall, right?  And 300 of 'em went out door A. That leaves 700 left. Then, most of them, like, 420, went out door B. So the rest, 280, musta gone out door C.

"John's got a whole lotta candy, 54!  James only has a few more than that fella Robert, who don't have much.  Let's see... if John has double Robert, Robert's got half of John's, so that's 54 split in two... 27 for Robert.  James has 6 more than Robert, so he's got 27 plus 6... that's 33.  

John's got 54 and James has 33, so John's got 21 more candies.

"Dolly got two books, and Pandora got one. They share, so they both read all three books.

"Well, lemme see... he had 5 friends he wrote to, but stopped talkin' to 2. So that's 3 left. They each send 2 letters a week, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 letters comin' in. He writes 6 back too, so that's 12 letters total. Each letter's 5 pages long, so that's 12 times 5, which is 60 pages.

He writes a page every 6 minutes, so 60 pages takes him 60 times 6, which is 360 minutes.  There's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 360 divided by 60, which is 6 hours.

"
"Well, lemme see... He talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes, so that's 15 times 30, which is... uh... 450 minutes.  And he used another 300 minutes talkin' to other folks. So that's 450 plus 300... that's 750 minutes gone.

He started with 1000 minutes, so he's got 1000 minus 750...  carry the one... that's 250 minutes left.

"Lemme see... Griffin had some fries, then some fellas took some.  Kyle took 5, and Billy took, like, double that, so that's 10.  That's 15 fries gone already.  Griffin had 9 left. Then Colby took some, but less than Kyle, so maybe 2?  That leaves Griffin with 7 fries.  But he ended up with 27, so Ginger musta given him a whole bunch!  That's gotta be 20 fries!


**Answer:** 20 

"
"Well, lemme see... there's a bunch more snails in one tank than the other, right?  They say that difference is like havin' twice as many fish in both tanks put together.  So if we take that difference and cut it in half, that's gotta be how many fish are in each tank.  

28 fish, split in half, is... 14!

"Wow, that's a lotta makeup!  

So, she pays $250 every hour, and it takes 6 hours each day, right? That's $250 times 6, which is $1500 a day.

And she needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 times 4, which is $6000 a week.

The movie takes 5 weeks, so it's $6000 times 5, which is $30,000.

But then the makeup lady gives her a discount, 10% off, so that's $3000 off.

So, in the end, Jean pays $30,000 minus $3000, which is $27,000.

$27000

"Lemme see... she spent 12 bucks on the cake thingy, 43 on presents, 15 on makin' the place look pretty, 4 on those invite thingies, and 22 on the goodie bags.  That's a lotta stuff!

So, that's 12 plus 43 plus 15 plus 4 plus 22...  carry the one... that's 96 dollars all together.

Now, she split it three ways with her momma and daddy, so that's 96 divided by 3... hmm... 32 dollars each!

"Well, lemme see... Sue ate a whole lotta cookies!  On Monday, she had four times more than her sister, who only had five. So Sue had 4 times 5, which is 20 cookies.  Then on Tuesday, Sue had double what her sister had, and her sister had 13. So Sue had 2 times 13, which is 26 cookies.

Now, each cookie has 200 calories, right? So we gotta multiply all those cookies by 200.  

Sue ate 20 + 26 cookies, which is 46 cookies total.  That's 46 times 200 calories, which is... lemme grab my calculator... 9200 calories!

Her sister ate 5 + 13 cookies, which is 18 cookies. That's 18 times 200 calories, which is 3600 calories.

So Sue ate 9200 - 3600 calories more than her sister. That's a lot of extra calories!

"Well, lemme see...  There's 20 kids in each class, right? And three classes, so that's 60 kids total. Half boys, half girls, so 30 of each.  The first two classes got a lotta girls, 15 and 12, that's 27.  So the last class only has 3 girls. That means there's gotta be 17 boys in the last class.

"Hmm, lemme see... He had 61, took off 9... that's like 52 left. Then he got 18 more... so 52 plus 18...

"Dang, that Rick sure is a good hunter!  Let's see... he got 10 wolves and 15 of them cougar things yesterday. Today he got a whole bunch more wolves, like three times as many as them cougars. And he got three less cougars than yesterday.

"
"Well, lemme see...  He starts with a whole lotta cows, right? Then he gets more.  So, if he puts the new ones in all the stalls, each stall gets a few more cows.  

If you got 8 stalls, that's a good chunk of 'em.  Gotta be a lot of cows there!

"
"Lemme see... he's got a hundred pennies, that's a dollar right there. Then he's got forty nickels, those are worth five cents each, so that's two dollars.  And twenty dimes, those are ten cents each, so that's two more dollars. And forty dollar bills... well, that's forty dollars!  

So, a dollar plus two plus two plus forty... that's forty-five dollars!

"Well, that's a mighty big tree!  If each part weighs 400 pounds, and it's 200 feet tall, that's a lotta parts!  

Let's see... 200 feet divided by 10 feet per part is 20 parts. So it weighed 20 times 400, which is 8000 pounds!

But them termites got to it, huh?  Took 30% of it.  That's a lot of wood gone!

Hmm, 30% of 8000...  That's like, 2400 pounds gone.

So now it weighs 8000 minus 2400... which is 5600 pounds.

Now, let's add 'em all up... Andrea's got 52 apples plus 24 bananas, that's 76. Jamal's got 44 apples plus 48 bananas, that's 92.  

Altogether, they got 76 plus 92, which is 168 fruits.

"Well, lemme see... she's makin' a whole lotta cookies!  Two cups for a dozen, and she's doin' 36 today and 30 tomorrow... that's a lot of countin'!  

Let's see... 36 plus 30... that's 66 cookies.  Hmm...  

66 cookies...  that's like... more than five dozens, right?  So, she'll need more than 10 cups of flour, that's for sure.  

I'd say she needs 'bout 11 cups, maybe a little more.

"Hmm, lemme see...  So you got a whole bunch of pennies, right?  Nine thousand, three hundred.  And you wanna know how much two-thirds of 'em is in dollars?

"Carmen's got a hundred bucks. Samantha's got more than her, like twenty-five bucks more. So Samantha's got a hundred and twenty-five. Daisy's got even more, fifty bucks more than Samantha.  So Daisy's got, lemme see, a hundred and twenty-five plus fifty... that's a hundred and seventy-five!

Now, to get the total, we gotta add 'em all up: a hundred plus a hundred and twenty-five plus a hundred and seventy-five...  

That's four hundred dollars!

"That's a lotta numbers!  Let's see... the house is 350,000, right? And then there's that extra stuff, 5% and 12%...  

*fumbles with a calculator*

Okay, so 5% of 350,000 is 17,500. And 12% is... 42,000.  

So that's 17,500 plus 42,000...  that's 59,500 more on top of the 350,000.

So the house is 409,500.  But she only has 400,000.

Hmm... 409,500 minus 400,000...  that's 9,500 more than she can spend.

"Hmm, lemme see... so he sold his house for four hundred thousand, right?  But then he had to pay some fees, like three percent for somethin' called transfer and five percent for a broker guy.  That's a lot of percentages!  And then he had to pay off the rest of the loan, two hundred and fifty thousand.  

So, four hundred thousand minus the fees and the loan...  That's gotta be...  one hundred and eighteen thousand!


$118,000

"Well, lemme see... it takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees, and then it takes longer to get to 400, right?  They said 40% longer, so that's like... a little less than half again, I guess? So maybe another 8 minutes?  

So that's 28 minutes to get hot. Then it takes 5 minutes less to cook than it did to heat up, so that's 23 minutes.

All together, that's 28 plus 23, which is 51 minutes.

Altogether, that's 900 plus 90 plus 180, which is 1170 stitches.

That means the two sleeves gotta be the rest, right? So 1800 minus 1170 is 630 stitches. And since there's two sleeves, each one takes 315 stitches.

The second scene is 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 plus 6, which is 60. And he says most of those, like 4 out of every 5. So that's 60 times 4, divided by 5... that's 48 lines.

Now we gotta add 'em all up: 54 plus 36 plus 48...  that's 138 lines!

So, that's 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

Altogether, they wrote 240 + 120 = 360 stories.

So, she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

"Well, lemme see... three folks eat three eggs each, so that's nine eggs right there. Then there's two more folks eatin' two eggs each, so that's four more.  Add 'em up, nine plus four, that's thirteen eggs every day.  Now, there's seven days in a week, so thirteen times seven... hmm... carry the one... that's ninety-one eggs!

"Quinn's 30, Jane's a few years younger, like 3 I think. So Jane's 27.  Trent's older than Jane by 5 years, so he's gotta be 32.

"
"Well, Cera's 46 now, so six years ago she was 40.  That little Noah fella was half her age then, so he was 20.  They said Chile had 3000 times Noah's age back then, so that's 3000 times 20... lemme see...  carry the one... that's 60,000 people!  But that was six years ago, and they said it's doubled since then. So now it's gotta be... 60,000 times 2...  

120000 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got a whole lotta fellas on that team.  Twice as many on offense as defense, huh? And half as many on special teams as defense.  

If we got 105 guys total, and I'm guessin' defense is a good chunk of that, maybe... 30 on defense? That sounds about right.

"
"Let's see... Martha had a bunch of folks comin' over. Two families with six people each, so that's twelve. Then three families with four people each, so that's another twelve.  That's twenty-four people in total. But some got sick, eight of 'em. And two more had somethin' else goin' on. So, twenty-four minus ten... that's fourteen people.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So Solomon got 20 marbles, then he had 50 already, so that's 20 plus 50... that's 70 marbles.

Then his dad gave him some more, 2/5 of the 20 he bought.  That's like, half of 20 is 10, and then half of that is 5... so 8 more marbles.

So now he has 70 plus 8, which is 78 marbles.

Each one weighs 2 kgs, so that's 78 times 2...  

That's 156 kgs!

"Well, if they need 3 wires for every pole, and they got 45 wires, that means they need 15 poles.

"
"Well, lemme see... there were 25 fellas and 15 ladies at first. Then some folks left, right?  They said a quarter of 'em went home.  If 22 fellas are still there, that means 8 ladies are left.

"Hmm, lemme see... the book's four bucks, right? So the magazine's half of that, which is two bucks.  And the pen's a dollar less than the magazine... so that's one dollar.

"
"Well, lemme see... Jam's got 26 pencils, and 2 are just rollin' around. That means she's got 24 in them boxes.  If each box holds the same amount, that's 24 pencils split up into 3 boxes... so each box has 8 pencils. Now, if you add up all the pencils Jam and Meg have, that's 26 plus 46, which is 72 pencils.  To fit all those, you'd need 72 divided by 8 pencils per box... which is 9 boxes.

"
"Well, lemme see... she puts in a bunch of ice cubes to make it cold, right? And each one makes it weaker by a little bit.  If it gets 65 degrees colder, that's gotta be a lot of ice cubes!  And then she puts in cream too, which makes it even weaker.  Hmm... I'd say it's probably like, 75 milliliters weaker.

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 7 new records, right? And you gotta give 2 old ones to get a new one. So, that's 7 times 2...

"
"Okay, so they got a hundred folks workin' there, right? And the young'uns, the junior guys, they make two thousand bucks a month. That's a good chunk of change!  Now, half of 'em are these junior guys, so that's forty of 'em.  The big shots, the seniors, they get four hundred more, so they're makin' two-four-hundred a month. That's sixty of them fancy pants programmers.

So, the juniors are makin' eighty thousand a month all together (forty times two thousand). And the seniors, they're makin' one-forty-four thousand a month (sixty times two-four-hundred).

Add those together, and you get two-twenty-four thousand bucks a month for all them programmers.

"Hmm, lemme see... 20 folks on the bus, and some got off and some got on...  Let's see... 20 plus the 7 that got off is 27. Then take away the 8 that got on, that's 19. And then take away the 5 that got on at the first stop... that leaves 14.

"
"Lemme see... Oscar had 24, ate 2, so that's 22. Then he gave 14 away, so he had 8 left. He bought a bunch more, double what he gave away, so that's 14 times 2, which is 28.  Now he's got 8 plus 28, that's 36! He ate 3, so 36 minus 3 is 33. Then he ate 2 more, so 33 minus 2 is... 31!

"
"Well, it charges up 1% every 3 minutes, right?  And it's at 60% now, so it needs to go up 40% more.  That's like, 40 times 3... hmm... carry the one... that's 120 minutes.  And there's 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 2 hours.

"Well, lemme see... they got $4 off from last time, right? And then that coupon thingy made it double, so that's another $8 off.  So they saved a total of $12.  If they were gonna pay $43, and saved $12, that means they paid... $31.

"Well, lemme see... Job A pays 15 bucks an hour for 2000 hours, so that's 30,000 smackeroos before taxes.  They take out 20%, so that's 6,000 in taxes, leavin' him with 24,000.

Job B is 42,000 straight up, but they take out 6,000 for somethin' called property tax.  Then they take 10% of what's left, which is 3,600 more. That leaves him with 32,400.

So Job B pays him 8,400 more than Job A.

"Hmm, lemme see... so Furniture United wants 1350 bucks up front and then 350 bucks every month for 6 months. That's... uh... 350 times 6 is 2100.  So that's 2100 plus 1350...  that's 3450 bucks total.

Cozy Homes wants 1100 bucks first and then 250 bucks a month for 9 months. So that's 250 times 9... which is 2250.  Plus the 1100, that's 3350 bucks.

So Furniture United is 3450 minus 3350... which is 100 bucks more.

"Well, lemme see... she bought 8 of them things for 8 bucks a pop, so that's 64 bucks to start. Then they went up by half, so that's like addin' 4 bucks to each one, makin' em 12 bucks each.  So now she's got 96 bucks worth. But then they went down by a quarter, so that's like takin' away 3 bucks from each one. So now they're 9 bucks each.  That means she's got 72 bucks worth now.

"Well, lemme see... 200 kids, split into three groups... Two groups are the same size, and the other one's smaller by 10.  Hmm...  

If we take away 10 from 200, that's 190.  And if we split 190 in half, that's 95. So each of the bigger groups has 95 kids.

That means the smallest group has 85 kids.

"
"Well, lemme see...  He's got 60 critters total, right? And twice as many chickens as cows.  Hmm... that means if you took away some chickens, you'd have the same number of cows and chickens.  

So, let's say you took away half the chickens, that'd be 30 critters left. That means he's gotta have 30 cows and 30 chickens.

Cows got 4 legs each, so that's 30 times 4, which is 120 legs. Chickens got 2 legs each, so that's 30 times 2, which is 60 legs.

Add those together, and you get 120 plus 60, which is 180 legs.

"
"Well, he starts with three balls, then adds one more each week for four weeks, so that's... lemme see... three, four, five, six balls.  But then he drops some! Three go down, but two come back, so that's... five balls left.

"
"Well, lemme see... that pink frog weighs 50 pounds, right? And the beetle and toad are the same, so they're 50 too. The snake's bigger, 10 pounds more than the frog, so that's 60. And the bird's smaller, 20 pounds less than the frog, so it's 30.

Add 'em all up: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190.

But don't forget the container! That's another 20 pounds.

So, 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"
"Wow, that's a lotta clothes!  Let's see... she got 24, then double that is... hmm... 48 more. So that's 24 plus 48...  72! And then her momma gave her 15 more?  Okay, so 72 plus 15... that's 87 outfits!

"Well, that Tyson fella runs a whole lotta meters, huh? Five thousand every day! His coach wants him to run a thousand more, so that's six thousand meters a day.

"Hmm, lemme see...  Juice Box A is 4 bucks.  Juice Box B is 5 more than that, so that's 9 bucks. Juice Box C is 7 more than the first one, so that's 11 bucks.

Now, there's 12 months in a year, so 220 times 12...

"Let's see... yoga is an hour. Cookin' is three times that, so that's three hours. Cheese tastin' is a half hour. Museum is half the cookin' so that's... um... hour and a half? And errands are two hours.

"Well, lemme see... She had 36 bucks, right? Then she bought that sweater for 11, so that leaves her with 25. Then she gave her brother 4 bucks, so she musta saved 21.

"
"Well, lemme see... he boated for 6 hours and swam for half that, so that's 3 hours. Then he watched them shows, 3 of 'em at 2 hours each, so that's 6 more hours.  That's 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours right there.

He said that was only 30% of his whole trip, so I guess the whole trip was 15 hours / 0.30, which is 50 hours.

He spent 40% of that sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

20 

"
"Lemme see... she needs 400 bucks for the phone, right? And she already got 80 saved up.  So that's 320 more she needs.

She makes 10 bucks an hour at her first job, and works 20 hours, so that's 200 bucks. Then she makes 5 bucks an hour at her other job for 15 hours, so that's 75 bucks.

That's 275 bucks total from work, plus the 80 she already had, so she's got 355 bucks.

She still needs 45 more dollars.

If each friend costs 30 bucks, she can invite 2 friends.

"Well, lemme see... he had ten bucks, right? And them gumballs cost a nickel a piece, so 40 of them would be two dollars. That means he had eight dollars left after buyin' the candy.

"Well, Carver's 45, right? And his son's a bit younger.  It says Carver's 5 years less than twice his son's age.  So, if we think about it, twice the son's age minus 5 gotta be 45.  Hmm, lemme see...

"Well, lemme see... that train goes a ways, don't it?  

So it goes 75 miles then 100, that's 175. Then it comes back a shorter way, 50 less than that 175, so that's 125.  

That's 175 plus 125, so 300 miles for the whole trip.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 times 3, which is 900 miles a day.

Now, it needs fixin' every 18,000 miles. So, 18,000 divided by 900... hmm... that's 20 days.

"Lemme see... so he needs 2 pounds for each little dog bed and 8 for the big one.  The collie one is in the middle, so that's 5 pounds.  He's makin' 4 little ones, so that's 4 times 2, which is 8 pounds. And 3 collie beds is 3 times 5, which is 15 pounds.  Altogether, that's 8 plus 15...

"Hmm, lemme see...  They got 96 kids in total, and 43 are girls. So that means there's gotta be, like, 53 boys, right?  And then some of 'em were sick, 4 boys I think. So, 53 minus 4... that's 49 boys at school.


49 

"
"Well, lemme see...  There's six girls, right? And there's twice as many boys, so that's like... six times two...  That's twelve boys!  So, six girls plus twelve boys... that's eighteen kids in all.

"Well, lemme see... they kicked out 3 folks for not wearin' masks, right? And then 4 times that many, minus 5, got tossed for stealin'. So that's... lemme grab my fingers... 3 times 4 is 12, minus 5 is 7. So 7 got kicked out for stealin'.

Then they kicked out 3 times that many for fightin' over stuff on sale. So that's 7 times 3...  carry the 1... that's 21 folks for fightin'.

Now, they kicked out 50 people total, so that's 3 plus 7 plus 21...  that's 31.

So, 50 minus 31... that's 19 people kicked out for other stuff.

And they gotta put somethin' fancy on 'em, costin' another 20%...  *scratches head*  That's like...  *counts on fingers again*  Another 176 bucks.

Two of 'em get pins, so that's 2 times 5... 10 bucks.

And the officers, there's a bunch of them, gotta get cords.  *counts on fingers*  That's 11 officers times 12 bucks...  *counts on fingers again*  132 bucks.

"Well, lemme see... she made 56 bucks on Monday, and each apple's 4 dollars, so that's 56 divided by 4... which is 14 apples. Then she picked 12 more on Tuesday, and double that on Wednesday, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24.  Now we just add 'em all up: 14 plus 12 plus 24... that's 50 apples!

Now, she's gotta pay that back over five months. So, 4015 split into five parts... hmm... that's about 803 bucks a month.

"
"Axel got 50 silver and 80 gold. His friend Anna got double the silver, so that's 50 times 2, which is 100 silver. And she got 40 more gold than Axel, so that's 80 plus 40, which is 120 gold.  

So, all together they got 50 plus 100 silver, that's 150 silver. And 80 plus 120 gold, that's 200 gold.

So, 150 silver plus 200 gold is 350 pesos all together.

"Lemonade, huh?  Well, she spent 18 bucks to make it, right? And she gets a dollar a cup.  She makes 36 cups, so that's 36 bucks.  Take away the 18 she spent, and that's 18 bucks profit.  If she sells it all in an hour, she makes 2 bucks every hour.

"Well, if he's got 12.8 hectares left and that's only two-fifths of what he started with, then he musta had a whole lotta land to begin with.  

Let's see... if two-fifths is 12.8, then one-fifth is 12.8 divided by 2, which is 6.4.

And if one-fifth is 6.4, then five-fifths, or the whole thing, is 6.4 times 5, which is 32.

So he had 32 hectares at first.

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 165 popsicles all together, right? And for every 5 Betty got, Sam got 6.  So Sam's got more.  Hmm... if we split them up into groups of 11, that's 15 popsicles each group.  Betty gets 5 groups, so that's 75 popsicles. Sam gets 6 groups, so that's 90 popsicles.  

Sam's got 15 more than Betty.

"
"Well, lemme see... Cable's sixty bucks a month, right? Netflix is ten.  Them other two, Hulu and Disney, they's ten each, so that's twenty. But he gets a deal, saves four bucks 'cause he gets 'em together. So that's sixteen for them two.  Sixteen plus ten for Netflix is twenty-six.  Sixty minus twenty-six... that's thirty-four bucks he saves!


$34 

"
"Well, lemme see... she spent 4 hours writin', then half of that recordin', so that's 2 hours. Then she spent an hour and a half editin'.  That's 4 plus 2 plus 1 and a half, so 7 and a half hours total.

Now,  1 and a half hours outta 7 and a half... hmm... that's like a fifth, right? So, 20%? 


20 

"
"Well, lemme see... she got 6 rows and 6... uh... things in each row, so that's like 6 times 6... which is 36.  Then she wants double that, so that's 36 times 2... which is 72.  And then she wants 20 more on top of that... so 72 plus 20... that's 92 books!

"
"Erica made some cards, then her daddy gave her more.  She gave a bunch away to her friends and family, but then got some more.  Hmm... lemme see... I think she has 38 cards now.

"
"Lemme see... he's got 50 bucks and needs 300 for that bike.  So he's gotta save 250 more. If he makes 10 bucks a day, that's 25 days of work.

"
"Well, lemme see... she saw a whole bunch of spiders, like 90 of 'em! And then some millipedes, but not as many, maybe like 30?  And then some stink bugs, I dunno, maybe like 50?  So, that's a lot of bugs, gotta be over a hundred, right?

168 

"
"Well, lemme see... Erica's 30, right? And Beth's 5 years older, so she's 35.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, makin' her 42.  So, Alice is 12 years older than Erica.

"Hmm, lemme see... Two glasses of milk, huh?  That's a lotta milk!  If each glass has 8 of them ounces, that's 16 ounces total. And each ounce has 3 of them calorie things... so...  carry the one...  

48 

"
"Well, lemme see... he works 4 weeks a month, and that's like, 20 days a month, right?  So that's 20 times 12 months, which is 240 days.  And he makes 50 bucks a day, so that's 240 times 50...  

$12,000 



"
"Well, lemme see... he needs four times the stuff, right? So that's 3 times 4 cups of flour, which is... uh... 12 cups.  Flour comes in them 2-cup bags, so he needs 6 bags. Milk is 1 cup times 4, so that's 4 cups. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 2 bottles.

That means he needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that air conditioner uses a lotta juice, huh?  If he runs it 5 hours less each day, that's gotta save him some money on his electric bill.  

Let's see... 5 hours less times 900... that's 4500 somethin's.  

Now, they said somethin' about kilowatts... I think that's like a bigger unit of electricity.  

So, 4500 somethin's divided by a thousand... that's 4.5 kilowatts saved each day.

And if he does that for a whole month, 30 days...  4.5 times 30... that's 135 kilowatts saved!

"
"Lemme see... two zebras got seventeen stripes each, so that's 17 times 2, which is 34. Then there's one with 36 stripes, and another with, uh, half of 36... that's 18.  So all together, it's 34 plus 36 plus 18, which is 88 stripes.

Now, there's four zebras, so we gotta split those stripes up. 88 stripes split by four zebras... hmm... that's 22 stripes each!


22 

"
"Alright, so he needs enough for 20 folks, and each sandwich feeds 4.  That's 5 sandwiches, right?  Each one needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese. So that's 5 pounds of each. Meat's 7 bucks a pound, so that's 35 bucks. Cheese is 3 bucks a pound, so that's 15 bucks.  Add 'em up, and he's spendin' 50 bucks total.


$50.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... He had 40 of them cannoli things, right? And twice that in corn, so that's 80 corns. Then he gets more cannoli, 60 more, so now he's got a hundred of them. But he got less corn, 40 less than the cannoli, so that's 60 corns.  So, he's got 140 corns and 100 cannoli things.  That's a lotta food!

140 + 100 = 240 

240 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He walked 5,000 steps goin' to and from school, and another 1,000 with his buddy. That's 6,000 steps already.  He needed 2,000 more to get to 10,000, so he musta jogged for 2,000 steps.

2,000 

"
"Well, lemme see... that's a lotta words!  He's gotta read for a half hour, then it takes ten minutes to get there. So that's forty minutes total. He's got a whole hour, so he'll be there twenty minutes early.

20 

"
"Well, lemme see... they hired 40 folks and paid 'em 15 bucks an hour for 40 hours a week. That's 600 bucks a week per person, right? So in May, that's 600 times 4 weeks, which is 2400 bucks a month per person.  

Now, they lost a quarter of 'em in June, so that's 10 people gone.  So they only got 30 left. Still payin' 'em 2400 a month each.

So, May was 40 people times 2400, which is 96,000. June is 30 people times 2400, which is 72,000.

Add those together, and you get 168,000.

$168,000 



"
"Lemme see... she had ten bucks, right?  That taffy deal is tricky. Two pounds is like, four dollars and fifty cents.  Seashells are a buck fifty, and them magnets are a quarter each, so that's a dollar.  

So, she spent, uh... four fifty plus one fifty plus one dollar... that's six fifty.  Ten minus six fifty... she got three dollars left.


$3.00 

"
"Lemme see... he bought one pack for 400 bucks, and another one that's twice as much, so that's 400 times 2, which is 800.  That's 400 plus 800, so 1200 bucks total.  But wait, he got a discount, 20% off.  That's like, 1200 times 0.20, which is 240 bucks off. So it's 1200 minus 240, which is 960.  And then he got that big finale thing for 150 bucks.  So all together, it's 960 plus 150... that's 1110 bucks!


$1110
"
"Well, she eats 2 cookies every night, right? And she wants them to last a whole month, which is like 30 days. So that's 2 times 30... hmm... lemme see...  that's 60 cookies she needs.

Now, a dozen is 12, so she needs 60 divided by 12...  carry the one... that's 5 dozens!

"
"Well, if 1% of them blow up, that's 500 candles, right? And 5% of those smell like a wet dog... so that's gotta be... lemme see...  25 candles.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them blouses are on sale for 30% off, so that's like... 6 bucks off each one.  So each one costs 14 bucks.  If she buys 4, that's 14 times 4...  

$56 

"
"Well, lemme see... Joanne got 30 from the big trees, and half that from the little ones, so that's 15.  Her sister got double from the big ones, so that's 60, and triple from the little ones, so that's 45.  That's 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the big and little trees together.

So Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the ones in the middle.


350 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 180 heads in total, right? And each camel has two humps, while them dromedaries only got one.  If they got 304 humps all together, that means there's gotta be a whole bunch of dromedaries.  

I reckon there's 56 dromedaries. 



"
"Well, lemme see... he drove 200 clicks a day for four days, so that's 200 times 4, which is 800. Then he did a lot less for a couple days, like a third of that, so maybe 240 more?  And then he took a day off, so nothin' there.  The second week he did 300 clicks every day for seven days, so that's 300 times 7, which is 2100.  

Now, if you add all that up... 800 plus 240 plus 2100... that's a whole lotta clicks!  3140!


3140
"
"Well, lemme see... Peter's locker is like, a quarter the size of Zack's, and it's 5 inches. So Zack's gotta be 5 times bigger, right? That's 25 inches. And Timothy's is twice as big as Zack's, so... that's 50 inches!

"
"Well, Stanley's comb fell a ways down, right?  He was way up high, ten thousand feet! And it fell four thousand feet. So that puts it at six thousand feet.  Oliver's down at three thousand feet.  So he gotta climb... hmm... three thousand feet to get to it.


3000 

"
"That's a lotta money! So he got 4000 from one bank, and then double that from the other, so that's 4000 times 2, which is 8000.  Then you add that to the 4000, so that's 12000.  And then you add that to the 5000 he already had, so that's 17000!

$17000 

"
"Well, lemme see... Them boats took a whole bunch of kitties, like 20 I think. Then, a bunch more ran off chasin' somethin'.  I reckon there's maybe... 12 left?

"
"Okay, so he pays eight bucks a month for six months, that's like... forty-eight dollars. Then it goes up to twelve bucks a month, so that's, uh, ninety-six dollars for eight months. Then it goes up again to fourteen bucks, so that's another... hmm... one hundred and twelve dollars.

So, all together, it's forty-eight plus ninety-six plus one hundred and twelve...  

256 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... those fancy jeans were on sale, huh?  So he got the ripped ones for 28 bucks, and the other ones were cheaper by 6 bucks. That means they were 22 bucks.  

Now, he saved a total of 6 bucks, and he got a third of that from the cheaper jeans. That's 2 bucks. So the rest, 4 bucks, came off the ripped ones.

Those ripped jeans were 28 bucks, but he saved 4, so they were originally 32 bucks.

The other ones were 22 bucks, and he saved 2, so they were originally 24 bucks.

So, the jogger jeans were 24 bucks originally, and the ripped ones were 32 bucks. That means the jogger jeans were 8 bucks cheaper.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got four big buses, those hold a lotta folks, like sixty each.  Then there's them smaller ones, six of 'em, hold thirty each. And ten little vans, fifteen in each of those.  

Let's see... four times sixty is two-forty... then six times thirty is one-eighty... and ten times fifteen is one-fifty... add those up... two-forty plus one-eighty plus one-fifty... that's five-seventy!

570 

"
"Well, she made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more, so that's 6 in total.  If each one gets 20 birdies, that's 6 times 20... which is 120. But hold on, she said the ones she made are better and get 10 more birdies each. So those get 30 extra birdies...  

120 + 30 is 150 birdies!


150 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... bagel was 4 bucks, and the soup was a bit more, like a quarter more, so that's... lemme see... 4 plus a dollar, so 5 bucks for the soup. Cake was half the bagel, so that's 2 bucks.  

So, 4 plus 5 plus 2... that's 11 bucks! 


11
"
"Well, lemme see... He wants a hundred bucks for the park and has fifty left over, so he made fifty bucks from the cards, right?  If he gets a buck fifty for each one, that's gotta be thirty-three cards he sold.  But he kept some, so he musta had more than that to start.  Hmm...  If he sold two-thirds, then he kept one-third, so he musta had, like, fifty cards at the start. 


50 

"
"Well, lemme see... he made enough for half the folks to have two, so that's like 36 divided by 2, which is 18 folks gettin' two hot dogs.  That's 18 times 2, plus 18 more, so he had 54 hot dogs total. But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted seconds.  Hmm... 54 hot dogs split in half is 27 folks gettin' seconds. So 40 minus 27... that's 13 folks who didn't get a second hot dog.

"Indras name has six letters. Her sister's name has three plus four, so that's seven.  Six plus seven is thirteen.

She needs 1 more dollar.

"
"Well, lemme see... 15 gallons split into 5 jugs is 3 gallons each.  Josey needs a quarter of that, so that's like... less than a whole gallon.  Hmm... a gallon's got a bunch of pints in it, right?  I think it's like 8 pints. So, a quarter of a gallon would be... 6 pints, I reckon.

"
"Well, lemme see... he had five bucks, right? And he got three bags of chips, which is like, a dollar twenty. So that leaves him with, uh... three eighty-five?  

Then he had a little bit left over, like a nickel. So he spent, like, four ninety-five on candy bars. Each candy bar is seventy-five cents, so... that's gotta be five candy bars.

"
"Well, lemme see... that room's a rectangle, right? So, it's like a big ol' box.  They say it's 3 yards long, and that's like 9 feet, 'cause there's 3 feet in every yard.  

Now, they say the whole room is 360 square feet. That's like, if you covered the whole floor with squares, you'd need 360 of 'em.  

To find out how wide it is, you gotta divide the 360 by the length, which is 9 feet. So, 360 divided by 9 is 40 feet wide.

Now, to get the perimeter, you gotta add up all the sides. That's two lengths and two widths. So, 9 plus 40 is 49, and then double that is 98.

So the answer is 98. 


98
"
"Well, lemme see... Elizabeth got one pack of red and two packs of clear, so that's three packs total. Margareth got three packs of blue and four packs of red, so that's seven packs.  If each pack has twenty beads, then Margareth has a whole lotta more beads than Elizabeth.  

Let's see... seven packs times twenty beads... that's...  carry the one...  one hundred and forty beads! Elizabeth only has... three packs times twenty... sixty beads.

So Margareth has eighty more beads than Elizabeth.

"
"Well, see, the oven makes it hotter, right?  So it goes up 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 degrees hotter.

Then he opens the window, and that makes it cooler. It goes down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, and he has the window open for 30 minutes, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 degrees cooler.

So it starts at 40, goes up 15, then down 6.  That's 40 + 15 - 6, which is 49.


49 

"
"Well, lemme see... Jon took a long time, right?  Swim, bike, then run.  That James fella, he's quicker in the water, but slower on the bike.  Jon won by ten minutes, so James musta made up some time on the run.  Hmm...  I'd say James probably ran for about 39 minutes.

"Well, lemme see... It went 60 miles an hour for two hours, so that's 60 times 2, which is 120 miles. Then it went slower, 30 miles an hour for one hour, so that's 30 more miles.  That's 150 miles total.

It drove for 3 hours all together. So, 150 miles divided by 3 hours... that's 50 miles an hour.

Let's see... ten boxes times 32 feet of dirt each... that's 320 feet of dirt he needs.  And each bag has two feet, so he needs 160 bags.

Now, each bag costs $12, so 160 bags times $12...  carry the one... that's $1920.

$1920

"Hmm, lemme see... so there's 15 red ones, and then they say there's 60% more green ones...  that's like, uh... more than half again, right? So that's gotta be a bunch more green ones.  And then the yellow ones are the same as all the red and green put together?

"Well, lemme see... Frank starts with 200 shoes, right? Then he gets a bunch more, like 5 pairs on Monday, then 15 more on Wednesday, and a whole lotta shoes, 30 pairs, on Friday.  That's a lot of shoes!  

So, that's 200 + (5 times 2) + (15 times 2) + (30 times 2) = 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

But then he gets rid of a bunch on Saturday, 180 of 'em. So, 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"
"Well, lemme see... Mary's got a lotta sprinkles, six jars worth!  Each jar does a whole lotta cupcakes, 'bout eight I reckon. So that's a whole heap of cupcakes, like, 48 of 'em! Now, each pan holds a dozen, so she's gonna need... hmm... four pans, I think.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she bought a pen for two bucks, and the paper... that's tricky. Three times the pen is six bucks, take away a dollar... that's five bucks for the paper. So, two plus five is seven bucks total. She gave ten, so... three bucks back.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 30 kids with 10 pencils each, that's a lotta pencils!  They used a bunch, then some more were gone by the end of the year.  I'd say they probably had 'bout 80 left.

"
"Well, lemme see... He wants 5 cookies, right? And he gets 2 extra for cleanin' his room. So that's 3 cookies he gotta earn with carrots.  If he gets half a cookie for each carrot, he needs to eat 6 carrots.

"
"That shark's a big fella!  Them little remoras ain't much compared to that.  I'd say they're maybe... 10% of the shark's size.

"
"Well, if 20 kids don't have computers, and that's a quarter of the class, then there must be 4 groups of 20 kids, right?

80 

"
"Well, lemme see... three weeks is like, a lotta days, right?  And he walks four days a week. So that's a whole bunch of walkin'!  

He's gotta walk for 240 minutes, so if he spreads it out over all those days, it's gonna be a little bit each day.  

Hmm, I dunno, maybe like... a few minutes each day?


2.86 

"
"Well, lemme see... she spent 300 bucks on books, and each one cost 15 bucks. So that's 300 divided by 15, which is 20 books. Then she gives them to her 4 kids, so each kid gets 20 divided by 4...  

5 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 32 kids total... some are allergic to stuff.  Nine to dairy, six to peanuts... and three to both, huh?  So that's...  *counts on fingers*  12 kids with allergies.  That leaves... 20 kids without allergies! 


20
"
"Well, lemme see... they got 3 groups of folks, and each group's got 200 people. So that's 3 times 200, which is... uh... 600 people! And then there's 7 helpers for each group, so that's 3 times 7... which is 21 helpers.  

So, 600 people plus 21 helpers... that's a whole lotta folks!  

621 



"
"Okay, so the tickets cost a whole lotta money, five thousand each, so that's ten thousand right there.  The hotel's fancy 'cause it's a busy time, so it costs more.  They said it's twenty percent more, and that's on top of fifteen hundred a day.  So, that's, uh... lemme see...  

*counts on fingers*

That's three hundred more each day, so the hotel's eighteen hundred a day.  They're stayin' three days, so that's...

*counts on fingers again*

Five thousand four hundred for the hotel.  

Now, add that to the tickets...

*counts on fingers some more*

Fifteen thousand four hundred dollars!  That's a lot for a trip!

"
"Ben's got a lotta paint, huh?  Four blues and three yellows.  Jasper's got half as much blue as Ben, so that's two blues. And three times the yellows, so that's nine yellows!  Two blues plus nine yellows... lemme see... that's eleven tubes for Jasper.


11 

"
"That 2010 penny's a lot lighter, huh?  If the old one weighs 48, and the new one's only three-quarters that, it's gotta be 36.  So, all together, they weigh 84.

$240 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... Her shoes were eighty bucks, right?  So her bag was like, three times that, but then twenty less...  So, three times eighty is two-forty... then take away twenty... that's two-twenty!


$220 

"
"Well, lemme see... he runs 12 miles a day, and he does that for 5 days, so that's 60 miles a week.  If he runs 10 miles every hour, that means he runs for 6 hours a week.

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got four horses, and they each eat five pounds of oats at a time, twice a day. So that's ten pounds a day per horse.  Four horses is forty pounds a day.  Five days is... hmm... carry the one... that's two hundred pounds of oats.  Now, each bag has fifty pounds, so he needs... four bags!

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Jana's got a whole lotta puppies, 27 of 'em!  And most of 'em, two-thirds, are them fluffy Pomeranians.  So that's like... 18 Pomeranians, right?  And then, a third of those are girl Pomeranians... so that's gotta be... 6!

"
"Brrr, that's cold!  Let's see...  Add those numbers up, then split it by three.  That's like sharin' a big ol' bag of ice cubes with your buddies.

"
"Lemme see... the toy costs twelve bucks, and he's got four already. So that's eight bucks he needs more. If he saves two bucks a day, it'll take him four days.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He got two of them trays, right? And each one holds, what was it, 24 eggs? So that's 24 plus 24, which is 48 eggs.  But he got 64 eggs total.  So, 64 minus 48... that's 16 eggs left over.


16 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that big pizza costs three times more than the little one, so that's 8 times 3... which is 24.  Then you gotta add the little one's price, so 24 plus 8... that's 32 bucks!


$32 

"
"Well, lemme see... them razors come in packs of four, right? And she's buyin' two packs, so that's eight razors total.  They're four bucks a pack, so two packs is eight bucks. But hold on, there's a buy one get one free deal goin' on, so that cuts it in half... so four bucks. And she's got a two dollar coupon, so that makes it two bucks for all eight razors.  

That means each razor costs a quarter, which is 25 cents.


25 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They got nine gals all the same height, and one little one.  So, most of 'em are pretty tall, right?  They stack up like a big ol' tower, four on the bottom, then three, then two, and the littlest one on top.  That's a lotta gals!  Gotta be pretty darn tall, I reckon.  

53 

"
"Well, lemme see... she works 8 hours a day, and takes a break every hour for 5 minutes. So that's 5 minutes a hour times 8 hours... that's 40 minutes a day.  And if she does that for 5 days, that's 40 times 5...  

200 

"
"Well, lemme see... Brett's gonna be 18 in four years, right? And his sister's gonna be three times that, so that's like... 18 times 3...  carry the one... that's 54! But that's in four years, so she's gotta be 50 now.

"
"Well, lemme see... He drives twice a day, so that's like 2 times 14 days, which is 28 trips.  Each trip costs him $8, so 28 times 8... hmm... that's a lotta eights...

"
"Ashley brought a whole lotta oranges, like fifty! Brianne brought even more, like seventy!  That's a whole bunch of oranges, gotta be over a hundred!  If each pie needs three oranges, they can make a ton of pies, maybe forty?

"
"Well, lemme see...  

That first place costs 200 bucks just to be there, plus 5 bucks for each person's food. The second place is 25 bucks a person, and that includes the food.

Hmm... if we got 10 people, the first place would be 200 plus 50 bucks for food, so 250 total. The second place would be 250 bucks too!

So I guess you need 10 people.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 43 bugs all together, right?  And Lily found more than that David fella. David only got half of what Bodhi found.  

Gosh, that's a lot to think about.  Let's see... if I had 43 bugs and split 'em up...  

*counts on fingers*

Lily musta found 16 bugs!

"Well, let's see... Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, and her grandma used half. That's like, a whole lotta yarn!  A whole skein is 364 yards, so Mariah used 91 yards, and her grandma used 182 yards.  Add those together, and they used 273 yards.

"
"Let's see... she buys 5 gifts for two of 'em, so that's 10. Then 2 gifts for the other three, so that's 6 more.  Then she gets 10 more on top of that...  

10 + 6 + 10 = 26

"
"Well, lemme see... the rug's bigger than the chair by 5 feet, so that's 3 plus 5, which is 8 feet.  Then the couch is, whatchamacallit, twice the rug plus 2 feet. So that's 8 times 2, which is 16, plus 2 more... that's 18 feet!


18 

"
"Well, she bought two packs of strawberry, right? And all the gum cost $7.  She spent $2 on grape and $1 on that green stuff. So that's $3 gone. That leaves $4 for the strawberry.  

$4 split between two packs is $2 a pack.

"
"Well, lemme see...  He wants the most sticks, right?  Those 2x8s give ya more sticks for yer money.  If he buys four of them, that's 400 sticks each, so that's a whole lotta popsicles!

Hmm, that's a lot of zeros... lemme get my calculator...

$288.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... she takes the bus twice a day, and that's $2.20 each time, so that's $4.40 a day.  Five days a week, that's $4.40 times 5, which is $22. But the pass is only $20. So she saves... hmm... $22 minus $20... that's $2!


$2.00 

"
"Well, lemme see...  Thirty cows plus twenty sheep... that's fifty right there.  Then the zoo's got double the cows, so that's sixty more.  And the farm's got half the sheep, so that's ten.  So, sixty plus twenty is eighty, and eighty plus forty is...

"Rose got a whole lotta onions and potatoes, like four times more than me! She got 12 onions, so I got 3. And she got 4 potatoes, so I got 1.  That's 4 things in total I got.

"
"Well, shoot, 30 pounds is a lot!  I reckon if he wants to lose that by July, he better start cuttin' back on the grub.  

Let's see... 30 pounds times 3500... that's a whole lotta calories, like 105,000!  

Now, how many days 'til July?  About 200, I guess.

So, 105,000 calories split up over 200 days... that's gotta be...  525 calories less each day.

525 

"
"He makes 30 bucks a day, and he worked all week, so that's like 30 times 7, which is 210. Then he spent a hundred, so he's got 110 left.

"
"Well, lemme see... she runs 8 laps, and each one is a quarter of a kilometer, so that's like 2 kilometers total, right?  And she needs 60 of them milliliter things for every kilometer. So, 2 times 60... that's 120!


120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Julie had five hundred bucks, right? She spent a fifth of that on clothes, so that's a hundred gone.  Leaves her with four hundred. Then she spends a quarter of that on CDs, so another hundred gone.  That means she's got three hundred left.


$300 

"
"Well, if the house cost three times more than the land, that means the land is like one part and the house is three parts.  That's four parts in total, right?

So, if all four parts cost $120,000, then one part, which is the land, costs $120,000 divided by 4. That's $30,000.

The house is three parts, so it costs three times that, which is $30,000 times 3. That's $90,000.

$90,000 

"
"Well, lemme see... she bought a bunch of bags, right? Eight packs of 'em, five in each pack. So that's, uh... forty bags total.

She paid four bucks a pack, so that's... hmm...  carry the one...  $160.

Then she sold 'em for eight bucks each, so that's...  eight times forty...  $320!

So she made... $320 minus $160...  $160 profit! 


$160

"Well, lemme see... he throws a lotta punches, that's for sure.  25 every minute, and they fight for, what was it, 5 rounds?  Each round's 3 minutes, so that's 15 minutes total.

He spends most of that on dinner, three-fifths of it... hmm... that's like, sixty bucks? So he's got twenty left over.

"
"Well, lemme see... Rob takes 2 hours, that's like 120 minutes, right?  Double that is 240. And Royce takes 40 more minutes than that, so... 240 plus 40... that's 280 minutes.


280 

"
"Let's see... she needs a whole lotta yarn!  

Three kids, that's a lot of hats and scarves and sweaters.  Hmm, lemme count it up... 2 for the hat, 4 for the scarf, 12 for the sweater... that's already 18!  Then she needs some for the mittens and socks too...  

I bet she needs at least 60 skeins, maybe more. 


63
"
"Okay, so he did 12 the first day, then 3 times that the next day, so that's like 12 times 3, which is 36.  That's 12 plus 36, so 48 problems done.

He had 100 to start, so he had 100 minus 48 left, which is 52.

Then he did a quarter of those on Wednesday, so that's 52 divided by 4, which is 13.

So he had 52 minus 13 left, which is 39.

"
"Tony picks a lotta strawberries, like 6 big buckets full every hour! Bobby's a little slower, he gets 5 buckets. Kathy's real fast, she gets double Bobby, so that's 10 buckets! Ricky's pretty good too, he gets 8 buckets.  

If you add all them buckets up, that's 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 buckets!

"They baked a whole lotta bread, like two hundred! Then they sold a bunch, like over a hundred in the mornin' and some more in the afternoon.  Some even got sent back from the store.  Hmm, lemme see...  I think they had 'bout sixty-two loaves left.

"Well, lemme see... she's got 27 cups of raisins, and she wants to split 'em up even for cookies, granola, and that snack mix stuff. So that's 9 cups for each thing.  Those cookies need 3/4 of a cup, so... hmm... 9 divided by 3/4...  That's like asking how many 3/4 cups are in 9 cups.  Let's see... 9, 12... yeah, she can make 12 batches of cookies.

In a week, that's 3 times 7... 21 extra bucks.


$21.00 

"
"Well, if one fella can do half a house in five days, that means it takes him ten days to do the whole thing.  Now, if you got five fellas workin', they'd get it done way faster.  Hmm... five times faster, so that'd be two days!  And two days is 48 hours.

"
"Well, Ophelia's got 20 sofas, right? And she's got 2 more chairs than sofas, so that's 22 chairs. Jenna's got a whole lotta chairs, like three times Ophelia's, so that's 22 times 3, which is... lemme see... 66 chairs!  And Jenna's got 2 less sofas than chairs, so she's got 64 sofas.  

Altogether, they got a bunch of sofas, 20 plus 64, which is 84. And chairs, 22 plus 66, that's 88. So, all together, they got 84 sofas and 88 chairs. That's a lot of furniture!

"Well, lemme see... Jame's gonna be 27 in five years, so he's 22 now.  In eight years, he'll be 30. His cousin's gonna be 55 then, 'cause twice Jame's age is 60, and then you take away 5.  So the cousin's 47 now. That means the cousin's 25 years older than Jame.


25 

"
"Well, lemme see... he spent a thousand-one hundred on that fancy computer thingy. And the printer was four hundred bucks less, so that's seven hundred.  That's eighteen hundred right there. So the two screens musta cost six hundred, which means each one cost... three hundred dollars!

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 20 kids, right?  And they split 'em up even, so that's 10 boys and 10 girls. Them boys found 60 shells each, so that's a whole lotta shells!  The girls, they found even more, like, way more. They got the boys' shells plus four times that much.  So, that's 60 times 4, which is... lemme count on my fingers... 240!  

So the girls got 60 plus 240, which is 300 shells.  And since there's 10 girls, they each got 30 shells.

"George had 3 candies, but he ate some, so he had more before.  He ate 5, so he had 3 plus 5, which is 8. Nick had twice as many as George, so Nick had 8 times 2, which is 16.

"Lemme see... she bought three of them apples at a dollar fifty each, so that's... lemme grab a pen...  three times a dollar fifty...  that's four fifty. Then she got five oranges at eighty cents a pop, so that's... hmm... five times eighty... four dollars. And six peaches at seventy-five cents each... that's... six times seventy-five... four fifty again.

80 

"
"Well, he walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, so that's 6 miles a day.  If he does that 5 days a week, he walks 6 times 5, which is 30 miles.

27 times 3 is 81.

"Lemme see... he wants five of them notebooks, right? So that's 5 times a dollar fifty... hmm... lemme grab my calculator... that's $7.50.

Then he wants two pens, those are a quarter each, so that's 50 cents.

The calculator is a big one, that's $12. And the geometry thingy is $10.

So, all together that's $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10...  

*counts on fingers*

That's $30! But wait, they give a discount, right? 10% off...  

*scratches head*

"Lemme see... five burgers at four bucks a pop, that's twenty bucks. Fries are thirty cents each, so ten of them is three bucks. Drinks are two bucks a piece, so five of those is ten bucks.

He needs to get, like, ninety-two more bottles then.

"Well, lemme see... If he swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold, and it takes him twice as long plus 2 minutes when it's warm, that's 32 plus 2, so 34 minutes for a mile when it's hot.

Three miles in the cold is 16 times 3, so 48 minutes.

Three miles in the heat is 34 times 3, so 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 minus 48, which is 54 minutes longer when it's hot.

"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 10 bucks a day, right?  'Cause 2 dollars an hour times 5 hours is 10. And he works 4 days a week, so that's 40 bucks a week.  He wants 80 bucks, so that's two weeks worth of work.

"
"That fish sandwich is forty bucks?!  Man, that's a lot.  And the cold cut thing is three times that?  So that's... lemme see...  three times forty is... uh... one hundred and twenty!  So that's a hundred and twenty plus forty...  

$160 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 21 buttons... some got two holes, some got four...  

Let's see... 21 minus 7 is 14 buttons with four holes. That's 14 times 4... which is 56 holes.

Then the other ones, 7 times 2 is 14 holes.

So, 56 plus 14... that's 70 holes!

"Timmy's locker is big, like, twice the size of Zack's. And Peter's locker is teeny tiny, like a quarter of Zack's. So Peter's gotta be real small, like 3 cubic inches maybe?

"Well, Juan drinks a whole lotta coffee!  If he's gotta cut back to just 4 cups, he's drinkin' way too much now.  Gotta be like, 5 times more than that, right? So he's gotta cut back by a bunch!

5 times 4 cups is 20 cups, so he's gotta cut back by 16 cups.

"Lemme see...  They got three cages with ten of them squirrely hamster things, so that's thirty. And three cages with five of them piggies, so that's fifteen.  Thirty plus fifteen...

"Mark's a big fella, 150 pounds! Susan's smaller, she's 20 pounds lighter, so that's 130 pounds. Now Bob, he's a big eater, twice as much as Susan, so he's 260 pounds.  

Add 'em all up, 150 + 130 + 260, that's 540 pounds.  

Divide that by 3, 'cause there's three of 'em, and you get 180.

180

"Well, the sun goes up, right?  And it starts at the pointy top of the pyramid. If it goes up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours, that's like... 50 degrees more up in the sky.  So, it's gonna be way up there, like 82 degrees from the ground!

"
"Well, lemme see...  He's got one kid who's 12, and the other one's 8. That's 20 candles they need.  Those candle packs got 5 in 'em, so he needs 4 packs.  If each pack's 3 bucks, that's 4 times 3...

"Well, lemme see... she read for a whole week, that's like, seven days, right? And every day she read for 15 minutes. So that's a lotta readin'! Then she read a hundred pages the next week.  Hmm, pages are kinda hard to figure out.  But if she reads two pages every minute and a half, that's a lot of pages!  

Let's see... 15 times 7 is... uh... 105.  And then she read a hundred more.  So that's... 205 pages!

"Richie scored a whole lotta goals, 80! Mark got 20 less than him, so that's 60. And Anna, she got 45 less than Richie, so that's 35.

"Well, lemme see... he's got 70 bucks, right? And he spends 5 bucks a day for four days, so that's 20 bucks gone.  Leaves him with 50 bucks.  Those plastic guys are 2 bucks a pop, so he can get 25 of them. Plus the 4 wooden ones, that's a whole lotta action figures!

"Dang, kittens are expensive!  That spaying thing cost two hundred bucks! Then them shots were twenty bucks a pop, so that's sixty more. And she busted four of my momma's vases, twelve bucks each, so that's... lemme see... forty-eight more.  

So, two hundred plus sixty plus forty-eight... that's three hundred and eight bucks!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that Ford fella grows 40 roses a week, right? And them shops want 20, 15, and 30... so that's 65 roses they need.  He's short 25 roses every week.  A month has 4 weeks, so he's short...  carry the one... 100 roses every month! 


100 

"
"Well, lemme see... she starts with three thousand bucks, right? And she takes out a hundred every month.  That's twelve hundred a year, so in two years, she's taken out two thousand four hundred.  So, she's got six hundred left.

"Lemme see... they spend 3 bucks on bread and that makes 10 sammiches. So each sammich costs 30 cents for bread. Then they got 30 bucks for cheese and stuff for 10 sammiches, so that's 3 bucks per sammich.  

So each sammich costs 3 bucks and 30 cents, right? They sell 'em for 7 bucks a pop.  

That means they make 3 bucks and 70 cents profit on each one.

If they sell 10, that's 37 bucks profit!

"Well, lemme see... she got 3 boxes times 64 crayons in each box, so that's a whole lotta crayons!  That's 192 crayons.  She makes 'em into muffins with 8 crayons each, so she can make 24 muffins.  If she sells 'em for a buck fifty each, that's 24 times 1.50...

Let's see... the room's 18 by 12, so that's 18 times 12, which is... uh... 216 somethin's.  

The carpet's 12 bucks a somethin', so that's 216 times 12...  carry the one...  that's a lotta money, like 2592 bucks!

And then there's the padding, which is 2 bucks a somethin', so that's another 432 bucks.

Then they gotta rip up the old stuff, which is 4 bucks a somethin', so that's 864 bucks.

And finally, puttin' the new stuff down is 34 bucks a somethin', so that's a whopping 7344 bucks!

Add it all up... 2592 plus 432 plus 864 plus 7344...  man, that's a lot of zeros!  It's gonna cost him 11232 bucks!

Hmm, seven days... so many birds...  I reckon it's 'bout forty birds a day, give or take.

"Lemme see... 20 plus half of itself is 30.  Then you chop that in half, which is 15.  Then you take 20 and take away 12, which is 8.  And then you multiply 15 by 8...

"Well, shoot, that oven's hotter'n a firecracker!  If it's 18 degrees hotter than it should be at 450, then at 520, it's gonna be way too hot.

"Well, Herb's house cost a whole lotta money, seventy-six thousand dollars! Juan's house is cheaper, though.  He said it's thirty percent less, so that's like, a whole bunch less.  Hmm, lemme see... thirty percent of seventy-six thousand...  

*counts on fingers*

That's twenty-two thousand eight hundred less! So Juan's house is fifty-three thousand two hundred dollars.

Now, to find out how much both houses are together, we gotta add 'em up. Seventy-six thousand plus fifty-three thousand two hundred...

*counts on fingers again*

That's one hundred twenty-nine thousand two hundred dollars!

"Well, lemme see... Judy had 12 cups and then got twice as many dishes, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24 dishes.  That's 12 plus 24, or 36 things she brought. Her friend had 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 44 dishes.  That's 40 plus 44, which is 84 things her friend brought.  Now, we gotta add up what they both brought... 36 plus 84...

"Well, lemme see...  He gets 90 contacts in a box, and that lasts him 45 days, so that's two contacts a day.  Two boxes is 180 contacts, right?  And they're on sale for 90 bucks a box, so that's 180 bucks for two boxes.  So, 180 contacts for 180 bucks... that's a dollar a contact.

"Well, Jill worked 2 hours one day and 1 the next, so that's 3 hours total.  John worked way more, like double on the first day and triple on the second, so that's 4 hours plus 3 hours, which is 7 hours.  If they get 10 bucks an hour, John made 70 bucks and Jill made 30.

"Well, lemme see...  They got a whole bunch of jelly beans, right?  

Blue ones, red ones, and green ones.  

It says there's a little less red than blue, and a little more green than blue.  

If there's 4500 jelly beans all together, I reckon there's gotta be more green than red by a good bit.

I'd say... maybe 30 more green than red?

"Well, lemme see... he started at 47, then went up to 52, and then goes up another 5... that's 57, right?  So, uh... 47 plus 52 plus 57...  carry the one... that's 156.  Now we gotta split that up into three parts... 156 divided by 3... hmm... that's 52!

"Well, if he's losin' 1.25 pounds a week with the Cheerios, that's like 6 pounds in 5 weeks. But with donuts, he's gainin' 1.75 a week, so that's like 9 pounds in 5 weeks.  

So, he'd be 3 pounds heavier eatin' donuts.

"Okay, so she invited a hundred folks, and they each bring two buddies, so that's a lotta people!  That's 100 times 2, which is 200.  So that's 300 people already!

"Hmm, lemme see... that little Affenpinscher is tiny, only 10 pounds.  The Dachshund's a bit bigger, twice that size, so 20 pounds.

So that's four thousand five hundred.  He already paid six hundred, so he needs... lemme see... three thousand nine hundred more dollars.

If he makes fifteen bucks an hour, he gotta work...  uhhh...  carry the one...  two hundred and sixty hours.

"Well, lemme see...  If you add up all the angles in a triangle, it's gotta be 180, right?  And one angle is like, double the smallest one, and another is triple the smallest.  Hmm... that means the smallest one plus double itself plus triple itself gotta equal 180.  

That's like, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so the smallest one is 30.  And the biggest one is triple that, so it's 90.

"Lemme see... he's got a bunch of coins, right?  Let's see... eight quarters is two dollars, I know that.  Six dimes is... uh... sixty cents.  Fourteen nickels is... hmm... seventy cents! And fifteen pennies is... fifteen cents.  

So that's two dollars plus sixty cents plus seventy cents plus fifteen cents... that's three dollars and fifty-five cents!

Now, each gumball costs a nickel, which is five cents.  So he can buy... a whole lotta gumballs!  Let's see... three dollars is sixty nickels, and fifty-five cents is eleven nickels... so that's seventy-one nickels.

He can buy seventy-one gumballs!

"Lemme see... he gets 5 games right off the bat. Then he gets one a month for a whole year, so that's 12 more. Plus 5 for Christmas, that's 22 games that first year.

The next year he gets double the games each month, so that's 24 more. Plus another 5 for Christmas, so that's 51 games total.

Year three he's gettin' 4 games a month, so that's a whole lotta games!  That's 48 more, plus 5 for Christmas, so that's 104 games!

"Well, that plane's movin' pretty fast!  If it goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, that's like 400 miles every hour.  So to go another 2000 miles, it'd take... lemme see... 2000 divided by 400...  that's 5 hours!

That's 12 bucks.

"Hmm, lemme see... so he's got 50 bucks, right?  And that shirt's 25, but it's on sale for 30% off... so that's like... a few bucks less. And the shorts are 35, but they're on sale too.  

Let's see... 25 minus... uh... 30% of 25 is...  *counts on fingers*  about 7 bucks less. So the shirt's 18 bucks. And the shorts are... 35 minus... *counts on fingers again*  about 10 bucks less, so they're 25 bucks.

And every month after those first 5 cost 50% more, so that's like... half again as much?  So each of those months cost 150,000.  

That's 45 months times 150,000...  carry the one...  that's a lotta money, 6,750,000!

Add that to the first 500,000, and it's 7,250,000 bucks!

"Hmm, lemme see...  They got 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats, so that's a lotta seats!  That's 4 times 18...  carry the one...  72 seats in total.

The bigwigs took up a quarter of them, so that's 72 divided by 4... 18 seats for the bosses.

That leaves 54 seats left. The parents took a third of those, so that's 54 divided by 3... another 18 seats.

So, that means 54 minus 18 equals... 36 seats for the kids.

But they had to buy the cars first, and that cost 'em 30% of that, so... lemme do that... 250,000 times 0.30... that's 75,000.  So they made 175,000 profit.

"Well, lemme see... that diamond thing is two thousand bucks. The gold one is, like, a little less than that, four outta five of the diamond price. So that's... hmm... sixteen hundred? And the silver one is cheaper by four hundred, so that's twelve hundred.  

Now, if you add all that up... two thousand plus sixteen hundred plus twelve hundred... that's four thousand eight hundred dollars!

"Lemme see... he got 16 of them snowflake ones. Then he got 3 more of them truck ones, so that's 16 plus 3, which is 19.  And then he got 9 less of them flower ones, so that's 19 minus 9, which is 10.  So he got 16 plus 19 plus 10...  carry the one... that's 45 stamps!

"
"Well, lemme see... Tom's gotta make up 75 miles, right? And he's goin' 15 miles faster than Bob.  So, it's like he's closin' the gap 15 miles every hour.

"Well, lemme see...  He's diggin' a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That's a right good sized hole!  So that's 6 times 4 times 3...  carry the one...  that's 72 cubic feet of dirt he's gotta move.

If it takes him 3 seconds for every cubic foot, that's 72 times 3...  

216 seconds. 



"
"Lemme see... so the truck is 30,000 bucks to start. Then that fancy cab thing is 7500 more.  The leather seats are a third of that, so that's 2500.  The runnin' boards are 500 less than the seats, so 2000. And the lights are 1500.

So, add it all up: 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 13500.

Now add that to the truck price: 30000 + 13500 = 43500

That's a lotta money for a truck!

$43500

"Well, lemme see... he gets an extra $1000 a month, so that's $21000 a month now. And a bonus of $10000?  That's a lotta money! So, that's $31000 a month. Times 12 months...  carry the one...  that's $372000 for the whole year!

"Okay, so he buys ten of them fancy suits, right? Those cost a lotta money, like seven-fifty each.  So that's, lemme see... seven-fifty times ten... that's seventy-five hundred bucks!

Then he gets ten pairs of pants too. Those are cheaper, only a fifth of the suit price, so that's, uh... one-fifty each. Ten times one-fifty... fifteen hundred bucks for the pants.

And shirts! Three for every suit, so that's thirty shirts total.  Those are sixty bucks a pop, so thirty times sixty... eighteen hundred for the shirts.

Now, add it all up: seventy-five hundred plus fifteen hundred plus eighteen hundred... that's ten thousand eight hundred dollars! Whew!

"Alisa went 12 miles every hour for 4 and a half hours, so she went 12 times 4 and a half, which is 54 miles. Stanley went 10 miles every hour for 2 and a half hours, so he went 10 times 2 and a half, which is 25 miles.  If you add those together, they biked 54 plus 25, which is 79 miles.

"Well, lemme see... He digs dirt twice as fast as that sticky clay stuff. So the dirt'll take him 6 hours, I reckon.  The clay's gonna take him twice as long, so that's 12 hours.  Add 'em up, and it's gonna take him 18 hours to get that well dug.

"
"Well, lemme see... Clara got a good deal on Tuesday, that's for sure! Twenty pomegranates for twenty bucks a pop, and then she saved two dollars too? That's like, thirty-eight dollars less than if she bought them today.  

Those pomegranates are thirty dollars each now, and even with that ten percent off, it's still a lot more than what Clara paid.  

Hmm, lemme do some figurin'...  

It's gotta be, like, a hundred and forty-two dollars more today.


**Answer:** 142 

"
"Well, lemme see... she made 400 bucks on the red ones, and that's half of what she made on the green ones. So the green ones musta brought in 400 times 2, which is 800 bucks.

That means she made 400 plus 800, so 1200 bucks that month.

The next month she did pretty good too, about three-quarters of what she did the first month. So that's 1200 times 3 divided by 4, which is 900 bucks.

Altogether, over those two months, she made 1200 plus 900, so 2100 bucks!

Now, each egg makes two of those, so she needs 48 divided by 2... which is 24 eggs.

A dozen's got 12, so that's 24 divided by 12...  

She needs 2 dozen eggs.

"Man, that's a lotta money for a plane!  So he spends 5 grand a month on the hanger, and then double that on gas, so that's 10 grand.  That's 15 grand a month just to keep the thing!

"Well, lemme see... she cooked the rice for 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so that's 50 minutes.  The beans took half the time of the rice and pork together, so that's 30 plus 50, which is 80, and half of that is 40.  So, all together, it took 30 plus 50 plus 40, which is 120 minutes.

"Hmm, lemme see... so you got them fancy nuts, right?  

Half a pound of almonds is like, five bucks, and a third of a pound of walnuts is another five bucks. So that's ten bucks total for the first mix.

Now the second one, a fifth of a pound of almonds is only two bucks, and the walnuts are still five bucks. That's seven bucks total.

So, the first mix is three bucks more than the second one.

"
"Well, lemme see...  If each sheep has four legs and each goose has two, and there's 70 legs total... hmm...  That's a lotta legs!  And 20 heads...  Gosh, that's a lot of animals!

Let's see... if we had all sheep, that'd be 20 sheep times 4 legs, which is 80 legs.  That's too many!  So we gotta have some geese to bring that number down.

Hmmm...  I reckon there's gotta be 15 sheep.

"That coffee's gotta be good if it's 20% more!  So, it's like... 5 bucks plus a dollar more, right? That's 6 bucks a pound. He needs a pound a day for a week, so that's 7 pounds.  7 times 6 is 42 bucks for the coffee.  And then the donut's 2 bucks. So, 42 plus 2 is... 44 bucks!

So he gives out 407 papers to those two places.  That means he gives out 600 minus 407 to the other place.  

600 minus 407...  that's 193!

"Well, lemme see... He goes to class four times a week, and each class is two hours long. So that's four times two, which is eight hours a week.  And he does that for six weeks, so that's eight times six... which is forty-eight hours total.

If they put it all together, that's a whole lotta money - three hundred and sixty dollars!  If they split it even, each one gets a hundred and twenty bucks.

"Lemme see... he bought seven of them A candies and ten of them B candies. Them A candies cost fifty cents each, so that's three-fifty.

So, 4 plus 4 plus 6... that's 14 bucks!

"Greta made 30 cookies, and Celinda made a whole lotta more, like double! So that's 30 times 2, which is 60 cookies.  That's a lot of cookies!  They ate some, like 10, so they got 30 plus 60, which is 90, then took away 10, so that leaves... 80 cookies!

"Well, lemme see... he's got three hours 'til dinner, right? That's a long time!  But he's gotta do his schoolwork first.  Let's see... math is 20 minutes, readin' is 40, and history is another 20... so that's 80 minutes of homework.

That means she spent 1200 plus 480, which is 1680 bucks total.

If she started with 2400 and spent 1680, she's got 720 left over.

"Okay, so they got 20 people goin' to the movies, right?  That's a lotta folks!  Each one gets two drinks and three snacks. So that's 20 times 2 drinks, which is 40 drinks. And 20 times 3 snacks, which is 60 snacks.  That's a whole lotta munchies!

If each drink and snack costs two bucks, then they spent 100 things times $2, which is $200.

"Well, lemme see... 6 ladies ate 3 dumplings each, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 dumplings.  The fellas ate one more than the ladies, so they ate 4 each. 8 fellas times 4 dumplings is 32 dumplings.  Add those together and you get 50 dumplings.

576
"
"Well, lemme see... he paid 20 bucks just to get in, right? Then it's a dollar fifty a pound, and he got 30 pounds. So that's 1.5 times 30...  carry the one... that's 45 bucks. Plus the 20 to get in, that's 65 bucks total.

Now, if he bought 'em at the store, it's 2.50 a pound. So that's 2.5 times 30...  that's 75 bucks.

So he saved 75 minus 65... that's 10 bucks!

"
"Well, lemme see... they wanted 500 computers, right? And they had $700 for each one. But then the price went up by 10%, so that's like... $70 more for each one. So each computer cost $770.  

Now, if you multiply that by 500 computers... that's a lotta money!  

$385,000 



"
"Lemme see... six eggs is a lotta eggs!  That's gotta be a lot of calories right there.  Cheese is pretty high in calories too, and ham ain't nothin' to sneeze at neither.  

I'd say that omelet is probably around... 770 calories. 


770
"
"Lemme see... six pencils at fifty cents each... that's three dollars.  And eight erasers at a quarter each... that's two dollars.  So that's five dollars total.  If I gave 'em a ten dollar bill, I should get five dollars back.


$5.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... 30 outta 100 get to talk to 'em, that's like, a third. Then only 6 outta them get the job, that's not many. And only 2 outta them take it?  Sounds like a tough job!

"
"Hmm, let me see... She gave away 3 sacks plus 4 sacks, that's 7 sacks.  And each sack has 25 of them kilos, right? So, 7 times 25...  carry the one... that's 175 kilos!


175 

"
"She got 8 boxes this week, and 4 last week.  That's 4 more boxes this week.

"
"Well, lemme see... she taps real fast with her feet, right?  So, when her arms are down, she's tappin' 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, that's a whole lotta tappin'!  That's 550 taps every minute!  She does that for three minutes, so that's...  *counts on fingers*  1650 taps!

Then she raises her arms and slows down, tappin' 200 times with each foot, so that's 400 taps a minute. She does that for two minutes, so that's... *counts on fingers again* 800 taps!

Now, we gotta add those together... 1650 plus 800... *counts on fingers some more*  That's 2450 taps!


2450 

"
"That pothole's a real pain!  If he fixes it himself, he's gotta buy that asphalt stuff, three buckets at 25 bucks a pop, so that's 75 right there. Plus the city's gonna fine him 120 bucks for messin' with the road.  So that's 195 bucks outta his pocket. But if he don't fix it, his car's gonna get messed up, costin' him 450 bucks!  So he saves 255 bucks by doin' it himself.

$255 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... They had a bunch of chairs, right?  Took some to the fix-it guy.  Let's see... 170 big chairs, minus 20... that's 150 left. And the little chairs, 23 minus 13... that's 10.  So, 150 plus 10...  

160 

"
"Well, lemme see... they each got a whole pizza, right? And a pizza's got 12 pieces. So that's 5 pizzas times 12 pieces, which is 60 pieces in all.

Bryce and two buddies ate most of theirs, like, two-thirds of it. That's a lotta pizza!  The other two guys ate three-quarters of theirs.

Hmm, that's a lot of eatin'!  I bet there ain't much left.  Let me count it out...

 

18 

"
"Well, lemme see... that cat's a slow eater, takin' a whole half hour for just nine sausages! That dog, though, he's a real gobbler.  If the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog's done in 20.  So, all together, that's 50 minutes.  Split that in half, and you get 25.

25 

"
"Well, Topher's shoe is mighty big, like a whole lotta inches!  It's 8 feet and 4 inches, so that's gotta be a hundred inches, right?  

Now, his shoe is ten inches longer than nine times the size of Bobby's shoe.  So, if we take away ten inches from Topher's shoe, that's like nine times the size of Bobby's.

A hundred inches minus ten inches is ninety inches.  Then we gotta divide that by nine, and that's ten inches for Bobby's shoe.

"
"Dang, that Hannah sounds like a real handful!  Let's see... she busted a quarter of the student cars, so that's like 64 divided by 4, which is 16 cars.  Each of them has 4 windows, so that's 16 times 4, which is 64 windows.

Then she went and smashed 3/4 of the teacher cars, so that's 3/4 of 32, which is... hmm...  carry the one... 24 cars. Those only have 2 windows each, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.

Altogether, she smashed 64 plus 48 windows, which is... 112 windows!  That's a lot of broken glass!


112 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  She got a whole lotta spools!  Let's see...  Blue ones... that's the light blue and the dark blue, right?  So that's 15 plus 45... that's 60 blue spools.  

Now, how many in total?  15 plus 45 plus 40 plus 50...  that's a lotta countin'!  150!

So, 60 outta 150...  that's like,  uh...  40 percent, I think.


40 

"
"Well, lemme see... 5000 folks lined up, and by lunchtime, two-fifths of 'em voted. That's a lotta folks!  So, 5000 divided by 5 is 1000, and two of them is 2000.

That leaves 3000 folks left. Then, by 4 o'clock, two-thirds of those folks voted.  So, 3000 divided by 3 is 1000, and two of them is 2000.

That means 1000 folks still ain't voted.

1000 

"
"Well, lemme see... he chews 4 a day, right? And a pack has 15. So, that's like... 30 days times 4... that's 120 pieces he needs.  Then you gotta see how many packs fit in that. 120 divided by 15... hmm...  

8 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They need enough for 9 kids wantin' two each, so that's 9 times 2... 18.  And then 6 grown-ups want one each, so that's 6 more.  That's a whole lotta smores, 24 in all!

Each box has enough for 8, and they need 24... so that's 3 boxes, right?


3 

"
"Dora's fifteen, right? Her daddy's way older, like, double her age plus some more.  So that's thirty, plus eight... thirty-eight!  Her momma's a little younger than him, so maybe thirty-four?  

If you add them all up, that's fifteen plus thirty-eight plus thirty-four...  Eighty-seven! 


87 

"
"Well, if they split it four ways, that's like cuttin' it into four pieces. So each one gets five bucks. 


$5 

"
"Lemme see... she got two books that weigh two pounds each, so that's four pounds. Then she got a four pound book and a three pound book.  And her history book is like, double the English one, so that's six pounds.  

So, four plus four plus three plus six...  carry the one... that's seventeen pounds! 


17 

"
"Well, lemme see... A got 20 votes outta 100, right? And B got way more than that, like half again as much. So that's like... 20 plus another 10, so B got 30 votes.  That leaves 70 votes for C.


70 

"
"Boris has a whole lotta apples, a hundred! Beck's got way less, like 23 less.  If Boris gives Beck some, Beck still won't have as many. Boris still got more.

"
"Lemme see... he used 12 ounces for the big ones, 14 for the medium ones, and 4 for the little ones. That's 12 + 14 + 4...  carry the one... that's 30 ounces.

He started with 32, so he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left. 


2 

"
"Clara's got a whole lotta books, twenty of 'em! Steven's got way less, like ten. Alice has a few more than Steven, maybe sixteen. So, Clara's got four more books than Alice.

"
"Well, lemme see...  A gallon of milk is five bucks, and that's two dollars more than a half-gallon. So a half-gallon is three dollars.

Ten gallons would be fifty dollars, right?  'Cause ten times five is fifty.

And sixteen half-gallons... that's sixteen times three, which is... uh... forty-eight dollars.

So all together, that's fifty plus forty-eight...  Ninety-eight dollars!


98 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 50 kids in the class, 10 like bakin', 5 like shootin' hoops... that leaves... uh... 35?  And some of them like music, right?  Twice as many as the basketball folks, so that's 10 more.  So that's 45 gone...  That means 5 like video games.


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... He started with 12 birdies, and scared off a few, like, a third of 'em.  That's gotta be 4, right? So there's 8 left. Then more come along, 20 more!  So now there's a whole bunch, 28!


28 

"
"Well, lemme see... 80 kids in two classes, that's 40 in each class, right?  And 40% are girls... so that's like, a lotta girls.  Hmm... 40 times 40... carry the one... that's 16 girls in each class.  So if there's 40 kids and 16 are girls, the rest gotta be boys.  That's 24 boys in each class.


24 

"
"She had 2, then 5, then a whole bunch, like 15! Then she ate some, and that sneaky friend took some too.  I think she had 8 left.

"
"Well, lemme see... she's gotta groom 28 critters, right? And there's seven days in a week. So, that's like... 28 split up into seven piles.

"
"Alright, so he spent $5400 on them packs of cards, right?  He got two good ones worth a bunch, like $5000 all together. Then he got a bunch more worth $50 each, so that's... lemme see... 30 times 50...  carry the one... that's $1500 more! So all his cards are worth $6500.  

That means he made $1100!


$1100 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So they got two grownups and two little ones, right?

The first place wants 26 bucks for each grownup, so that's 26 times 2, which is 52. Then the kids are 12 bucks each, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24.  Add those together, and that's 52 plus 24, which is 76 bucks.

The second place is cheaper for grownups, 14 bucks each, so that's 14 times 2, which is 28. The kids are 10 bucks each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20. Add those up, and that's 28 plus 20, which is 48 bucks.

So they save 76 minus 48, which is 28 bucks if they go to the second place.


$28 

"
"Well, lemme see... he saves ten cents on every tomato, right?  So that's 500 tomatoes times ten cents...  carry the one... that's fifty bucks a day!  And in a week, that's like... seven days times fifty bucks...  

$350 

"
"Well, lemme see... Sean's got 56, right? And Carl's got four times that, so that's like 56 times 4...  carry the one... that's 224!  And Cal's got double Sean, so he's got 56 times 2, which is 112.  

Now, to get the total, we gotta add Carl's and Cal's marbles together... 224 plus 112...  

336! 


336
"
"Well, if we got 54 kids and we wanna split 'em up into 6 groups, that's 9 kids per group.  But if we need 12 groups, that's a whole lotta more kids!  We need 12 groups times 9 kids each, so that's 108 kids.  We need 54 more kids to make all those groups.

"
"Well, lemme see... she rents out 60 chairs on weekdays, so that's like 60 times 5, which is 300. And on weekends, it's 100 times 2, so that's 200.  So every week she rents out 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs.

Now, a month has about 4 weeks, so that's 500 times 4, which is 2000 chairs a month.

Two months would be 2000 times 2, so that's 4000 chairs.


4000 

"
"That sneaky Arnold!  Let's see... Gunther had 48 bananas, and that monkey took half, so that's 24 gone.  Then Gunther got more, 25 I think?  So that's 24 plus 25... hmm...  That's 49.  But then Arnold took more, 12 this time.  So 49 minus 12...  That's 37.  And Gunther put in 6 more... so 37 plus 6...  

That's 43 bananas!


**Answer:** 43 

"
"Well, lemme see... they split the hundred dollar bill four ways, so that's 25 bucks each every month.  And there's 12 months in a year, so...  carry the one... that's 300 bucks a year each.


$300 

"
"Well, lemme see... He had a whole bunch of glasses, like, eight sets of twelve, right? That's a lotta glasses! And four sets of plates, twelve in each. So that's a lot of plates too.  But then some got busted, ten glasses and six plates.  So, if you take away the broken ones... hmm...  I think he's got, like, eighty-six glasses and forty-two plates left.  That's still a lot!


128 

"
"Okay, so Lorraine has a bunch of stickers, right?  She trades a lotta her little stickers for the big buttons, then some of her big stickers for more big buttons.  Then she trades the rest of her big stickers for more little buttons.  

Let's see... she ends up with a whole lotta buttons!  I counted 'em up and she has 107 buttons.


107 

"
"Well, lemme see... he played two games on Monday, one on Friday, and then on Saturday, he played twice as many as Monday, so that's four more.  

So, two plus one plus four... that's seven games! 


7 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 33 folks votin', right? And the yes votes were double the no votes.  Hmm... that means if we split 'em in half, that's 33 divided by 2, which is 16 and a half.  So, the no votes were 16 and a half, and the yes votes were double that, so... 16 and a half times 2 is 33.

22 

"
"Lemme see... so she needs 11 of the littlest shirts. Then double that for the next size up, so that's 22.  Then 4 less than that, so 18.  Half of them need the next size, so 9. And then 6 more than that for the biggest ones, so 15.

Now, add 'em all up... 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts. 


75 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 5% off of 140 bucks...  That's like, 7 dollars off, right? So it'd be 133 dollars.

"Wow, that's a lotta songs!  Let's see... 20 playlists times 300 songs each... that's a whole bunch!  And each song is 10 hours long?  Man, that's gonna take forever to listen to!

"
"Well, lemme see... 20 outta 50 folks like horse number 2, so that's 10 people.  That leaves 40 folks.  Then 60% of them like horse number 7... so that's... uh... carry the one... 24 people.

That means 16 folks are rootin' for horse number 12!


16 

"
"Well, lemme see... If a third of them fluffy Pomeranians are girls, and there's 6 girl pups, that means there's 6 times 3, which is 18 Pomeranians total.  And if those Pomeranians are two-thirds of all the puppies, then there's gotta be 18 times 3, which is 54 puppies!

"Jayden has some money, and his sister gave him some too.  He wants a camera that costs a lot.  Let's see... he needs $85 more.


$85 

"
"Well, lemme see... they need 250 cases total, right? And the first house gets half of what the second one gets.  The third house gets double the first one.  Hmm... that means the second house must get a good chunk of 'em.  If the third house gets double the first, and they all add up to 250...  I'd say the third house needs 100 cases. 


100 

"
"Lemme see... Leila got 3 cucumbers, and they's 2 dollars each, so that's 6 bucks. Jack got 5 tomatoes at a dollar each, so that's 5 more. And Chase got lettuce for 3 dollars.  

So, 6 plus 5 plus 3... that's 14 dollars all together.


14 

"
"Well, lemme see... George got a whole lotta bananas, 200 of 'em! And he got 45% more pears than that.  Hmm, that's like... almost half again as many pears. So, that's gotta be a bunch more pears, right?  

If he got 200 bananas and then a whole bunch more pears, he's gotta have a whole lotta fruit!  I'd say... maybe close to 500 fruits?

"Marissa had sixty bucks left after buyin' that ball.  Candy bars cost five bucks a pop, so she got Jimmy twelve of 'em.

"
"Well, lemme see...  He needs 5 big bags of oranges for one jug of juice, right? And each bag costs 3 bucks. So if he wants four jugs, that's 20 bags of oranges.  

20 times 3...  carry the one... that's 60 dollars.


$60 

"
"Ezra read a whole lotta books, like 300! And Ahmed, he read half as many, so that's 150.  Ezra read even more, another 150!  So Ezra read 300 plus 150, that's 450 books!  All together, that's 450 plus Ahmed's 150, so they read 600 books!


600 

"
"Well, lemme see... she makes 15 bucks an hour, right?

Monday she worked 5 hours, so that's 15 times 5, which is 75 dollars.

And she taught extra classes that day, so she gets 5 more dollars.

So Monday she made 80 dollars.

Wednesday she only worked 2 hours, so that's 15 times 2, which is 30 dollars.

Altogether, she made 80 plus 30, which is 110 dollars.


110 

"
"They sold a whole lotta vanilla!  They sold 20 of them, but only 16 of the fruity ones. So that's 4 more vanilla.

"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 60 bucks from them eggplants, right?  So he needs to make another 75 bucks from the corn.  That's 25 ears, so he needs to sell each one for 3 bucks a pop.


$3 

"
"Well, lemme see... she's got 7 hours on one day and 5 on the other, so that's 12 hours total.  She reads for 3 of them, so that leaves 9.  Then she plays games for a third of that, which is 3 hours.  That means she's got 6 hours left for soccer.  

So, outta her 12 hours, she spends 6 on soccer.  That's half, right?  So it's 50%.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Anthony had 50 pencils, right? He gave half to Brandon, so that's 25 gone. Then he gave some to Charlie...  Let's see, 3 out of every 5...  That's gotta be... 15 pencils. So he gave away 25 plus 15, which is 40 pencils. That leaves him with... 10 pencils!

"Well, he drives there and back, so that's twice the distance, right?  That's 300 miles.

"Hmm, lemme see... He's got 57 cars and each one needs 4 wheels, so that's... a lot of wheels.  Let's see, 57 times 4...  carry the one... that's 228 wheels.

Now them motorcycles, 73 of 'em, and they only need 2 wheels each. So that's 73 times 2...  that's 146 wheels.

Altogether, that's 228 plus 146...  374 wheels he needs.

He's got 650 wheels in the box, so he's got 650 minus 374...  that's 276 wheels left over.

"Okay, so this guy Mike's got a lotta movies, right?  Six hundred!  A third of 'em are in those sets, like all the Star Wars ones or somethin'.  He gets a deal on those, like a third off, so they're only $6.67 each.  That's 200 movies times $6.67, which is... lemme see...  *scribbles on a napkin*  That's $1334.

Then he's got some old movies, like, 40% of the rest.  Those are only $5 each.  So that's, uh... 400 movies minus the 200, so 200 movies times 40%, which is 80 movies.  80 times $5 is $400.

The rest are regular price, so that's 240 movies times $10, which is $2400.

Now, add it all up: $1334 + $400 + $2400...  *more scribbling*  That's $4134!  Man, that's a lot of money for movies!

"Well, shoot, this sounds tricky!  They get points for jumpin' on bad guys, pickin' up berries, and whatever time they got left. Ava's better at jumpin' and grabbin' stuff, but she takes longer.  

I dunno, it's hard to say who wins without knowin' how many bad guys they jumped on and stuff.  Could go either way!

"Well, lemme see... Bob had 3 orange fishies and 4 white ones. He got a bunch more, 17 to be exact. Now he's got twice as many orange as white.  Hmm... that means he musta got 4 more white ones.

"
"Well, lemme see... he drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home, so that's 10 miles a day.  He does that 5 days a week, so that's 50 miles total.  If his car gets 10 miles to the gallon, he's usin' 5 gallons a week.  Gas is $3 a gallon, so that's 5 times 3...

And she spent most of them, like three outta five, so that's... hmm...  carry the one...  that's a hundred and twenty bucks. Then she had a bunch of quarters, one forty of 'em.  That's like, a quarter's worth twenty-five cents, so that's thirty-five bucks.  

So, she spent a hundred and twenty plus thirty-five... that's a hundred and fifty-five bucks!

"Hmm, lemme see... so they sold 40 TVs in total, right? And some were fancy smart TVs, some were old-school analog ones, and the rest were those new-fangled OLED ones.  They said a quarter were smart TVs, so that's 10. And an eighth were analog, so that's 5.  

If you add those together, that's 15 TVs.  So, they musta sold 25 OLED TVs.

"Brrr, it gets mighty cold at night! If it's 12 degrees when the sun goes down, and them pipes freeze at 32, that's a whole 20 degrees colder it needs to be.  Each log warms things up by 5, so he'd need 4 logs to keep them pipes from bustin'.

"Well, lemme see... they had 90 folks, and they made groups of 9. So that's 10 groups, right?  Some of them brought back seashells, I think it was 3 outta every 5 groups.

"Well, lemme see... he finds 10 of them things a day, and each one's worth a quarter, right? So that's like 2 bucks and 50 cents every day.  Now, if he does that for a whole month, which is 30 days, that's... hmm... carry the one...  

$75.00 

"
"Well, she makes 20 bucks an hour, right? And she worked 8 hours, so that's 20 times 8, which is 160 dollars.  Then she worked 3 more hours, so that's 3 times 20, which is 60 more dollars.  But wait, those extra hours are paid more, right?  It's like, 150% more, so that's like... 20 times 1.5, which is 30 bucks an hour. So those extra 3 hours are 3 times 30, which is 90 dollars.

So, all together, she made 160 plus 90, which is 250 dollars.

"
"Lemme see...  She's got a bunch of lady lions, twelve of 'em.  Then half as many boy lions, so that's six. And a whole passel of cubs, fourteen little ones.  

Add 'em all up... twelve plus six plus fourteen... that's thirty-two lions!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... them jeans are forty bucks, but they's on sale for a quarter off.  So that's ten bucks off, right?  That makes 'em thirty bucks.  If he pays with a fifty, he'll have twenty bucks left over.


$20.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... they start with 200 folks, right? And they add 20 more each month, so after three months, that's 20 times 3, which is 60 more people.  So now they got 200 plus 60, that's 260 people workin' there.

Each one gets 4000 bucks a month, so that's 260 times 4000...  carry the one...  that's a lotta money, 1,040,000 dollars!

1040000 

"
"Well, lemme see... they sing that ""Deck the Halls"" one twice, so that's gotta be... hmm... 150 and 150... that's 300.  And then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is 240. So, 300 plus 240...  

540 

"
"Billy makes $11.50 an hour now, 'cause he got a couple raises. Sally makes $10.50.  If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $230 and Sally makes $210. So Billy makes $20 more.

"
"Three loafs of bread cost six bucks, 'cause they's two dollars each. Two bagels is two dollars. So, three loafs cost four dollars more than two bagels.

"Pierson got a lotta points, 278! Nikita did pretty good too.  Half of Pierson's score is like, 139, and then Nikita got 11 more than that, so that's 150.  If you add them together, they got 428 points!


428 

"
"Gosh, that's a lot of trees!  Let's see... forty classes times twenty-five kids... that's a whole lotta kids plantin' trees!  And three teachers per class, so that's a bunch more trees too.  Hmm, if each kid plants one and each teacher plants two...  

*counts on fingers*

I think they'll plant...  a whole bunch!  Maybe over a thousand? 


1240 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she's got a bunch of stuffies, right? Puppies, koalas, zebras, and frogs... that's a lotta animals!  If she wants goats to be 30% of 'em, she needs...  I dunno, maybe like 4 or 5 more? Gotta be a whole number, can't have half a goat!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she plays a half hour every day for two weeks, that's like, fourteen days, right? So that's seven hours. Then she plays two hours a day for another week, so that's another fourteen hours.  That's twenty-one hours total. She needs thirty, so she still needs... nine more hours.

"
"Well, that there second car's goin' faster, so it's gonna be ahead.  It's goin' 10 miles faster every hour, so in two hours, it'll be 20 miles ahead.

"That ring cost a pretty penny!  The diamond was six hundred bucks and the gold was three hundred.  So that's nine hundred already.  But then they tacked on another three hundred for makin' it fancy.  So, all together, it was eleven seventy.


$1170 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 340 outta 500 third graders passin', and 40 outta 100 fourth graders.  Then them fifth graders, they did twice as good as the fourth graders, so that's 80 outta 100 passin'.  

So, that's 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 kids passin' outta 1000 total.

That means 70% passed. 


70
"
"Well, lemme see... he's got 72 chips in each bag, and two bags, so that's 72 times 2, which is 144 chips.  He needs 12 chips for every inch, and his mosaic is gonna be 3 inches tall. So, 144 chips divided by 12 chips per inch is... 12 inches!  

12 

"
"Well, lemme see... they had 10 quarts left, and them four kids drank a quart and a half each, so that's 6 quarts gone. Then them other 16 kids drank 2 quarts each, so that's 32 quarts!  

That's 38 quarts they drank in all. So they musta started with 48 quarts, 'cause 38 plus 10 is 48.

Now, how many gallons is that?  Hmm, I know there's 4 quarts in a gallon... so 48 divided by 4... that's 12 gallons!


12 

"
"Well, lemme see... He had a hundred, sold a bunch more, then got another hundred.  That's two hundred candies total, right?  He sold a hundred and fifty, so he's gotta sell fifty more.


50 

"
"Well, if they start with 10 and double every month, that's a lot of growin'!  Let's see... double 10 is 20, then double that is 40, then 80, then 160, and then 320!  

That's a whole lotta new folks!  

310 

"
"Well, if he makes 25 cents for each branch he climbs and he made a whole $105, that's a lotta branches!  He musta climbed 420 branches that week. If he worked 5 days, that's like 84 branches a day.

84 

"
"Lemme see... she picked a whole bunch of flowers, right?  

* First, she got 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so that's 3 times 5... which is 15 petals.
* Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals, so that's 4 times 6... which is 24 petals.
* Then 5 flowers with 4 petals, so 5 times 4... that's 20 petals.
* And lastly, 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so 6 times 7... that's 42 petals.

Now, she dropped one of each kind, so that's 5 petals gone.

So, she had 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals, but lost 5, so that leaves her with 96 petals.


96 

"
"They made a whole lotta s'mores!  Let's see... they used up a bunch of marshmallows, and dropped some too.  Hmm...  I reckon they got 'bout 7 s'mores each outta what's left.

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for a long time, 20 minutes for a quarter. His buddies who ain't so good, they only get half that, so 10 minutes. The good one, he gets more time, like 30 minutes.

They play for a whole 4 hours, that's a lot!  So, gotta figure out how many quarters each guy needs.

Jack needs 12 quarters, the bad guys each need 24, so that's 48 quarters for them. The good guy needs 8.

Add it all up, 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Now, each quarter is 25 cents, so 68 times 25 cents is... lemme see...  $17.00!

$17.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... she uses the same amount of that fancy smell stuff and the lemon peel thingy. And the salt and sugar are the same too.  She uses double the oil as salt, and double the salt as the lemon peel.  

So, if we think of the lemon peel as one, the salt is two, the oil is four, and the sugar is two too. That's ten in total, so she uses four ounces of oil.


4 

"
"Lemme see... he bought three goats at five hundred bucks a pop, so that's fifteen hundred right there. Then two cows at fifteen hundred each, so that's another three thousand.  

Fifteen hundred plus three thousand...  carry the one... that's four thousand five hundred dollars!


$4500 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He needs 63 cupcakes, right? And he's got 8 chocolate ones and 40 of them toffee things.  So that's... 48 cupcakes he already has.  

63 minus 48...  That's 15 more cupcakes he needs to get.


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... Joe's got double the cars Robert has, and Robert's got 20. So Joe's got 40 cars. Then he sells some, like a fifth of 'em, that's 8 cars gone.  And then he gives his mama double that, so that's 16 more gone.  

So, 40 minus 8, that's 32. Then take away another 16, and Joe's got 16 cars left.


16 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got 175,000 bucks total, and them big shots gave 50,000. So that leaves 125,000 for the kids, right?  

If 20 kids split that, each one gets...  6,250 dollars! 


$6,250
"
"Well, lemme see... she walked for 8 hours one day, and half of that the next, so that's 4 more hours.  That's 12 hours total.  Now, there's 60 minutes in an hour, so 12 times 60...  

720 

"
"Well, lemme see... He started with 50 cars, then saw 20 more, so that's 50 plus 20, which is 70 cars.  Then half of them left, so that's 70 divided by 2... which is 35 cars. 


35 

"
"Well, lemme see... he does 30 of them things a day, and each one has 5 little jobs, right?  And each little job pays a buck twenty. So that's 30 times 5, which is 150... then times the buck twenty...  carry the one... that's 180 bucks a day.

Now, a week is 7 days, so 180 times 7...  that's 1260 bucks!


$1260.00

"Sasha scored 14 points the first time. Then she scored 4 less the second time, so that's 10 points.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 8 packs of cat food, 11 in each... that's a lotta cat food!  So that's 8 times 11...  88 tins!  Dog food is 6 packs times 6 tins... 36 tins.  

88 minus 36...  that's 52 more tins of cat food.


52 

"
"Okay, so they got a whole bunch of cards, right?  PJ's got some, Smendrick's got three times that, and Becca's got even more than Smendrick.  All together they got 341 cards.  Hmm... lemme see...  

If Smendrick's got three times PJ's cards, and Becca's got more than Smendrick... Becca must have a lot!  

Let's see...  

*PJ's got some, Smendrick's got three times that, and Becca's got even more...*

I dunno, maybe Becca's got like... 153 cards?

"
"Let's see... she had 5 green ones, and then double that in blue, so that's 10.  Then she had one less pink than blue, so that's 9. And then a third of the pink ones were yellow, so that's 3.  

If you add 'em all up, 5 plus 10 plus 9 plus 3... that's 27 eggs!

"That book cost me 32 bucks, and they only give back 24.  Then they charge me 3 dollars to send it back.  So I'm out 5 bucks.

"Mulan had some money, then her daddy gave her more. She bought some pants and a bag.  Let's see... she had forty, then a hundred more, so that's a hundred and forty. The pants cost thirty each, and she got two, so that's sixty.  Plus the bag, twenty... eighty dollars gone.  That leaves her with sixty dollars.


$60 

"
"Well, lemme see... He makes 50,000 a month, right? First week's 8,000. Second week's half of that, so that's 4,000. Third week's a whole lotta more, three times the first week, so that's 24,000!  

That's 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000.

So he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 more in the last week.

14000 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she makes a lotta TikToks, like, a bunch every week. And she sings too, that takes time. Plus, she puts on makeup before each one.  

Let's see... 18 TikToks times 4 minutes each... that's a lot of minutes! And then the makeup, that's like, an hour and a half every week.  

Gosh, that's a lot of time on TikTok! I bet it's like, almost 20 hours a month.

"
"Okay, so they charge ya $129 to hang a few things, right?  She's got extra mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures though.  Let's see... two extra mirrors is 30 bucks, one extra chandelier is 15 more, and ten extra pictures is 150 bucks.  Add that all up with the first price...  

$129 + $30 + $15 + $150 = $324.00 


$324.00
"
"Anthony has $30, 'cause he has $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20. Roy has more than Anthony, like, way more.  Anthony has $30, and Roy has 40% more than that.  Hmm, 40% of 30 is... lemme see... that's like a third, right? So that's $10 more.  So Roy has $30 plus $10, which is $40.

"Naruto's real strong, man! He can lift a mountain way higher than that Kagiyami fella. Kagiyami can lift one them mountains, like, four times higher than Saskay, and Saskay can lift one way higher than Pompei. Pompei can only lift a little one, just an inch.  

So, Naruto, he's like, ten times stronger than Kagiyami. That means he can lift a mountain, like, forty feet high!

"
"Well, he goes 8 miles every hour, right? So in 4 hours, that's 8 times 4, which is 32 miles. Then he goes another 6 hours, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 miles.  

Now, you add those together, 32 plus 48...

"
"Well, if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo takes a whole lot longer, right?  Like, three times as long, so 54 hours.

Now, turtles are slow, like half as fast as a kangaroo. So, four turtles would be like havin' two kangaroos, but still way slower.

I reckon it'd take them a good long while, maybe like... 27 hours?

"Well, lemme see... Kora made 20, and Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 40.  Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 80.  If you add 'em all up, that's 20 + 40 + 80...

"Hmm, lemme see... so they got three glue sticks, right?  And some is used up.  One's got a little left, one's got more left, and one's got half left.  If they was all full, they'd be 12 long.  So, gotta figure out how much ain't used up...

Let's see... 

* First one, 5 outta 6 is left, so that's 10.
* Second one, 1 outta 3 is left, so that's 4.
* Third one, half is left, so that's 6.

Add those up... 10 + 4 + 6... that's 20!

So he spent twelve plus nine, which is twenty-one bucks.  Forty minus twenty-one... that's nineteen dollars left.


$19 

"
"Well, lemme see... Jack got 60 dishes, right? And that's twice the socks he got, so he musta got 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter's got double the socks Jack has, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 socks for Peter.

Peter's dishes are half of Jack's, so he's got 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they got 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they got 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes all together.


180 

"
"Well, lemme see... 20 kids in the class... 5 are good at just math, and 8 are good at just English.  So that's 5 plus 8, which is 13.  That leaves 7 kids who must be good at both, right?  So, 5 who are good at just math plus 7 who are good at both... that's 12 kids good at math!

"
"Well, lemme see... Two hours is a long time, that's like, 120 minutes, right?  Each group needs 10 minutes, so...  I guess you could fit 11 groups in there.

"Well, lemme see... she puts in $300, right? And every year she gets three-quarters of that back, so that's like $225 extra each year.  So after one year she has $525. Then another $225 the next year, so that's $750. And then another $225, makin' it $975.


$975

"Hmm, lemme see...  They got lotsa shirts, some white, some with flowers.  Half the white ones got collars, and some of the flower ones got buttons.  

They want to know 'bout the ones without buttons and collars...  

Let's see...  If half the white ones got collars, that means half don't. So that's 20 white ones without collars.

And they said 20 flower shirts got buttons, so the rest don't. That's 30 flower shirts without buttons.

So, 30 flower shirts without buttons minus 20 white shirts without collars... that's 10 more flower shirts.

"Well, lemme see... he's got a whole lotta eggs there!  Thirty eggs fit on each tray, so that's 30 trays full.  If he sells each tray for two-fifty, that's... hmm... carry the one...

"Well, lemme see... He had 55 on one farm and 45 on the other, so that's a whole lotta goats! He sold some from each farm, 10 from one and, uh, double that from the other, so 20.  

So, he had 55 minus 10, which is 45 goats left on one farm. And on the other farm, he had 45 minus 20, which is 25 goats left.

Now, if you add those together, 45 plus 25, you get 70 goats.

"
"Well, lemme see... He buys two shoes every month, right? And that's like, 2 times 12, so 24 shoes a year.  If he spends 2640 bucks on all them shoes, then each pair costs... hmm...  2640 divided by 24...  That's 110 bucks a pair!

"Lemme see... three green baskets is 3 times 25 bucks, so that's 75 bucks.  Red ones are 18 each, but they's givin' ya 2 bucks off each one. So that's 16 bucks a basket. Three of them is 16 times 3, which is 48 bucks.  

Now, add the green and red together... 75 plus 48... that's 123 bucks.


$123
"
"Well, lemme see...  They got 90 rooms, and they wanna clean half, so that's 45 rooms.  Each room takes 20 minutes, so that's 45 times 20...  carry the one... that's 900 minutes.  Now, there's 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is... 15 hours.

"
"Well, lemme see... they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build a whole bunch more the next year, like three times as many, so that's 12 times 3, which is... 36!  

So that's 12 plus 36, which is 48 houses. Then the next year they double that, so that's 48 times 2... which is 96.

So all together, they build 48 plus 96, which is 144 houses.

"Well, lemme see...  

If I'm three years younger than my brother, and two years older than my sister, that's gotta be a good chunk of years right there. And my momma, she's older than all of us, 'bout three times my brother's age, minus one year.

"Well, lemme see... if ten folks got it, and each one gives it to six more... that's a whole lotta folks!

"Well, lemme see... she bakes two breads every hour, right? And she bakes for five hours, so that's two times five, which is ten breads.

"Hmm, lemme see... they got 12 red ones, and 2 less green ones... so that's 10 green.  Then they got 3 times the green ones in blue... so 30 blue ones.  That's a lotta cars!  12 plus 10 plus 30 is 52.  

If they got 75 in total, then they must have 23 yellow ones.

"Well, if they spend $400 a month, and Madeline pays most of it, that means Keenan pays the rest.  So, it's like $400 split in half, and then some more for Madeline.  That's gotta be, like, $200 for Keenan, right?  And since there are four weeks in a month, he spends $200 / 4 = $50 a week.

"Lemme see... he's got twelve dollars and some change, right?  And them bolts are real cheap, only three cents each.  So, sixteen of them... that's, uh...  carry the one...  that's forty-eight cents.  

So he spends forty-eight cents, and he had twelve dollars...  That leaves him with... twelve dollars. 


$12.00 

"
"Well, she makes $33 for 3 hours, so that's like $11 every hour, right?  If she walks dogs for a whole 12 hours, she'd make $11 times 12... lemme see... that's $132!

"Paul had a bunch of marbles, then got more.  Then he lost some.  Hmm, lemme see... 52 plus 28 is 80.  Then he lost a quarter of them... that's like cutting the 80 in fourths, so he lost 20.  So he has 60 left.

"
"Okay, so she gets most of the easy ones right, like the ones with just two choices.  She's pretty good at the true or false ones too.  The long ones are harder, but she still gets some of those.  Let's see...

She gets 8 of the first ones right, that's 8 points.

Then 18 of the true or false ones, so that's 18 more points.

And 3 of the hard ones, so that's 15 points.

Add 'em all up... 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points!

"
"Well, lemme see... he wants to make 2000 bucks, right? And he's sellin' them chickens for 50 bucks a pop.  He's got a whole lotta chickens, 300, but he's only sellin' some of 'em, like 180 of 'em. So, that's 180 times 50...  carry the one... that's 9000 bucks he'll make. But he wants to make 2000 on top of what he paid for 'em, so he musta paid 7000 for all them chickens.

"Julie sold a whole lotta lemonade, like 14 cups! Them boys sold the rest, and they split it even.  So if they sold 32 cups all together, and Julie sold 14, that means the boys sold 18 cups.  

Each boy sold 9 cups, 'cause 18 split in half is 9.  Julie sold 5 more cups than Micah, 'cause 14 minus 9 is 5.

"
"Well, lemme see... she spent 400 on her hair, that's a lot! Then a fourth of that on her nails, so that's 100 bucks. And then three-fourths of the nail price on her toes, so that's... hmm... 75 bucks.  

So, all together, it's 400 plus 100 plus 75... that's 575 dollars! 


575
"
"Well, lemme see... she gets 20 times 2 dollars, that's 40 bucks. Then she spends 20 times 1.50, so that's 30 bucks.  

40 minus 30 is 10.

$10 

"
"Well, she's gonna be 18 in 10 years, so she's 8 now.  That means when she's 24, it'll be three times her age now.  So, 24 minus 8 is... 16 years!

"
"Lemme see... she got 5 packs of bacon for 10 bucks, so each pack is 2 dollars.  Chicken is double the bacon, so that's 4 bucks a pack. She got 6 of them, so that's 24 bucks. Strawberries are 4 bucks a pop, and she got 3, so that's 12 bucks. Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're 2 bucks each. She got 7 of those, so that's 14 bucks.

Altogether, that's 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 bucks.

If she had 65 bucks, she got 5 bucks left.

"Hmm, lemme see... they make a whole lotta chimichangas!  

125 on Tuesday, 125 on Wednesday... that's 250 already.

And then on Friday, they make double, so that's 250 times 2... which is 500!

So, 250 plus 250 is 500 chimichangas! 


500 

"
"Well, lemme see... He's got 50 of them fancy talkin' things, right? And a fifth of 'em don't fit.  That's like, 10 of 'em, I reckon. So he's got 40 left.

"Hmm, let me see...  Mrs. Smith has a whole lotta plants! A quarter of 'em are inside, so that's like 25, right?  That leaves 75 plants left.  Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's... lemme see... 50 plants.  That means the rest, 25 plants, must be the flowery ones.  So, 25 outta 100 are flowery.  That's a quarter, which is... 25%!

"Well, lemme see... she buys two carrots, a salad for six bucks, and a yogurt. Yogurt's half the price of the salad, so that's three dollars.  That's nine dollars for the salad and yogurt together.

"Carl's a big fella, 16 more kilos than Martin. Christian's even bigger, 8 more than Carl. Harry's a bit smaller than Christian though, 5 kilos less. So Harry's gotta be... 74 kilos.

"Well, lemme see... he rents it out ten times a month, right? And each time it's three hours, so that's thirty hours total.  If he gets twenty-five bucks an hour, that's... thirty times twenty-five...  carry the one... that's seven hundred and fifty dollars! But he gotta pay five hundred for the car, so he makes... two hundred and fifty dollars profit.

For the big masks, she uses 2 and a quarter yards for 3 masks.  That's, uh, 0.75 yards per big mask. She needs 8 big ones, so that's 8 times 0.75, which is 6 yards.

Altogether, she needs 10 yards plus 6 yards, so that's 16 yards.

14 

"
"Well, lemme see... Duncan's 60 now, so eight years ago he was 52.  That's twice as old as Adam was four years ago, so Adam was 26 then.  That means Adam's 30 now.  In eight more years, he'll be 38.

"Well, lemme see... Farmer Brown's got 200 acres, right? And Smith's got, what'd ya say, twice that plus a hundred more?  So that's 200 times 2... which is 400... and then add another hundred... that's 500 acres for Smith.

Now, add 'em up... 200 plus 500... that's 700 acres all together.


700 

"
"Well, lemme see... he makes 20 cents for each thingy he puts in a box, right? And he does, like, 40 of them each hour 'cause he don't do as many as the other guys. So that's 40 times 20 cents, which is 8 bucks an hour.  If he works all day, that's 8 hours times 8 bucks, so...

$64.00

"Well, lemme see... he drinks one every half hour, right? And that hard sudoku takes him, what was it, an hour and a half times four?  So that's like, three hours.  If he drinks one every half hour, that's... six bottles, I think.

"Hmm, lemme see...  He threw a lotta bologna, that Benny!  

So, he used 2 pieces for each red one, and he had 20 red ones. That's 2 times 20, which is 40 pieces of bologna right there.

He used 58 pieces total, so that means he used 58 minus 40, which is 18 pieces for the yellow ones.

If he used 3 pieces for each yellow one, then he had 18 divided by 3, which is 6 yellow balloons.

"Well, he drives a hundred miles a day, and a month has thirty days, so that's three hundred miles a month, right?  He needs a tune-up every thousand miles, so... lemme see...  carry the one...

They made eighty cents for each one, so... hmm...  carry the one...  that's two hundred and forty bucks! But they had to buy 'em first, right?  Fifty cents each... so three hundred lollipops times fifty cents... that's a hundred and fifty bucks.

So, two forty minus a hundred and fifty... that's ninety bucks!

"
"Lemme see... he's got 3 kitties, and 3 times that many pups, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 pups.  Then he's got 2 less bunnies than pups, so that's 9 minus 2, which is 7 bunnies.  Fish are tricky, he's got 3 times the bunnies in fish, so that's 7 times 3, which is 21 fishies.  And then them gerbils, he's got 1/3 the number of fishies as gerbils, so that's 21 divided by 3, which is 7 gerbils.

So, add 'em all up: 3 kitties + 9 pups + 7 bunnies + 21 fishies + 7 gerbils... that's a whole lotta pets!  47!

"Well, Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats a whole lot more, like double! So that's 2 times 2, which is 4 slices. Together they eat 2 plus 4, so that's 6 slices every day.

"Let's see... he bakes a whole lotta those little rolls and muffins.  Those big cinnamon rolls are mighty calorie-heavy, so the little ones gotta be smaller.  And them blueberry muffins, they ain't no slouches neither.  

Hmm, if you cut the calories of the big ones by thirds, that's gonna be a lot less.  Gotta multiply all them little guys by their calories... then add it all up.  

I reckon it's a whole heap of calories, probably 'round... 85,000.


85000 

"
"Well, lemme see... she got 39 on Monday, then double that on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 times 2, which is 78, and then 78 again, so that's 156.  Then she got 48 on Thursday and 57 on Friday.  

Let's add it all up: 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.

Now, there are 5 days, so we gotta split that 300 by 5.  That's 60.

"Well, lemme see... that bus was movin' pretty fast!  If it goes 60 miles every hour for 5 hours, that's like... 60 times 5...  300 miles!

That car was slower, goin' 30 miles an hour for 8 hours. So that's 30 times 8... 240 miles.

The bus went 300 and the car went 240... so the bus went 60 miles farther.

"Hmm, let's see... She had a bunch of toys, right?  Thirty-one blocks, eight fuzzy things, and nine rings... that's a lotta toys already!  She got more toys, and now she has sixty-two.  So, if we take away the ones she already had...

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so they're all together 100 years old, right? And Paul's older than John by 10 years.  Peter's age is just Paul and John's ages added up.  

That means if we take away 10 years from Paul, he's the same age as John.  So, if we add Paul and John's ages together, it's like adding John's age to John's age plus 10. That's double John's age plus 10.

Peter's age is that, so it's gotta be double John's age plus 10.  

Now, if all three are 100 years old together, we gotta figure out what John's age is, then double it and add 10.  That'll tell us how old Peter is.

"
"Let's see... Maria gave her friends 2 balloons each, and she had one. So that's 2+2+2+2+1... that's 9 balloons. Then her momma gave them each 3 more... so that's 3+3+3+3+3... that's 15 more.  

9 + 15 = 24 balloons!

"Lemme see... they got 10 folks givin' 5 boxes each, so that's 50 boxes right there. Plus they got 10 more, so that's 60 boxes total.  If each table holds 2 boxes, they need 30 tables.  They already got 15, so they gotta get 15 more.

"Well, lemme see... that Widgeteer thing makes a whole lotta widgets, like 60 every hour! And the other one, the WidgetMaster, only does 45.  If it runs all day and night for a whole month, that's a lot of widgets!  

The Widgeteer would make way more money 'cause it makes more stuff.  Each widget sells for 6 bucks, so the more you make, the more you get.  I bet it'd be a whole lotta more, like maybe... 60,000 dollars more?


64800

"Hmm, lemme see... so he stays for, like, almost a whole day, right?  That 24-hour thing costs 1600 pesos. But if he pays by the hour after 12, it's 1000 pesos plus...  5 extra hours times 70 pesos each... that's 350 more. So it's 1000 plus 350, which is 1350 pesos.

He saves 1600 minus 1350... that's 250 pesos!

"Well, lemme see... them goats eat 5 pounds each, and that's a whole lotta goats, fifteen of 'em! So that's 15 times 5, which is... uh... 75 pounds. Them sheep, they're a bit trickier. They eat less than the goats, somethin' like... hmm... twice what a goat eats, but then take away 3 pounds. So that's... 10 pounds?  Nah, lemme do it right... twice 5 is 10, then take away 3... that's 7 pounds for each sheep.  And there's 12 of 'em, so that's 12 times 7... which is... 84 pounds.

Now, add up the goat hay and the sheep hay... 75 plus 84... that's 159 pounds!

"
"Well, lemme see... He makes 50 bucks an hour and worked 6 hours, so that's 50 times 6...  300 dollars!  Then he spends 50 on gas, so he's got 250 left.  Those pencils cost 10 each, and he buys 5, so that's 50 bucks gone. Now he's got 200.  He puts 100 in the bank, so he's got 100 left.  Those pens are 25 bucks a pop, so he can buy... 4 of them!

"Lemme see... Craig spelled a whole bunch of big words, twenty of 'em, and each one had fifteen letters. So that's, uh... twenty times fifteen...  carry the one... that's three hundred letters! His brother did even better, though, fifty more letters than that. So that's three hundred plus fifty... three fifty!  

Now, to get the total, we gotta add Craig's letters to his brother's. Three hundred plus three fifty... that's six hundred and fifty letters!

"Well, lemme see... they got 8 kids in a line, and 7 lines of kids for each school.  And there's 5 schools. So that's 8 times 7, which is 56 kids for each school. Then you gotta do 56 times 5, which is... hmm... lemme count on my fingers...

So, she got nine hundred minus fifty-eight...  That's a lot of bottles left over for the teacher!

"Lemme see... forty bucks to show up, plus thirty-five for each hour, and she worked for two and a quarter hours... so that's seventy-eight seventy-five.  Then there's the parts, sixty bucks.  So, uh...

He sold five of 'em for forty bucks a pop.  That's two hundred bucks!  But he still had to pay for the ones he kept.

"Lemme see... she got six yams at a dollar fifty each, so that's nine bucks. Ten sweet potatoes at two bucks a pop, that's twenty. And four carrots at a dollar twenty-five, so that's five bucks.

Now he's gotta go 8 more miles, but he's tired, so he's slower.  He only goes 1 mile an hour now. So that's another 8 hours of swimmin'.

"Well, lemme see... that little Aliya is 3, right? And Shawna's three times older than her, so Shawna's gotta be 9.  Shawna's daddy's five times older than her, so he's... hmm... carry the one...  that's 45!


45 

"
"Well, Courtney ain't too good with numbers, that's for sure.  If she said there were 48 folks there, and Kelly says she's off by 20%, that means she counted too many.  So, gotta take some away... lemme see... 20% of 48... hmm... that's like, almost 10, right?  So maybe there were around 38 people there. 


38 

"
"Well, lemme see... Jason had 2 balls.  Jeffrey had less, so maybe just 1? And Jordan had more than Jason, so maybe 4?  That's 1 plus 2 plus 4...

"
"Well, they dug a whole bunch of holes, see?  First day ten, then thirteen, then eight more. But they filled in two 'cause they kept fallin' in! So that's, uh... lemme see... thirty-one minus two... twenty-nine holes.

The map said there was four times as many holes by the time they found the treasure as there was on the first day.  So, twenty-nine holes is four times what they dug the first day. That means they dug... seven holes the first day.

So, they dug twenty-two holes on the fourth day! 


22 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So Amora and Lainey got 70 chips each, right? And Collins got more, like 15 extra. So that's 70 plus 15, which is 85 for Collins.

Now, to get the total, we gotta add 'em all up: 70 plus 70 plus 85.  That's 225 chips in total!


225 

"
"Well, lemme see...  He spent $400 on stuff, and the tickets cost half again as much, so that's like... another $200.  So the tickets cost $600.


$600
"
"Okay, so they caught a whole bunch of Pokemon, right?  339 of 'em!  

Alex got more than Stan, and Stan got way less than that Adelwolfe fella.  

Hmm... lemme see... if Stan got less than four times what Adelwolfe got, and Alex got more than Stan...  

*counts on fingers*

Stan musta caught... 147 Pokemon! 



"
"Well, lemme see...  Each show is 20 minutes long, and there's 10 of 'em. So that's 20 times 10...  

200 

"
"Well, lemme see... she flew south for a right long time, ten hours at 30 miles an hour, so that's...  300 miles, I reckon. Then she flew back north for a bit, two hours at 18 miles an hour, so that's 36 miles.  Then south again for 5 hours at 22 miles an hour, so that's... 110 miles.

So, 300 minus 36 plus 110... that's 374 miles.


374 

"
"Well, lemme see... she made 12 brownies, then got 6 more, and her friends had a whole bunch, like 48!  That's a lotta brownies!  So that's 12 plus 6 plus 48... hmm... carry the one... that's 66 brownies!  But they ate some, like 18.  So 66 minus 18...  that's 48 brownies left.


48 

"
"Well, Nani's 8, right? And his brother's twice that, so he's 16.  His sister's a bit younger, like 6 I think. So, 8 plus 16 plus 6... that's 30!


30 

"
"Lemme see... he's got a lotta racquets to do!  

Three with that fancy synthetic stuff, that's 3 times 15 minutes... so 45 minutes.

Then five with the polyester, that's 5 times 22 minutes...  that's 110 minutes.

And four of them are mixed, so that's 4 times 18 minutes... 72 minutes.

Now, add it all up... 45 plus 110 plus 72... that's 227 minutes.

227 

"
"Okay, so he buys two phones at full price, that's 600 times 2, so 1200 bucks. Then the other two are half price, so 600 divided by 2 is 300 each.  That's 300 times 2, so 600 more.  

1200 plus 600 is 1800.

$1800 

"
"Zeke's team has more guys, right?  Carlton's got 13, and Zeke's got 7 more than that... so Zeke's got 20.  

If you add 'em all up, that's 13 plus 20...  

33 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got a fence that's 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so that's gotta be a whole lotta feet all the way around.  He needs two of them slats for every foot, so... hmm...  

Let's see... 15 plus 10 is 25, and then times that by 2...  

That's 50 feet all the way around.

So he needs 50 times 2... which is 100 slats.


100 

"
"Well, lemme see... she had 12 boxes, gave away 4, so that leaves her with 8. She keeps 2, so she sells 6 boxes.  If each box has 20 oranges, that's 6 times 20...  

120 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... America's got a whole lotta states, like, fifty or somethin'. India, they got, uh, less.  But they got more than half of what America has.  So, if America's got fifty, that's like twenty-five, right? And India's got four more than that... so that's twenty-nine.  

Now, if you add those together... fifty plus twenty-nine... that's seventy-nine!


79 

"
"Lemme see... he needs 39 bucks for all them books, and he only got 14.  So that's 25 more dollars he needs. If he makes 5 bucks an hour, he gotta work 5 hours.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Robert's got a whole bunch o' cherries, 30! And Richard's got 10 less than him, so that's 20.  That leaves 10 for Jerry.  Robert's got 20 more cherries than Jerry.


20 

"
"Okay, so Sunny sold them gingerbread things and apple pies, right?  

On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread.  He sold less apple pies, 4 less than the gingerbread. So that's 6 apple pies.

Gingerbread cost 6 bucks a box, so that's 60 bucks. Apple pies are 15 bucks a box, so that's 90 bucks.

On Sunday, he sold more gingerbread, 5 more than Saturday, so that's 15 gingerbread. And he sold 15 apple pies.

So, gingerbread on Sunday is 15 times 6, which is 90 bucks. Apple pies are 15 times 15, which is 225 bucks.

Saturday he made 150 bucks (60 + 90). Sunday he made 315 bucks (90 + 225).

So, both days he made 465 bucks (150 + 315).

 
$465 

"
"Well, she needs a ounce every hour, and she's out there for 4 hours, so that's 4 ounces a day, right?  And she's gone for 8 days, so that's 4 times 8... lemme see... 32 ounces!  Those bottles have 8 ounces, so she'll need 4 of them.

"
"That blue car's a hundred bucks, huh?  The red one's cheaper, like, way cheaper.  They said forty percent off.  Hmm... lemme see... forty percent of a hundred... that's like, forty dollars off. So the red one's sixty bucks.  

Altogether, that's a hundred plus sixty...  

$160 

"
"Well, lemme see... Emil's gonna be 24, and that's half his dad's age, so his dad's gonna be 48.  And Emil's gonna be twice as old as his little brother, so the brother's gonna be 12.  

Now, Emil's dad is 43 now, 'cause 48 minus 5 is 43. And the little brother's 7 now, 'cause 12 minus 5 is 7.

So, 43 plus 7 is... 50.

"
"Let's see... Mama gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her some more, 10 more than Mama, so that's 20 plus 10, which is 30.  Her friend gave her a whole bunch, twice what Mama gave her, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40.  Now we gotta add 'em all up: 20 plus 30 plus 40...  

90 

"
"Well, lemme see... he caught 3 pounds one day, then 4 times that the next, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 pounds. Then half of that on Saturday, so 12 divided by 2 is 6.  That's 3 + 12 + 6, which is 21 pounds total.  If each serving is 3 pounds, he's got 21 divided by 3, which is 7 servings.

"
"Well, lemme see... 20 outta 30 kids play football, so that's a good chunk.  Then, a quarter of the rest are doin' cheer or band.  So, that's like... 6 more kids, I reckon.  

So, 6 football kids plus 6 cheer and band kids... that's 12 kids gotta go.

"
"Well, Charlie's got some big ol' boots! If Sophie's are a size five, and Charlie's are five times bigger, that's like... twenty-five!  

So, you add them together, five plus twenty-five, that's thirty. Then you split that in half 'cause there's two of 'em. Thirty split in half is fifteen.


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... she's got that long flower bed, right?  And them flowers need some room to breathe.  So, if each one takes up a foot and a half, that's like, 18 inches, right?  Plus, she needs another 18 inches between 'em.  So that's 30 inches for each plant.

Now, her bed is, what, 111 feet?  That's a whole lotta inches!  Let's see... 111 times 12... that's 1332 inches.

Hmm, so 1332 divided by 30...  That's a lot of plants!  More than she's got already, that's for sure.

She needs to buy a bunch more, and they're 6 bucks a pop.  Let me grab my calculator...

"
"Edgar eats a whole lotta pretzels, like 18 a day! His brother ain't as hungry, eats half as much. So that's 9 pretzels a day for the little guy.  In a whole week, that's 9 times 7, which is... lemme see... 63 pretzels!

63 

"
"Lemme see... she needs 3 of them flower things and 2 of them vine things for each basket.  That's 5 of them flower things and 10 of them vine things total.

Those flower things cost $3 each, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 bucks. Them vine things cost $2.50 each, so that's 10 times 2.50, which is 25 bucks.

So all together, it's 15 plus 25, which is 40 bucks.

But wait, she's got 5 baskets! So it's 40 times 5...  

That's 200 bucks!


$200.00 

"
"Let's see... they got 30 pounds of dirt. Them sunflowers take up a lot, 3 pounds each, and they're plantin' 4 of 'em. That's 12 pounds right there. Then them carnations, they need a pound and a half each, and they got 10 of those. So that's 15 pounds more.  That's 27 pounds gone already.  

That leaves 3 pounds for roses, and each rose needs a pound. So they can plant 3 roses.

"
"Well, lemme see... she makes two thousand bucks a month, and she saves a quarter of that for shoes, right? So that's five hundred bucks a month for shoes.  In a year, that's six thousand dollars!  If each pair costs a grand, she can get six pairs of shoes.


6 

"
"Well, she peels 'em at 6 a minute, so 90 shrimp would take her 15 minutes, right?  Then cookin' takes a bit longer, she does 30 in 10 minutes, so 90 would be 30 minutes.  So, all together, that's 45 minutes.


45 

"
"Well, lemme see... it cooled down 2 degrees every hour for 3 hours, so that's 6 degrees cooler. Then it got even colder, 3 degrees every hour for 4 hours, so that's another 12 degrees.  That's 18 degrees colder in total. But then it warmed up a bit, 2 degrees every hour for 2 hours, so that's 4 degrees warmer.

So, it ended up 14 degrees colder than it started.

"
"Well, that's a head-scratcher!  Let's see... the comet comes around every 75 years, right? And the dad saw it when he was 30.  His son saw it when he was three times older than that... so that's 3 times 30, which is 90.  

So the son was 90 when he saw it the second time.  Hmm... that means he musta been 75 the first time, 'cause that's 75 years before he was 90.

75 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... he pays electric and gas every month, so that's two checks a month. Church is twice a month, so that's four more. And the yard guys come every three months, so that's four times a year.  

Let's see... two plus four plus four... that's ten a month. Ten times twelve months is...  carry the one...  120 checks! 



"
"That first plane is busy!  It goes to Greece a lot, like, most of the time.  The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies way less, like half as much.  So if that Poland plane does 44 trips, the Greece plane does double that, which is 88.  

If it goes to Greece most of the time, that leaves not many for France and Germany.  Hmm, let's see... 88 take away the Greece trips... that's 22 left.  And they split those trips even, so France gets 11.

"
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two together, so that's 20 plus 40, which is 60 seconds.  All together, they howl for 20 plus 40 plus 60, which is 120 seconds.  That's 2 minutes.

"
"Well, lemme see... Adam got 6 bucks from his mama and his daddy gave him double that, so that's 6 times 2, which is 12 bucks.  That's 6 plus 12, so 18 bucks from his folks.  The pants cost 30 bucks, so he had to use 30 minus 18, which is 12 bucks from his own money.


$12 

"
"Hmm, let's see... they all add up to 20 years, right? Akbar's 3, Alessandro's 4, and Helene's... well, she's twice the average age of all of them, so she must be 10. That's 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.  So Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

"
"Well, lemme see... he got 500 bucks from them neighbors and then another 1500 from that internet thingy. So that's 2000 bucks already. His lawyer fella's gonna give three times that, so that's...  *counts on fingers* 6000 bucks!  

6000 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They had a whole lotta cookies, right? A hundred folks brought fifteen each, so that's a heap!  They gave half to the church, and each person there got fifteen.  Hmm... if they got fifteen each, and they had half the cookies, that means there musta been... fifty people at the church. 


50
"
"Well, lemme see...  If there's two grownups and they get twice as much as the four little ones, that's like sayin' each grownup gets the same as two kids put together, right?

So, that's six parts for the kids and six parts for the grownups, makin' twelve parts total.  Each grownup gets six outta twelve, which is half.

That's 50%!

"
"Well, lemme see... Doc's at the clinic for nine hours. He spends a good chunk of time checkin' on those folks stayin' there, 'bout 20 minutes each.  He's got nine of 'em, so that's 9 times 20... carry the one... that's 180 minutes.  

And then he's got appointments, ten of 'em, each takin' half an hour. So that's 10 times 30...  300 minutes.

Now, lemme see... 180 minutes plus 300 minutes... that's 480 minutes total.  

How many hours is that?  Hmm... 60 minutes in an hour, so 480 divided by 60... that's 8 hours.

So, he's got 9 hours minus 8 hours... that leaves him with 1 hour for his records.

"
"Well, lemme see... she bakes it for a half hour, then it gotta sit for a couple hours, then she puts that fancy stuff on top...  That's gotta be at least three hours, right? So if she wants it ready by 5, she better start around 2.

"Hmm, lemme see... they sold 8 boxes all together, right? And they got 64 candy bars.  So, if ya split them up even, that's 8 bars in each box.

"
"Well, lemme see... they charge 25 bucks just to use the place, right? And then it's a dollar fifty for each kid. So that's 15 bucks more for all ten kids.  So each time they have class, they make 40 bucks. They do that three times a week, so that's 120 bucks a week.  A month has about four weeks, so they make... hmm... carry the one... 480 bucks a month!

"Peter's got 4 boxes o' chocolates, and Martha's got 7. Peter's got 64 chocolates all together, and Martha's got 56.  Hmm... lemme see... if Peter's got 64 chocolates in 4 boxes, that's 16 in each box. Martha's got 56 in 7 boxes, so that's 8 in each box. Peter's got 8 more chocolates in each box than Martha.

"Well, lemme see... there's 50 porcupines, and they say 3 outta every 5 are ladies. So that's 30 lady porcupines.  Each one has 4 babies a month, so that's a whole lotta babies!  

Let's see... 30 times 4 is 120 babies every month.  And there's 12 months in a year, so that's 120 times 12...  carry the one...  that's 1440 babies!

Now, add that to the 50 we started with... 1440 plus 50...  that's a whole mess of porcupines!  1490!

That's 1400 somethin'.  Now times 6...  

*more calculator noises*

That's a lotta gallons!  They said it's 10 cents a gallon, so...

*frantically punches buttons*

It's gonna cost 'em $826 to fill that thing up!

"Lemme see... they got 9 red ones, and 5 more blue than that... so that's 14 blue ones.  And then they got 3 less yellow than blue... so that's 11 yellow ones.

"Well, lemme see... Matteo went 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so that's 55 times 4...  carry the one... that's 220 miles.

Shandy went 45 miles every hour for 10 hours, so that's 45 times 10...  that's 450 miles.

Shandy went way farther! 450 minus 220...  that's 230 miles farther.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So there's 3000 kids at the school, right? Half of 'em are older than me, so that's 1500.  And half of those older kids are boys, so that's... uh... 750 boys.  The other half of the kids are younger, and half of them are boys too, so that's another 750 boys.  

So there's 750 + 750 boys, which is 1500 boys total.

That means there's gotta be 3000 - 1500 = 1500 girls at the school.

So they filled up a quarter of the tank the first day, that's like... 4500 gallons, right? And that Ms. B lady, she filled up a bit less than Wanda, maybe 'round 3000 gallons?

The next day, Wanda filled up less than before, maybe 'round 3000 gallons again? And Ms. B, she didn't fill up as much, maybe like 1000 gallons?

So, all together, they filled up maybe 4500 + 3000 + 3000 + 1000... that's 11500 gallons?

That means they still need... hmm... 18000 - 11500...  that's 6500 gallons more!

**Answer:** 6500

"Well, lemme see... that power bank was losin' juice pretty fast!  It lost a bunch at first, then a little less later.  In the end, it only had 28% left.  

Hmm, that's tricky.  I dunno, maybe it was about... 17% full when she left?  Could be more, could be less, hard to say for sure. 



"
"Well, she makes 25 bucks an hour, right?  'Cause 10 plus 15 is 25. And she works 40 hours, so that's 25 times 40, which is a thousand dollars a week. She needs 2000 for the car, so that's two weeks worth of work.

"
"Lemme see... he got 10 bucks, right?  Peaches and pears is 50 cents each, so that's 1.50 for the peaches and 2 bucks for the pears. Kiwis is a dollar each, so that's 2 bucks more. Apples is 75 cents each, so that's 3.75 for them.  

That's 1.50 + 2 + 2 + 3.75 = 9.25 he spent already.

He got 75 cents left. Plums is 25 cents each, so he can get 3 plums.

27 plus 18... that's 45 selfies and portraits all together.

"Hmm, lemme see... 60 questions, and 40% are easy, so that's like... 24 easy ones.  The rest are hard and medium, so 36 split in half is 18 each.  She gets most of the easy ones, so that's 18 right there. Half the hard and medium ones is 9 each, so that's 9 + 9 more.  

18 + 9 + 9 = 36

Now she gave her sisters some money, 10 bucks each. So that's 20 bucks gone.

"Well, lemme see... they got 6000 seats, but the grads and teachers take up 950 plus 300, so that's 1250 gone.  That leaves 4750 for everyone else.  If there's 950 grads, they each get 5 tickets.

"
"Well, lemme see... He eats a whole bunch of them big jelly beans, like 75.  And then he can eat twice as many of the medium ones, so that's 75 times 2, which is 150.  Now, them little ones, you gotta eat three of 'em to be like one medium one. So, 150 times 3...  carry the one... that's 450 little jelly beans!


450 

"
"Well, lemme see... she worked three days, six hours each day, so that's eighteen hours total.  She gets fifteen bucks a day, so that's forty-five dollars. But then she gotta pay for parking, three bucks a day, so that's nine dollars gone.  So she made thirty-six dollars.  Now, eighteen hours of work... thirty-six dollars... hmm... that's two dollars an hour.


$2 

"
"Lemme see... he bought three of them books at sixteen bucks a pop, so that's...  carry the one... forty-eight dollars. Then he got three pencils at six dollars each, so that's eighteen dollars more.  

Forty-eight plus eighteen... that's sixty-six dollars.


66 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got 24 feet, and he puts a bottle every 3 feet, so that's like... 8 bottles, right?  And he takes 5 seconds to do each one. So, 8 bottles minus 1 'cause he don't gotta walk to the first one... that's 7 times he gotta walk. 7 times 5 seconds is... 35 seconds!


35 

"
"Well, lemme see... He got two boxes with forty apples each, so that's a whole lotta apples, right?  That's eighty apples in total.  And he puts eight in each pack.  So, eighty divided by eight... hmm... that's ten packs!


10 

"
"Lemme see... that Parmesan's pricey, ain't it?  Two pounds of that'll be twenty-two bucks.  And the mozzarella, three pounds of that's eighteen.  So all that cheese is forty dollars.  If she started with fifty, she's got ten bucks left for meat.


$10
"
"Well, lemme see... he borrowed a whole lotta money, like 50 grand every year for four years. That's a lotta dough!  So that's 200,000 bucks right there. And he was makin' 25,000 a year before, but now he's makin' three times that, so that's 75,000 a year.  But he didn't work for four years, so he missed out on 100,000 bucks there.

So, he needs to make back 300,000 bucks total.  If he's makin' 75,000 a year, it'll take him 4 years to catch up.


4 

"
"Well, lemme see... he needs it bigger than the bed, right? So, that's like, 6 feet plus 2, that's 8. And then another 2, so that's 10 feet long.  And for the wide part, it's 8 feet plus 2, that's 10. And then 2 more, so that's 12 feet wide.

Now, how much fabric is that?  10 times 12...  

120 

"
"Lemme see... they got 425 letters on Monday. Then on Tuesday, they got, uh... lemme do this on my fingers... 425 divided by 5 is 85, and then add 17 more... that's 102 letters.

Wednesday was tricky. Twice Tuesday's amount is 204, and then 5 more... so 209 letters.

Now, add 'em all up: 425 + 102 + 209...  that's 736 letters!


736 

"
"Lemme see... 10 folks want the chicken thingy at 6 bucks and some change... so that's like 60 somethin'.  Then 6 folks want the pasta, that's 36 bucks.  Add those together and it's gotta be a little over a hundred bucks, right?


$101.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... He lost 5 bucks on the first one. Then he won 11 on the second, but then lost 16.50 on the third.  That's a lotta losin'!  

So, all together he lost 21.50, and there were three races.  

21.50 split three ways is... lemme grab my calculator...  

$7.17 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... 26 countries, and each one has 5 towns with a thousand folks in each town... so that's...  5 times a thousand is 5000.  And then you gotta do that 26 times...  

Carry the one...  

130,000 people! 


130,000
"
"Cole's a little taller now, I think by just one inch. 


1 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got $1920 all together. The second fella got more than the first, and the third got double what the second got.  Hmm... that's tricky.

Let's say the first guy got, like, $400. Then the second guy got $480, and the third guy got $960.  

Add that up, and it's $1840.  Not quite right.

Maybe the first guy got a bit more... how about $420?

Then the second guy got $500, and the third guy got $1000.

That's $1920!  

So the first guy got $420.


$420
"
"Well, lemme see... they worked three-eighths of a day, which is like, less than half.  And they did that for three whole weeks, so that's a lotta days.  Hmm, lemme count... three times seven is twenty-one days.  So, they worked twenty-one days times nine hours a day...  

189 

"
"Well, lemme see... he got 19 balls total, right? And the third set was half of the second set.  So, if we think about it, the second set musta been a good amount, 'cause the third was half and they still got 19 all together.  

I'd say he got 10 balls in the first set. 


10
"
"That's a tough one!  Cars lose value fast, don't they?  I know my truck was worth way less after a few years.  Hmm, 21% less each year for three years... lemme see...  

Let's see... 20,000 times 0.21 is 4,200. So after one year, it's worth 15,800. Then another 21% off... that's...  

...

Okay, I think it's around 9,800 bucks.


9860.62 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... Half the books are in English, so that's 25. And some are in German, 10%...  that's like, a few.  So the rest gotta be Spanish, right?  I'd say there's probably 'bout 20 Spanish books.


20 

"
"Well, she drove a ways, that's for sure.  Let's see... 1955... that's a long way!  If she did 325 each day for four days, that's like...  *counts on fingers*  1300!  So she gotta drive... hmm... 1955 minus 1300...  

655 



"
"Well, lemme see... she drinks 8 cups a day, and there's 16 in a gallon, so that's... hmm... half a gallon a day, right?  So in a month, that's like... 15 gallons, I reckon.


15 

"
"Well, lemme see... started with a bunch of folks, right?  Then more got on, then some got off, then more got on again...  

Let's see... 120, then plus 20... that's 140. Then some got off, 50, and twice that got on... so that's 100 more... 140 plus 100... that's 240!  But wait, more got off at the end... 80... so 240 minus 80...

160! 



"
"Lemme see... she got a shirt for ten bucks.  Her shorts were five more than that, so that's fifteen. Her shoes were half off, so they were twenty-four dollars. And the socks were eight dollars but she got two bucks off, so those were six.  

If you add all that up, it's fifty-five dollars.


55 

"
"Well, lemme see...  You got 200 squares to cover, right? And each of them little tiles is a dollar a piece. So, that's gonna be... 200 times 12...  

$2400 

"
"Well, lemme see... so his insurance went up 'cause he had a wreck, right?  They said it was 60% more, and it used to be $120 a month.  So, that's like...  an extra $72 a month, I guess?  So now it's $192 a month.  

That's a lot!  

So, a year is 12 months, so that's $192 times 12...  

Hold on, lemme get my calculator...

$2304 



"
"Well, lemme see... he washes them twin sheets two at a time, so that's two loads for them. And he washes the big one by itself, so that's one more.  That's three loads a week.  

Now, there's 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 times 52...  carry the one... that's 156 loads.


156 

"
"Well, they watch 4 movies on Saturday, and then half of that on Sunday, so that's 2.  That's 4 plus 2, so 6 movies every weekend.  And if they do that for 4 weeks, that's 6 times 4... lemme see...  carry the one... that's 24 movies!


24 

"
"Well, lemme see... He had a hundred stickers, then got fifty more. That's a hundred and fifty, right? And this year he got a whole 'nother fifty on top of that! So that's... two hundred and fifty stickers!

250 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she feeds 'em 60 grams each, twice a day, so that's 120 grams a day for each kitty.  Three kitties is 360 grams a day.  She's got 720 grams, so that's...  two days worth of food.

"
"Becky ate 10, Jake ate 7, and Silvia ate 14.  That's a whole lotta pizza!  

10 + 7 + 14 = 31 

31 

"
"Well, Donovan did his part first, right? And Betsy took longer, like 18 minutes more.  If they did it all in 98 minutes, Betsy musta been cookin' for a while.  Hmm... lemme see... 98 minus 18... that's 80. So Donovan did his part in 40 minutes, and Betsy took 58.


58 

"
"Dang, that's a lot of stuff!  Let's see... the cast is 200 bucks, and the doctor wants 300 bucks an hour, but she was only there for half an hour, so that's 150 bucks.  Then there's the pills, 4 bucks a pop for 30 of 'em, so that's 120 bucks. And don't forget the parking, 6 bucks an hour for two hours, so that's 12 bucks.

Add it all up, 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 bucks! Ouch, that's a lot for a broken arm!


482 

"
"Well, lemme see... He gets a whole lotta emails, like 80 every day. But some of them, like 20 outta every 100, he don't gotta answer. So that's 16 he can just ignore.  That leaves him with 64 he gotta answer each day.  Now, if he works 5 days a week, that's 64 times 5...  

320 

"
"Let's see... they had a bunch of kids come by.  Monday was 32, then double that on Tuesday, so that's 64. Wednesday was even more, three times Monday, so that's 96. Then Thursday was 30 and Friday was 25.  

Hmm, lemme add that up... 32 plus 64 plus 96 plus 30 plus 25...  

247! That's a lot of kids!


247 

"
"Well, lemme see... He got a hundred three times, so that's like three hundred. Then he got an eighty, so you add that up, that's three eighty.  Then you gotta split that up by four 'cause he took four tests.  

95 

"
"They ate a whole lotta pizza!  Let's see... glee club ate most of theirs, like 14 pies. Football team got double, so that's 40, and they ate most of them too, like 32.  So, there's gotta be, like, 14 left over.


14 

"
"Okay, so he's sendin' out a whole lotta coupons, huh?  Let's see... 700 little ones and double that in big ones, so that's 1400 big ones.  

Them little coupons cost a nickel each, so that's 700 times 5 cents... lemme grab my calculator... that's 35 bucks.

The big ones cost 15 cents each, so 1400 times 15 cents...  carry the one... that's 210 bucks.

Now we gotta add those together... 35 plus 210...  that's 245 bucks for all them coupons.


$245.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... Sidney had some sandwiches, right?  He had less than ten, but then ate some.  Then he got more.  That's a lotta sandwiches!  

I dunno, maybe 'bout 36 meatballs? 


36
"
"Well, lemme see... He had 20 trucks, right? And each one had 20 big ol' bags of that fertilizer stuff.  But then 5 of them broke down. So that leaves 15 trucks that made it.  

If each truck has 20 bags, then 15 trucks would have... hmm... carry the one... 300 bags! 


300 

"
"Well, lemme see... he needs 6 dozen croissants, and that's 6 pounds of butter.  The butter's 4 bucks a pound, so that's 6 times 4...  carry the one... that's 24 dollars. But wait, there's a deal! Buy one, get one half off. So that's like... 3 pounds at full price and 3 pounds half off.  Hmm... half of 4 is 2... so those 3 pounds are 12 bucks. And the other 3 are 6 bucks.  So, 12 plus 6... that's 18 bucks!


$18.00 

"
"Okay, so Kayla's party is gonna cost some money.  Let's see... she invited a bunch of folks, like 25 from school, 7 from dancin', and 13 from her family. That's a lotta people!  But some can't make it, like 4. So, lemme see... 25 plus 7 plus 13 is 45.  Then take away the 4 who can't come, that's 41 people.

Now, the theater costs 125 bucks for the first 20 people, right? And then it's 6 bucks more for each extra person. So, 41 minus 20 is 21 extra people.  That's 21 times 6, which is... lemme grab my calculator... 126 bucks.

So, add that to the first 125 bucks, and it's 251 bucks for the party!


251 

"
"Maggie spent some of her money, and Riza did too. They both started with sixty bucks.  Maggie spent a quarter, so that's like, fifteen dollars. Riza spent a third, which is twenty dollars.  So Maggie has forty-five left, and Riza has forty.  If you add those together, they got eighty-five dollars left.

"
"Well, lemme see... he buys a whole lotta bananas, enough for a whole week.  Those first two monkeys sure do eat a lot!  If one eats ten and the other eats four more, that's fourteen, right?  So that's twenty-four bananas gone already.  

Now, if he's got forty-five bananas each day, that means the third monkey gets the rest... so that's twenty-one bananas for him!


21 

"
"Well, lemme see... He did half of that big puzzle, so that's like, 250 pieces, right? And then he did a whole other one, so that's 500 more.  

So, 250 plus 500... that's a lotta pieces! 750! 


750
"
"Well, lemme see... she got 15 roses, right?  So that's like a whole bunch.  She got them five dollar bills, so that's twenty-five bucks.  Roses are two bucks a pop, so that's thirty bucks for fifteen roses.  But wait, a dozen's cheaper, so it's fifteen bucks for a dozen and then three more roses at two bucks each, so that's six more bucks.  That's twenty-one bucks total.  So she gets four bucks back.  Now, how many quarters is that?  Hmm... four dollars is like, four hundred pennies.  And a quarter is twenty-five cents, so that's sixteen quarters.


16 

"
"Lemme see... six milkshakes at five-fifty each... that's thirty-three bucks.  Nine burger platters at eleven bucks a pop... that's ninety-nine. And twenty sodas at a dollar-fifty... that's thirty.  

So, thirty-three plus ninety-nine plus thirty...  

162.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... that first train comes in 10 minutes, and hangs around for 20. Then the next one comes a half hour after the first one leaves, but only stays for 5 minutes.  The third one shows up an hour after that one leaves, and then zooms right back out.  The one Paul wants comes 20 minutes after that. So... that's 10 + 20 + 30 + 5 + 60 + 20...  

Let me count that up...  

115 



"
"Well, she's got 120 toothpicks already, right? And she needs 200. So that's 80 more she needs. She gets 10 a week, so that's... 8 weeks.

"
"Well, lemme see... that watch was two thousand bucks, right?  That fella Rogers got it for, like, fifteen hundred, 'cause it was on sale. Then he sold it to his buddy for eighteen hundred.  So, his buddy saved two hundred bucks, which is like, ten percent off the original price.

"
"Well, lemme see... if one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's a whole lotta jellyfish!  Five springs makin' 'em at the same time... that's like, five times as many!  And four hours is a long time...  

Hmm...  I reckon that's a whole heap of jellyfish!  Gotta be... a lot!

"
"Well, lemme see... Binkie got 90, right? And Frankie did way better, like double that plus some more.  Double 90 is 180, and then you gotta add 15... so Frankie got 195!

"
"Well, he walked 2 miles to the middle, then 2 miles back, so that's 4 miles already. Then he walks another 2 miles to the store. That's 6 miles total.  If he walks 4 miles an hour, it took him an hour and a half.


1.5 

"
"Well, lemme see... she buys ten bunches, right? And each bunch has four bananas, so that's forty bananas in total. If she bought them one by one, it'd be eighty cents a pop, so that's thirty-two bucks. But the bunches are three bucks each, so ten bunches is thirty bucks.  She saved two dollars!

"Well, if they got a hundred feet all together, and Harry's gettin' a whole lot more, Sam's probably gettin' not much.  Maybe like 20 feet?

"
"Well, if it grows 8 inches in 4 years, that's like 2 inches every year, right? So in 13 years, it'd be 2 times 13... lemme see... that's 26 inches!

"
"Okay, so Marcel sells bikes, right?  He's got them mountain bikes, those BMX ones the kids like, and the regular bikes for ridin' around.

He sold a bunch, like 300 bikes! Half of them were those regular bikes, so that's 150. And 15% were BMX, so that's 45.  The rest gotta be mountain bikes, so that's 105.

Now, mountain bikes are 500 bucks each. BMX are half that, so 250 bucks.  Regular bikes are 450.

Let's see... 150 regular bikes times 450 bucks... that's 67,500.  BMX are 45 bikes times 250... that's 11,250. And the mountain bikes are 105 times 500... that's 52,500.

Add all that up, and Marcel made 131,250 bucks that month!

"
"Well, lemme see... the farmer makes 5 bales every hour, and he works for 6 hours, so that's 5 times 6... which is 30 bales.  The truck takes away 3 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 3 times 6... which is 18 bales.  

So, if he makes 30 and the truck takes 18, there's gotta be 12 bales left.


12 

"
"Well, lemme see... he goes to class a whole lotta times, eight times a day! That's like, two extra classes on top of the regular ones.  Each class is 40 minutes, so that's 320 minutes a day just for classes.  And he does that five days a week, so that's a lot of minutes!  

Then on the weekend, he does some more learnin', like a hundred minutes each day.  

Gosh, that's a lot of learnin'!  I bet he's real smart.

30 



"
"Well, lemme see... He drops it from way up high, right?  Three floors, that's like... a whole lotta feet!  And it bounces back up, but not all the way.  It goes, like, two-thirds of the way back up.  So, if it goes down three floors, then up two-thirds of that... hmm... that's gotta be less than three floors, right?  

Let's see... three floors is a lot, so two-thirds of that is... maybe...  

**Answer:** 32 



"
"Well, lemme see... the first kid's six feet tall, right?  That's like, a whole lotta inches.  The second one's taller by a couple inches, so that's, uh... 74 inches maybe?  Then the third one's shorter by five inches, so that's... less.  And the last one's taller than that one by three inches... so, hmm... 72 inches?  I think?


72 

"
"Well, lemme see... they sold 2000 apples, and each bag has 10, so that's 200 bags.  If they sell each bag for 5 bucks, then they made 200 times 5...  

$1000 

"
"That T-Rex sure was hungry!  Let's see... them Allosaurus got 270 kilos, and that was just what was left after them sneaky velociraptors had their fill. So before them raptors, there was double that, right? That's 540 kilos. And that was only half of what was on that triceratops before the T-Rex got to it! So the triceratops musta had 1080 kilos of meat on it! 


1080
"
"Well, lemme see...  You got four walls, right? Two big ones and two little ones.  The big ones are like, ten steps long and eight steps high.  The little ones are five steps long and eight steps high.

Now, that paint stuff says it covers twenty steps by steps.  And each can costs twelve bucks.

Hmm...  That's a lot of steppin' and countin'.  Let me think...

...

Okay, so you gotta figure out how many steps all the walls are, then see how many cans you need.  Then you multiply that by the price.  

...

I think it's gonna cost you $144.

"
"Well, lemme see... Ellen had 3 bad sodas, right? And her brother took one of them. So there's still 2 bad ones left.  She had 12 sodas to start, took one, and her brother took 3, so there's 8 left.  

So, I guess there's a 2 outta 8 chance her friend gets a squirty one.  That's like, a quarter, right?

"
"Well, shoot, that's a head-scratcher!  One train's goin' 60 miles an hour, the other's goin' 30.  They're goin' in opposite directions, so they're gettin' farther apart real quick.  After 3 hours, the fast one's gone 180 miles (60 times 3) and the slow one's gone 90 miles (30 times 3).  Add those together, and they're 270 miles apart!


270 

"
"Well, lemme see... he helps 2 folks every hour, and he works 3 hours a day, so that's 2 times 3, which is 6 people a day.  Now, there's a whole bunch of days between March and April, gotta be more than 30... lemme count... 31 in March plus 19 in April, that's 50 days.  But he takes some days off, 20% of them...  

*counts on fingers*

That's 10 days off. So he works 40 days.  

If he helps 6 people a day, and he works 40 days, that's 6 times 40... which is 240 people!


240 

"
"Well, lemme see... they had a whole bunch of cars and buses, right?  Each bus held a lotta folks, like maybe 35 or somethin'. And the cars, they only fit a few, maybe 3 in each.  So, if they had 12 buses and 20 cars... that's a lot of people!  

Gotta be... hmm...  I dunno, maybe like 480 or somethin'?


480 

"
"Well, Mike's 24, and Martha's a bit younger, like 4 years younger I think. So Martha's 20.  And Jeff's older than Martha by 10 years, so Jeff's gotta be 30.


30 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... that big slide is 300 feet, and they go down it at 60 feet a minute. So that's... 300 divided by 60...  that's 5 minutes.

The other one is shorter, 240 feet, and they go faster, 80 feet a minute. So that's 240 divided by 80... that's 3 minutes.

So the big one takes 2 minutes longer.


2 

"
"Well, lemme see... he takes a half hour lunch, right? And two fifteen minute breaks, so that's like, another half hour.  So an hour total each day.  Five days is like... five hours.

"
"Micah ran a whole lot more than Amber, like, almost four times as much!  So Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran, lemme see... 8 times 3 and a half is 28 miles. That's a lot of miles! So together they ran 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 minus 36, which is 16 miles.


16 

"
"Okay, so she had 85 bucks on there, then took back somethin' for 15 bucks.  That leaves her with 70 bucks. Then she bought a pan for, lemme see, 20 bucks off means it was 16 bucks. And the towels were 30 bucks, but 10% off, so that's 3 bucks off, makin' them 27 bucks. So the pan and towels were 16 plus 27, which is 43 bucks.  Add that to the 70 she had left, and that's 113 bucks.


$113.00 

"
"Well, lemme see...  If 6 jellyfish turned blue, and that's just a third of the big ones, then there musta been 6 times 3, which is 18 big jellyfish.

And if those are just a fifth of all the jellyfish, then there's gotta be 18 times 5, which is 90 jellyfish in total.

"
"Well, lemme see... Chris is 4, right? And Ben's twice that, so he's 8. Caroline's three times older than Ben, so that's...  carry the one... 24!

"
"Well, lemme see... she wants to save up enough to live on 40,000 a year for 20 years. That's 40,000 times 20, which is 800,000 bucks!

And she saves 20,000 a year. So, it'll take her 800,000 divided by 20,000... which is 40 years.

40 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He's got a hundred of them centimeters things, right? And he wants four pieces, then cuts them up into five more pieces. So, that's like, a lotta little pieces.  

Let's see... a hundred divided by four is twenty-five. Then twenty-five divided by five is... five!

"Well, if 40 outta every 100 kids are boys, and that's 240 boys, then there must be a whole lotta girls!  Let's see... 240 boys is like 40 outta 100, so that means there's gotta be 600 kids total.  

If there's 240 boys, then there's gotta be 360 girls.


360 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She bought stuff for 19 and 26... that's 45 all together. But she had a coupon, so it's less than that... 45 take away 7...  

38 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Six ladies, three wearin' four-inch heels, three wearin' two-inch heels...  That's, uh...  

Let's see...  Four plus four plus four is twelve. Two plus two plus two is six. Twelve plus six is eighteen.  

Eighteen divided by six...  That's three!

"
"Well, shoot, that's a lot of walkin'!  She's doin' 250 miles a day already, and she needs to do 9300 miles total.  That's like walkin' across the whole country a couple times!  

Let's see... 9300 minus 7500... that's 1800 more miles she needs.  And there's 30 days in June... so she needs to do 60 more miles each day.


60 

"
"Lemme see... so they got 3 red ones, 11 blue ones, and a whole bunch of green ones, 25 I think?  Red ones are nine bucks each, blue ones are five, and green ones are three.  

So, that's 3 times 9... that's 27 for the reds.  Then 11 times 5... that's 55 for the blues. And 25 times 3...  carry the one... that's 75 for the greens.

Now we add those up... 27 plus 55 plus 75...  

157! That's how much they'll get.


157
"
"Let's see... they got 12 big bags of apples. Peter takes a quarter, that's like cuttin' it into four pieces and takin' one. So he gets 3 bags. Paul wants a third, so that's like cuttin' it into three pieces, he gets 4 bags.  That's 7 bags gone.  

So James gets the rest, which is 5 bags.

"
"Brrr, it was cold!  It was two degrees, then got way colder, like, eight degrees colder. But then it warmed up a bit, maybe three degrees.  So I guess it was minus three degrees in the mornin'.


-3 

"
"Lemme see... he had 21 bucks, then got 11 more, so that's 32. Then he spent 5 on a comic, so 32 minus 5 is 27. Then he spent 19 on a puzzle...  27 minus 19...  that's 8 bucks left.


$8 

"
"Well, lemme see... She had 16 bucks and spent 4, so that leaves her with 12. Then she buys two books and has 2 bucks left.  So she spent 12 - 2 = 10 bucks on books.

If she got two books for 10 bucks, each one cost 5 bucks!


$5 

"
"Well, lemme see...  If they had 50 last year and got 20 more this year, that's gotta be 70, right?


70 

"
"Well, if it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that's a lotta blinkin'!  

Let's see... 459 blinks... hmm...  That's almost double, ain't it?  So maybe it'll take 'bout twice as long...  

9 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa fishies!  He had more girl fishies than boy fishies to start. Then he got more girl fishies.  I bet he's got, like, five more girl fishies than boy fishies now.

"
"Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan walked the dog, and that took her longer, like 6 hours I think. Dior did laundry, and that takes forever, maybe 8 hours? So, all together, that's 4 plus 6 plus 8... hmm... 18 hours!


18 

"
"Well, he drives for 2 hours each way, so that's 2 hours times 2, which is 4 hours of drivin' total.  And if he's goin' 70 miles an hour, that's 70 times 4, which is 280 miles.  But he does that twice a month, so it's 280 times 2, which is... lemme see... 560 miles!

560 

"
"Sofie walks a whole lotta miles, ten each day for a whole week! That's like, seventy miles! Brian's gotta walk half that, so... lemme see... half of seventy is thirty-five.


35 

"
"Well, lemme see... they need 400 toys, right? And them four fellas make 120 plus 80, so that's 200 toys already.  That leaves 200 more to go, but they're still short 20. So that means that fifth guy gotta make up the rest, which is 220 toys.  Now, they work for 10 hours, so he makes 22 toys each hour.


22 

"
"Well, Kory's dog is a big fella at 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is a quarter of that, so that's 15 pounds. His other dog is half the size of Kory's, so that's 30 pounds.  

Let's see... 15 plus 30 is 45 pounds for Elijah's dogs.  Add Kory's 60 pound dog, and that's 105 pounds all together.


105 

"
"Well, lemme see... Kris got 7 stickers from someone, and had 9 more, so that's 16 stickers total.  That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers, right? And Luis only had half of what Seth had, so Seth musta had a whole bunch!  Luis had 32 stickers, so Seth had double that... 64!


64 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got three big bags, and each one's got ten of them ounces, right? So that's thirty ounces all together.  And if each ounce has thirty of them little candies, that's a whole lotta M&Ms!  

Let's see... thirty times thirty... that's nine hundred!  

Now, he wants to put ten in each little bag... so that's nine hundred divided by ten...  

Hmm... carry the one... that's ninety bags! 


90 

"
"Well, that Alfie sure flies a lot!  If he goes 400 clicks a day, and the world's a big ol' 40,000 clicks around, half of that's... lemme see... 20,000 clicks.

So, 20,000 clicks divided by 400 clicks a day... that's 50 days.

50 

"
"Wow, 120 miles per hour is super fast!  That second fastest car must be like a rocket, goin' 5 times faster, so that's 600 miles per hour! And the fastest one?  That's gotta be even crazier, like 1 and a quarter times faster... lemme see...  carry the one... that's 750 miles per hour!

750 

"
"Well, lemme see... Liam's 16 now, so two years ago he was 14.  That means Vince was 7 back then. So now Vince is 9.

"
"Camden painted a whole bunch more than Arnold.  Let's see... Camden did 21 and Arnold only did 13.  That's 8 more!


8 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... 200 crayons, 8 in a box... that's 25 boxes, right?  Each box weighs 8 ounces, so that's 200 ounces for the boxes. And the crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too, 'cause they're one ounce each.  So that's 400 ounces all together.  Now, how many pounds is that?  16 ounces in a pound... so 400 divided by 16...  

25 

"
"Well, lemme see... that's a mighty big tree!  He can use most of it, 'bout 64 feet.  Each log is 4 feet, so that's a lotta logs, 16 of 'em!  Each log makes 5 planks, so that's 80 planks in all.  If he sells each plank for a buck twenty, he's makin' $96.


$96 

"
"Well, lemme see... Valerie makes 5000 bucks a month, and that's half what her brother makes. So her brother makes 5000 times 2, which is 10,000 bucks.  Together they make 5000 plus 10,000, so that's 15,000. Their momma makes double that, so she makes 15,000 times 2, which is 30,000.  Add it all up, 5000 plus 10,000 plus 30,000, and they got 45,000 bucks altogether.


45000 

"
"Well, she walks 2 miles on the beach and that takes her 40 minutes.  So, she's walkin' slow on the sand.  She walks the other mile on the sidewalk, and she's faster there.  I reckon the whole walk takes her about 50 minutes. 


50
"
"Well, lemme see... she saves 4 bucks a week, right? And she's already got 32 bucks saved up.  So she needs 28 more dollars.  That's 7 more weeks of savin'.


7 

"
"Lemme see...  Three trees with seven birdies each... that's a lotta birdies!  

*counts on fingers*

Three times seven is twenty-one. Then two more trees with four birdies... that's eight more.  

*counts on fingers again*

Twenty-one plus eight is twenty-nine... and then one more tree with three birdies.

*counts on fingers one last time*

Twenty-nine plus three is thirty-two!  

32 

"
"Well, lemme see... if he gets 2 dozen more, that's like 2 times 12, right? So that's 24 more marbles.  If that makes 60, then he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before.  If he loses 10, then he's got 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.


26 

"
"Well, that fancy water gotta be pretty darn hot, I reckon.  If the cold one's only 33 degrees, and he needs it at least 40, that other water's gotta be way hotter to make up the difference.  I'd say at least 68 degrees, maybe even hotter! 


68
"
"Well, lemme see... He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens, right?  Then he gets 20 more cows every day for three weeks, that's like 20 times 7 times 3...  carry the one...  that's a lotta cows! And 10 chickens every day for three weeks too.  So many chickens!  

Let's see...  50 cows plus all them new cows... and 20 chickens plus all them new chickens...  

Gosh, that's a whole heap of animals! I bet it's over 600!


700 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so he buys four of them bagel packs, right? And each one costs ten bucks. So that's forty bucks total. But then he gets a discount, ten percent off.  That's like, four dollars off, I think. So it's thirty-six dollars now.

And he gets thirty-six bagels, 'cause four packs times nine bagels each. So each bagel costs a dollar.


$1.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... Gomer ate a whole lotta potatoes! He ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's like... 18 scoops.  And each scoop needs, what, like a potato and a half? So, 18 scoops times a potato and a half... that's gotta be a bunch!  

27 

"
"Lemme see... he eats 3 a day for a month, that's like 3 times 30... hmm... 90 eggs! Then he eats 5 a day for another month, so that's 5 times 30... 150 eggs!  

So that's 90 plus 150...  240 eggs in total. Now, how many dozens is that? A dozen's 12, right? So 240 divided by 12...  

20 dozen! 


20
"
"Well, lemme see...  There's 17 green ones and double that in red, so that's 17 times 2, which is 34 red ones.  That's a lotta red!  So that's 17 plus 34, which is 51 green and red.  If there's 60 all together, then there's gotta be 60 minus 51, which is 9 blue ones.


9 

"
"Well, lemme see... he gets 6 lemons from each tree, and he's got 5 trees, so that's 6 times 5, which is 30 lemons every year.  A decade is 10 years, so he gets 30 times 10 lemons, which is... 300 lemons! 


300 

"
"Well, lemme see... they say there's 5 fellas for every 9 ladies on the bus. That's a lotta ladies!  If there's 84 folks in total, and 20 of them ladies get off,  there's gotta be... hmm...  34 ladies left. 


34
"
"Well, lemme see... he sells those sunflowers for two bucks a pop, and them bouquets for eight.  He makes 26 bucks from the single sunflowers each day, and 56 from the bouquets.  Each bouquet has a dozen sunflowers in it, so that's like sellin' 12 sunflowers for eight bucks.

Hmm... so over three days, that's 26 bucks a day times three days, that's 78 bucks from the single sunflowers. And the bouquets, that's 56 bucks a day times three days, that's 168 bucks.  

So, all together, he makes 78 plus 168, that's 246 bucks from sunflowers over three days.

Now, if each sunflower costs two bucks, he musta sold 246 divided by 2, which is 123 sunflowers.


123 

"
"Well, lemme see... He buys rocks for 5 bucks a pop, and sells 'em for 7.  So he makes 2 bucks on each one. He starts with a hundred bucks, so that's 20 rocks. If he sells most of 'em, say, 12, that's 12 times 2 bucks, which is 24 bucks profit. But he spent a hundred, so he loses... hmm... 100 minus 24...  

$76 



"
"Well, lemme see... she draws 5 big pictures a day, so those'll take her 9 days.  The medium ones, she does 6 a day, so that's 6 days. And the little ones, 7 a day, so that's 7 days.  Add it all up, that's 22 days.


22 

"
"Well, lemme see... Three dozens eggs is a whole lotta eggs! That's like, 3 times 12, so that's 36 eggs.  And she's got 4 kids, so if they share fair, each kid gets 9.


9 

"
"Lemme see... she gots 3 fishies, and each one eats a dollar's worth of food every day.  So that's 3 bucks a day. May has, what, like 30 days? So that's 3 times 30...  

$90 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... She had 30, gave away a bunch...  that leaves her with, uh... 6. Then she got more, 15 more... so that's 6 plus 15...  

21 

"
"Well, lemme see... he went 110 miles then another 140, so that's a whole lotta miles, right?  250 miles in all. And he did it in 2 hours plus 3 more, so 5 hours total.

Hmm, 250 miles split up over 5 hours... that's 50 miles each hour. 


50 

"
"Well, that first ticket's a long shot, only one in five chance. But the other one, that's a good one, three times better! So, if that one wins, it's like, 6 outta 10, right?  

Now, both of 'em winnin'? That's tougher.  Hmm... lemme see...  

12% 

"
"Jim got 27, Carlos got a few less than that, like 22. Carrey got even less, maybe 11?  So that's 27 plus 22 plus 11, which is... lemme see... 60!  They split 'em up, so each guy gets 20.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... He eats four carrots each day, right? So that's like, four times five, which is twenty. And then on the weekend, he eats five each day, so that's ten more.  

Twenty plus ten... that's thirty carrots!


30 

"
"That second song's a bit longer, huh?  Let's see... 5 minutes plus... hmm... 60% of 5 is like...  3 more minutes? So that song's 8 minutes.  

All together, that's 13 minutes. 


13
"
"He buys 'em for 20 bucks and sells 'em for 40, so he makes 20 bucks on each one.  He bought 2 on Monday, so that's 20 bucks times 2, which is 40 bucks. Then he bought 4 on Tuesday, so that's 20 bucks times 4, which is 80 bucks.  Add those together and he made 40 plus 80, which is 120 bucks.


120 

"
"Well, lemme see... Isabel's real tall, seven feet! Ned's shorter, by two feet, so he's five feet. Carl's a foot taller than Ned, so he's six feet.  His cane's half his size, so that's three feet.

"
"Well, lemme see... they make a whole lotta juice, like 4200 bottles a day. And each one gives ya 20% of what ya need for the whole day.  So, if you got 2300 folks, that's a lotta hungry mouths!  

Hmm, gotta figure out how much more juice they need to make...  Let's see... 2300 people times 100%... that's a lot of percentages!  

Okay, so they're makin' 4200 bottles times 20%... that's a lotta energy already.  But it ain't enough. Gotta figure out the difference...

Man, math is hard!  I dunno, maybe they need to make a whole bunch more bottles? Like, a whole lotta more.


7300 

"
"Well, lemme see... She's got eight babies, right? And six of 'em are wearin' purple. Two of them are wearin' blue.  

Now, half of the purple babies got bows, so that's three with bows. And both the blue babies got bows too. So that's five babies with bows total.

Outta those five, three are wearin' purple. So, I'd say there's a... hmm...  a fifty-fifty chance a baby with a bow is wearin' purple.

50 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... they got a whole bunch of papers, right?  

So, they got a bunch on Monday and Tuesday, then some more on Thursday and Friday.  That's like, almost all of 'em.  

If you take away all those papers from the whole week, what's left over is Wednesday's pile.

So, it's gotta be 1125. 



"
"Lemme see... he had 80 squares of land, right?  Sold half for 50 bucks, so that's 40 squares gone. Then he sold some more, 10 squares I think, for 30 bucks.  That leaves him with 30 squares. He sold those for 3 bucks each, so that's 90 bucks.

Add it all up: 50 + 30 + 90... that's 170 bucks!

"Haley's half her age is 13, right?  So Geb is 3 years old.

"
"Well, lemme see... He changes his mask twice every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day. So that's two times three, which is six masks a day.  Then, over two days, that's six times two...

"
"Cole put a whole lotta eggs out there, like 3 times 12, that's a lot! Lamar found some, then Stacy found double what Lamar did. Charlie found a few less than Stacy, and Mei found half of what Charlie got.  

Hmm, lemme see... that's a lot of countin'.  I think there's still 9 eggs hidin'.

"
"Okay, so this guy John, he picks up trash from a lotta apartments, right?  

Two of 'em got 200 apartments each, so that's 200 plus 200, which is 400.  

The last one is way bigger, like, 60% more than those two put together.  So that's like, 400 times 0.60, which is 240 more apartments.

So the big one has 400 plus 240, which is 640 apartments.

That's a lotta trash!  All together, that's 400 plus 400 plus 640, so 1440 apartments.

He goes to each one three times a week, so that's 1440 times 3, which is 4320 times he picks up the trash.

He gets 40 cents for each time he picks up trash, so that's 4320 times 0.40, which is... lemme see...  

$1728.00 



"
"Well, lemme see... that there avocado tree, it starts makin' fruit when it's 'bout five years old.  Gives ya 'bout fifty avocados that first year. Then it gets bigger and stronger, so by the time it's six, it's makin' way more, like three times as much!  

That's 150 avocados!  And the next year, it's even more, seven times the first year, so that's 350 avocados!  

Now, when it's eight years old, it's gettin' close to its prime, but not quite as good as when it's ten.  I reckon it makes a whole bunch less than when it's ten, maybe 200 less.

By the time it's ten, it's really pumpin' out the avocados, like twenty times what it did when it was just a little sprout. That's a whole lotta avocados, 1000!

But then, the ninth year, it takes a break, no avocados at all.

So, if you add up all the avocados from all the years, it's a whole heap!

"Sophia gave Jack twenty bucks.  So now he's got a hundred and twenty dollars.

"Well, lemme see...  

That red rope is a right long one!  It's like, four times longer than that little blue one. And that blue one is shorter than the yellow one by, what was it, seven centimeters?  

All three together are 37 centimeters long.  Hmm...  

Let me think...  

If the red one is four times the blue one, and they all add up to 37...  

Gotta be... 20 centimeters!

"
"Ronnie had 5 bucks, and Rissa had way more, like three times that!  They both gave some to their little sis. Rissa still had most of her money, like four out of five of it.  That means Ronnie only had 2 bucks left.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Half the paint is yellow, so that's 12 pints divided by 2, which is 6 pints.  That leaves 6 pints for the other colors.  They all use the same amount, so red gets 6 pints split 3 ways, which is 2 pints.

"
"Well, lemme see... four bedrooms, each one's twenty by twelve... that's like, twenty times twelve, right?  So each one's two hundred and forty square feet.  Four of them, that's...  carry the one... nine hundred and sixty.  The livin' room's five times bigger than one bedroom, so that's...  twelve hundred!  And the rest of the house is a thousand square feet.  So, add it all up... nine sixty plus twelve hundred plus a thousand... that's...  

3160 

"
"Well, lemme see... she saw 3 on Monday. Then double that on Tuesday, so that's 6. Then double that on Wednesday, so 12. Then double that on Thursday, so 24. And double that on Friday, so 48.  

Now, if you add all them up... 3 plus 6 plus 12 plus 24 plus 48... that's 93 clouds!


93 

"
"That's a lotta pods! So, they give ya 20 more pods for the same price, right?  That's like, a whole extra load or two!  So if you get 100 washes outta the regular box, and they give ya 20 more, that's 120 washes total.  And if the box costs 12 bucks, that means you get 10 washes for every dollar.

"
"Lemme see... he took out a bunch of twenties, right?  Lost some, then used some to pay somethin'.  Then he had more money somehow, and traded it all for fives.

"Team A got 4 goals in the first part, and the other team got 2 less, so that's 2 goals. Then in the second part, the other team got 4 times more, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 goals.  Team A got half as many as that, so 8 split in half is 4.  So Team A got 4 + 4 which is 8 goals, and the other team got 2 + 8 which is 10 goals. Altogether, that's 8 + 10, which is 18 goals.

"
"Well, lemme see... He started with 5 inches, used up a bunch on Monday, and now has 2.75 inches left.  He uses a little bit each day, like a fifth of it.  So, he can use it for a couple more days before it gets too small.

"Well, lemme see...  There's 12 girls and 12 boys, so that's 24 kids total.  Some of 'em are on varsity, some ain't.  Hmm... a third of the girls and a quarter of the boys... that's tricky.  Let's see...  

If a third of the girls are on varsity, that's 4 girls. And a quarter of the boys is 3 boys. So that's 7 kids on varsity.

That means the rest ain't on varsity. 24 kids total minus 7 is... 17!

"Mike got 5 masks. Johnny got a whole lotta more! Three times Mike's masks is 15, and then 2 more on top of that... lemme see... 15 plus 2 is 17!

That's sixteen hundred gallons gone bad. And if each gallon cost three-fifty...  

*more counting*

That's five thousand six hundred dollars he got back, I reckon.

"Well, lemme see... he's got 27,000 bucks to spend, right? And he wants to split it between three schools. So that's 9,000 bucks for each school.

Now, he can get a hundred books for 500 bucks.  So if he's got 9,000 bucks, that's like 9,000 divided by 500... which is 18 sets of a hundred books.

That means each school can get 1800 books!

"Well, lemme see... He makes 20 snowballs every hour, but some melt.  He loses 2 every 15 minutes, so that's like 8 meltin' away every hour. So he's really only makin' 12 an hour.  He needs 60, so that's gonna take him 5 hours.

"
"Well, if John's 28 now and Digimon's 20 years old, that means John was 8 when it came out, right?  'Cause 28 take away 20 is 8.  And if John was twice as old as Jim back then, Jim musta been 4. So now Jim's gotta be 24, 'cause 4 plus 20 is 24.


24 

"
"Doxa ate one, her sister ate two, and her brother ate three.  That's one plus two plus three... lemme see... six!

"
"Well, lemme see... they used a bunch of bandages, then got more.  They had some left over, so they musta started with a lot!  

169 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she got two inches cut off, right? So that's 2 times 30 bucks, which is 60. Then add the 40 for the color...  

100 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she works a lot, six days a week!  That's like, almost every day!  So, she makes $1.50 every hour, and she works 7 and a half hours each day.  That's... lemme grab a pen and paper...  

Okay, so 7.5 times 1.5 is 11.25.  So she makes $11.25 every day.  And she works six days, so that's 11.25 times 6... which is 67.50.  

She makes that every week!  And April has four weeks, so that's 67.50 times 4...  

Hold on, lemme use my calculator...  

That's 270!  But wait, she gets an extra 10 bucks for coming to work every day. So it's 270 plus 10...

That's 280!


280 

"
"Lemme see... he got three bucks for doin' laundry, and a buck fifty for cleanin' his room.  He took the trash out twice, so that's a dollar fifty. And he did the dishes six times, so that's three bucks.  

Add it all up... three plus three plus one fifty plus three... that's nine dollars!


$9.00 

"
"Wow, that's a lot of blood!  So a shark has, like, three times the blood of a whale, which is already a whole bunch.  So if one shark has three times 40, that's... uh... 120 gallons! And if you got ten sharks, that's 120 times 10...  

1200 



"
"Lemme see... so 50 folks came in first, then 40 more, then double that last bunch, so that's 80. And then three times the first group, so that's 150 more.  

Add 'em all up: 50 + 40 + 80 + 150...  

That's 320 people! 


320
"
"Well, lemme see...  He got 5 packs of red ones, and twice that many black ones, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 packs of black.  That's a lotta pens!  So, 5 plus 10 is 15 packs in all.  And if each pack has 5 pens, that's 15 times 5...  carry the one...  that's 75 pens!


75 

"
"Well, lemme see... he buys ten bottles of that fancy scotch stuff for 600 bucks, right? So each bottle is 60 bucks. Now, he gets double that amount of cognac, so that's 20 bottles.  And they cost more, like 50% more... so that's 30 bucks extra per bottle. So each cognac bottle is 90 bucks.  

That's 20 bottles times 90 bucks...  carry the one... that's 1800 bucks for the cognac.

Now, add that to the scotch, 1800 plus 600... that's 2400 bucks total.

$2400 

"
"Well, lemme see... He planted 20 oak trees, and then twice that many pine trees, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 pine trees.  The next day he planted 10 more oak trees, so that's 20 plus 10, which is 30 oak trees. And he planted more pine trees, but it was a tricky amount.  He planted 10 more pine trees than the first day, so that's 40 plus 10, which is 50 pine trees.

So, all together, he planted 20 oak plus 40 pine, which is 60 trees on the first day. And then 30 oak plus 50 pine, which is 80 trees on the second day.

Now, if we add those together, 60 plus 80, we get 140 trees!

"
"Well, lemme see... Fred had a whole bunch of root beer, right?  He started with 24 gallons, but then his kids drank some, and his wife spilled some, and his buddy Ronnie took some too.  That's a lot of root beer gone!  

By the time the party came around, there was only 8 gallons left.  And there were 4 folks at the party, so they each got 2 gallons. 


2 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  They got eight more than four times the mugs, and that's 40.  So, four times the mugs is 32, right?  'Cause 40 minus 8 is 32.  Then you gotta figure out what number times four is 32... that's gotta be 8!


8
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So there's a bunch of fishies, right?  Like, sixty-six of 'em.  Some are red, some ain't.  A third of 'em are red, so that's...  *counts on fingers*  twenty-two red fishies.

That leaves a lotta fishies that ain't red, right?  So, forty-four of 'em.  And some of those are blue.  Five outta every eleven of those are blue...  *scratches head*  That's... twenty blue fishies.

So, twenty-two red ones plus twenty blue ones...  That's forty-two fishies with stripes!

"
"Let's see... she had two of them eyeshadow thingymajigs with four colors each, so that's eight. Then she had three sets with six colors each, so that's eighteen more.  That's twenty-six all together. But her sister took one of the eyeshadow thingymajigs, so that's four less.  So that's twenty-two. And she used up some from one of the sets... lemme see... half of six is three. So she has nineteen left.

"
"Well, that house is mighty tall! Seven times taller than Mattison, huh?  So that's like... a whole lotta inches.  And the first floor's ceiling is three times his height, so that's a lot of room too.  

Let's see... if the whole house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, then the second floor must be 240 inches.

**180** 



"
"Them Alphas, they found a whole bunch, like, almost 300 shells!  Then them Finders, they got a bunch too, 'bout 250.  So that leaves, lemme see... 700 minus 300 minus 250...  that's 150 shells for the Gogetters!


150 

"
"Well, lemme see... four dogs, huh?  They gotta walk a total of 12 miles, right?  'Cause 4 dogs times 3 miles each is 12.  The first three dogs walk 1, 4, and 3 miles, so that's 8 miles.  So the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"
"Well, lemme see... He got a loan for, like, 40% of his house, right? So that's 40 outta every 100 bucks his house is worth.  That's $100,000. Then he used most of it to pay off stuff he owed, like 60% of that loan. So that's 60 outta every 100 bucks of the loan, which is $60,000.  

That means he had $40,000 left over.

$40,000 

"
"Lemme see... he caught three big ol' tunas, huh?  One was 56, another 46, and the last one 26... so that's a whole lotta fish!  

If each one of them kilos is worth fifty cents, gotta add 'em all up first.  That's 56 plus 46 plus 26...  carry the one... that's 128 kilos!

Now, times that by fifty cents...  

128 times 0.50...  that's 64 bucks!  He's gonna be eatin' good tonight!


$64.00 

"
"She bought 'em for 72 bucks, and she sells 'em for a bit more, like 11 outta 8 of what she paid.  So, lemme see... 11 outta 8 of 72... that's like 99 bucks!  She makes 27 bucks profit, I reckon.


$27 

"
"Well, lemme see... he ran it on low for 3 days, so that's 3 liters, right? Then medium for 3 days, which is like double the low, so that's 6 liters. And then high for 5 days, which is double the medium, so that's 20 liters.  

Add 'em all up: 3 + 6 + 20... that's 29 liters! 


29
"
"Dang, that's a lotta balloons!  They had 10 packs with 30 in each, so that's a whole bunch, right?  30 times 10 is 300!  But they had some left over, only 12. So they threw... hmm... 300 take away 12...  

288 

"
"Well, lemme see... she needs 14 of the first one, and three times that of the other, so that's 14 times 3, which is 42.  So that's 14 plus 42, which is 56 for one dose.  Now, if she needs 8 doses, that's 56 times 8...  carry the one... that's 448!


448 

"
"Ali's class is big, holds a whole lotta kids, like 120! John's classes are smaller, like, way smaller.  Each one is like a slice of Ali's class, like if you cut it into 8 pieces. So each of John's classes is 120 divided by 8, which is 15 kids.  John has two of those small classes, so that's 15 times 2, which is 30 kids.  

Now, add Ali's big class to John's two small classes: 120 plus 30 is 150.


150 

"
"Well, lemme see... He borrowed 300 bucks, right? And he's gotta give back a little extra, 2% they said.  So that's like, 6 bucks more.  

He's payin' 25 bucks a month for 11 months, so that's 275 bucks.  

That means he still owes 31 bucks, right?  'Cause 306 minus 275 is 31.


$31 

"
"Well, lemme see... Two kids, five diapers each... that's ten diapers, right?  His wife does half, so that leaves five for Jordan.


5 

"
"Well, that jar's pretty big, ain't it?  I reckon there's gotta be a whole lotta jelly beans in there.  If they're packed in tight, maybe like 3000 or somethin'?  And if a third of 'em are red, that's gotta be around 1000 red ones, right?  But who knows, maybe there's even more!


36 

"
"Well, lemme see... the bus started with 20 folks, then picked up 40 more. That's 60 people. Then another bunch got on, 'bout half the first group, so that's 20 more. Now there's 80 people. Double that at the next stop, so that's 160.  The bus holds 200, so you need 40 more to fill it up. 


40 

"
"Well, lemme see... she goes three times a year, right? And that's two dollars each time. So that's six dollars a year.  She does that for five years, so that's six times five, which is thirty dollars.

Then the price goes up, way up!  It's like, double and a half! So now it's five dollars a visit.  She still goes three times a year, so that's fifteen dollars a year. And she does that for three more years, so that's fifteen times three, which is forty-five dollars.

Now, we gotta add the first part and the second part together. Thirty plus forty-five... that's seventy-five dollars!


75 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 10 kids in each grade, right? And only 8 can go in the room at once. So, that's like, two groups from each grade.  They got four grades, so that's eight groups total.

If each group takes 45 minutes, that's like... eight times 45...  

*counts on fingers*

That's 360 minutes! 


360 

"
"Lemme see... four tables at twenty bucks a pop... that's eighty bucks.  Then two roof frames at ten bucks each... so that's twenty more. Eighty plus twenty... hmm... that's a hundred dollars Ali owes John.


100 

"
"Well, lemme see... He's got a big ol' board, right? Forty feet long. And he wants to cut it so one piece is four times bigger than the other.  Hmm... that's tricky.  

If I cut it in half, that's twenty feet each, but that ain't four times bigger.  Gotta make the smaller piece way smaller...

Let's see... if the big piece is 32 feet, then the little piece is 8 feet.  Yep, 32 is four times bigger than 8!

32 

"
"Well, lemme see... he wants 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 from every pound of meat. So that's 80 divided by 16, which is 5 pounds of meat.  He puts two spoonfuls of that fancy seasoning in every pound, so he needs 5 times 2... that's 10 spoonfuls.


10 

"
"Lemme see... five windows, and each one's 35 inches... so that's like, 5 times 35...  carry the one...  that's 175 inches.  And he needs double that, so... 175 times 2...  

350 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so it's 25 cents a minute for the first bit, right?  That's like, 4 bucks for 16 minutes. Then it goes down to 20 cents a minute. So the rest is 20 minutes, and that's... lemme grab my calculator... 20 times 20 cents is 4 bucks too!

So, all together, it's 8 bucks.


$8.00 

"
"Well, it rained a couple inches on Monday, right?  They say tomorrow it's gonna rain more, like double what it did yesterday plus a little extra. So, double yesterday's rain is... lemme see... 2 times 2 is 4. And then a little more... so maybe 5 inches?


5 

"
"Well, lemme see... she needs enough for five folks, and they each get two things, so that's ten treats total.  She makes less brownies than cupcakes, so... hmm... maybe she made three cupcakes? 


3
"
"Okay, so she gets the nails done on her hands and feet, right? That's 35 plus 40, so 75 bucks. But they give you a deal if you do both, like 20 bucks off. So that's 75 minus 20, which is 55.  Then she wants them all fancy with the little pictures, and that's 3 bucks a nail, and she got ten fingers, so that's 30 more bucks. So all together, it's 55 plus 30, which is 85 dollars.

$85 

"
"Lemme see... she gets 3 magazines that come 12 times a year, so that's a lotta magazines!  That's 3 times 12...  carry the one... 36 magazines! Then she gets one that comes 6 times, so that's 6 more. And the last one comes 4 times as much as the 6 one, so that's 6 times 4...  24 more!  

So, 36 plus 6 plus 24...  that's 66 magazines!


66 

"
"Shelley's got a whole lotta paintings, way more than Samantha.  Samantha's got 27, and Shelley's got a dozen more than that... so that's 39!  Now, Kim's got less than Shelley, like 8 less... so Kim's gotta have 31.

"
"That toy went up a whole lotta in December!  Then they took some off in January.  Hmm, lemme see... it was $40, then went up by 80%, so that's like... a lot more. Then it went down by half.  I think it was $36 in January.


$36
"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each lesson, right?  He's got four of them, so that's 4 times $80, which is $320.  

Now, the veterans get a deal, $20 off. So they pay $60. He teaches two of them, so that's 2 times $60, which is $120.

Add those together, and he makes $320 plus $120, which is $440 for the whole day.


$440 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa numbers there.  You add 'em all up, then chop it in half... no, wait, divide by how many there are.  

So, 50 plus 80 plus...  carry the one...  that's 630. Now, nine numbers, so 630 split nine ways...  

70! 



"
"Eve had a bunch of pomelos, see?  Then she gave some to her friend. Now she only has 5 left.  She started with 20, so she musta given away 15.

"
"Well, lemme see... He had 60 apples, ate a bunch, then gave some to his sister.  That leaves him with... hmm...  27 apples.  If he sells 'em for 3 bucks a pop, that's 27 times 3...

"
"Well, if she wrote 9 books last year and that's three-quarters of this year, then this year she musta wrote a whole bunch more!  

Let's see... if 9 is three parts, then one part is 9 divided by 3, which is 3.

So, she wrote 3 books for every part, and there are 4 parts in a whole, so she wrote 3 times 4, which is 12 books this year!


12 

"
"Well, lemme see... he's drivin' 50 clicks an hour, and he's been goin' for three whole days. That's a lotta drivin'!  If it's 6000 clicks from Alaska to Texas, I reckon he's covered about... hmm...  maybe a little more than half?

"
"Well, lemme see... that little fella ate 6 grapes. His brother used a whole bunch more, like, five times as many! So that's 6 times 5, which is 30 grapes.  

Then their momma used a bunch for pies. She made 4 pies, and each one needs 12 grapes, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 grapes.

So, they used 30 plus 48, which is 78 grapes.  But they started with even more 'cause Madeline ate some first. So, it was 78 plus 6, which is 84 grapes!


84 

"
"Well, lemme see... They had 82 teachers but 13 were sick. So that leaves... hmm...  69 teachers. And they got 9 helpers. So, 69 plus 9... that's 78 teachers at school.

"
"Well, lemme see... he buys that pasta stuff for a dollar, right? And the cheddar cheese is three dollars.  Then he gets that fancy cheese, the gruyere, and that's double the cheddar, so that's six dollars.  So that's a dollar plus three plus six, which is ten bucks every week.  

Now, there's, like, fifty-two weeks in a year, so he spends ten times fifty-two...  

Hold on, lemme get my calculator...

*fumbles with a calculator*

That's five hundred and twenty dollars! 


520.00 

"
"Well, lemme see... 80 rooms times 15 minutes each... that's a lotta cleanin'!  That's 1200 minutes right there.  

They work 8 hours a day, so that's 480 minutes.  And they got 5 days, so that's 2400 minutes total.

Hmm... 1200 outta 2400... that's half! So they spend half their day cleanin'.


50 

"
"Well, lemme see... she's got two shelves in the middle that hold ten books each, so that's twenty books right there. The bottom one holds double that, so that's forty. And the top one holds five less than the bottom, so that's thirty-five.  

Altogether, that's fifty-five books per bookcase. She's got a hundred and ten books, so she needs two bookcases. 


2 

"
"Lemme see... she bought a whole lotta eggs, five of them big boxes, right?  And each box cost her two dollars and forty cents. So that's like, twelve bucks total.

Now she's gonna sell 'em three at a time for a dollar.  Hmm... so she got sixty eggs, that's twenty sets of three.  Twenty dollars she'll make!

So she spends twelve and makes twenty... that's eight dollars more!


$8.00 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Half of a hundred is fifty, right? So he's got fifty red ones.  That leaves fifty left.  Uh... three-fifths of fifty...  that's thirty blue ones.  So that means he's gotta have twenty white ones.


20 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  He gets 30 sticks for 18 bucks, but it's 3 bucks cheaper... so that's 15 bucks.  

Now, 15 bucks for 30 sticks...  That's like, 50 cents a stick, I think. 


50
"
"Hmm, lemme see... so she needs to get 7 outta 10 right on each test, right?  She already did the first one, so she needs to get 35 right on the second one.


35 

"
"She made a whole lotta blueberry cubes!  Lemme see... she made 20 strawberry ones, and for every one of them she made five blueberry ones, but then took away four. So that's 20 times 5, which is 100, then take away 4... that's 96 blueberry cubes!


96 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she played a lotta games, 40 each year for four years. That's like, a whole bunch!  If she gets 21 points each time, that's gotta be a lot of points too.  

Let's see... 4 years times 40 games... that's 160 games!  And 160 times 21...  carry the one...  

3360!  That's a lotta points!


3360 

"
"Well, he started with ten, dropped half... that's like five. He found three, so that's five again. But then one wasn't even a marble, so he only got four left.

"
"Well, lemme see... he needs to sell 15 cars, right? And for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes in.  So, that's 15 times 25...  carry the one... that's 375 calls, but wait...  

He needs TWO people to come in for each car sold. So, that's 15 times 2... 30 people gotta come in.

So, 30 times 25...  that's 750 calls! 


750 

"
"Well, lemme see... they got 4 folks in the house, right? And each one gets a flashlight, so that's 4. Then they got 8 rooms, and each room needs 2 flashlights, so that's 16 more.  

Now, the candles... some rooms got 4 little candles, some got 5 bigger ones.  Hmm, that's a lotta candles! Let's say they got 4 rooms with the little ones, that's 16 little candles. And the other 4 rooms got the bigger ones, so that's 20 of them.

So, all together, they got 16 little candles plus 20 big ones, that's 36 candles. And don't forget the flashlights, 4 plus 16 is 20.

So, they got 36 candles and 20 flashlights, that's a whole lotta light!

"
"Well, lemme see... Two bags of chips, huh? That's a lotta chips!  He's got five mouths to feed, so if ya split 'em up even, each person gets 22 chips.

"
"Lemme see... so he takes 5 minutes for the first one. Then the next two take double, so that's 10 minutes each.  That's 20 minutes already. Then the last two are half the first one, so 2.5 minutes each.  So that's another 5 minutes.  

20 + 5 = 25 minutes, I think.

25 



"
"Well, lemme see... he had 20 helmets, and half as many robots, so that's 10 robots. And then he had twice as many footballs as helmets, so that's 40 footballs.  

So, 10 robots plus 20 helmets plus 40 footballs... that's 70 things in all.


70 

"
"Well, lemme see... He works 6 hours a day, and that's like, a whole lotta time.  If each call takes him 15 minutes, that's like, a quarter of an hour. So, in an hour he does 4 calls, right?  

So, in 6 hours, he does 6 times 4, which is 24 calls a day.  And if he works 5 days a week, that's 24 times 5...  

Hold on, lemme count that on my fingers...  

That's 120 calls! 


120 

"
"Well, lemme see... the old stuff dried in 7 minutes, and she's got 6 paintings. So that's 7 times 6... hmm... carry the one... that's 42 minutes.

Now the new stuff takes 12 minutes a pop. So 12 times 6... that's 72 minutes.

Now we gotta see how much longer the new stuff takes. 72 minus 42... that's 30 minutes longer.


30 

"
"Lemme see... she's got twenty plants, right? Some need half a cup, some need a whole cup, and the rest need a quarter cup.  

Okay, so that's four plants at half a cup, that's two cups. Then eight plants need a whole cup each, so that's eight cups.  

That leaves eight plants needin' a quarter cup.  That's like two cups total for them.

So, add it all up: two plus eight plus two... that's twelve cups!


12 

"
"Well, that frog's in a pickle!  He goes 20 yards a minute hoppin', but only 10 yards a minute swimmin'.  Half the way is hoppin', so that's 100 yards, and that'll take him 5 minutes. The other half is swimmin', so that's another 100 yards, and that'll take him 10 minutes.  

So, 5 minutes plus 10 minutes... that's 15 minutes to get home.

15 

"
"Lemme see... he needs 56 of them sticks, and they come 8 in a pack.  So that's... hmm... 56 divided by 8...  carry the one...  that's 7 packs he needs.  

If each pack is 2 bucks, then 7 packs is... 7 times 2...  

$14.00 

"
"Well, the main phone is twenty bucks, right? And the other ones are half that, so ten bucks each.  There's four of them extra phones, so that's forty bucks more.  Twenty plus forty... that's sixty bucks total.

"Well, lemme see... he makes a whole lotta doughnuts, that's for sure! Ten dozen is like, a hundred and twenty doughnuts, right? And he sells 'em for two bucks a pop. So that's two hundred and forty bucks a day.  Now, June has thirty days, so... carry the one... that's seven thousand two hundred bucks!

$7200 

"
"Lemme see... she takes 210 pictures and puts up 7 at a time, 6 times a day...  That's 7 times 6, which is 42 pictures a day. So, 210 pictures divided by 42 pictures a day...  

5 days 

"
"Lemme see... she takes five shirts, two pants, and a skirt every week.  Shirts cost five bucks a pop, pants are eight bucks, and the skirt's six. So that's... lemme add that up... 25 plus 16 plus 6... that's 47 bucks every week.

Now, she does this for five weeks, so it's 47 times five...  

Hold on, lemme get a pen and paper...

That's 235 bucks!


$235.00

"
"Well, lemme see... Conor saw 50 folks on the first day. Then 20 more showed up the next day, so that's 50 plus 20, which is 70.  The third day was busy, twice as many as the day before, so that's 70 times 2, makin' it 140.  The rest of the week he saw 60 each day, and there's four more days, so that's 60 times 4, which is 240.

Now, to get the total, we gotta add 'em all up: 50 plus 70 plus 140 plus 240.  That's... 500 people!


500 

"
"Well, lemme see... he starts with 20, then gets 3 times that, so that's 60 more. Then 4 times the first amount, so that's 80. Then half of that last bunch, so 40. And then some more pop after he takes it off the heat, so maybe another 10?  

Let's see... 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10...  

That's 210 pieces!

"
"Lemme see... he needs 4 gallons of that lemonade stuff, and each one takes a whole cup of lemon juice.  And 6 lemons make a cup, right? So that's 4 times 6, which is 24 lemons.  But then his buddy wants an extra gallon, and that one's gotta be extra sour, so he needs twice as many lemons for that one.  So that's another 12 lemons.  

24 plus 12...  that's 36 lemons!


36 

"
"Lemme see... them German Shepherds are big eaters, they gobble up 5 bags a day each.  And them Bulldogs, they ain't so bad, just 3 bags each. So that's 15 bags for the Shepherds and 6 for the Bulldogs, makin' 21 bags a day.  Now, a week's got 7 days, so that's 21 times 7...  carry the one...  that's 147 bags!


147 

"
"Hmm, lemme see... ten of them got two legs each, so that's twenty. And fifteen got four legs, so that's sixty.  

20 + 60 = 80

80 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Got 4 blue ones, and then double that's 8 yellow ones. So that's 12 already.  That leaves 20 red ones, I reckon.

"
"Well, he drove west for a while, then turned around and drove east longer.  He was goin' 18 miles an hour the whole time.  So, I reckon he's gotta be a good ways east of his house.

"
"Well, lemme see... that boat cost a pretty penny at first, nine thousand bucks!  

First year, it lost a third of its value, so that's... uh... three thousand dollars gone.  Leaves ya with six thousand three hundred.

Second year, another third gone... so that's another eighteen hundred ninety dollars less. Now it's worth four thousand four hundred and ten.

Last year, it only lost twenty percent, so that's... lemme see... eight hundred and eighty-two dollars less.

So, after all that, the boat's worth... three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight dollars.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  Lotsa candy!  So they got 54 red ones, and then double that's orange, so that's... lemme count on my fingers... 108 orange.  And half the reds are yellow, so that's 27 yellow.  

That's a lotta candy already!  54 plus 108 plus 27...  carry the one... that's 189 candies.

So if there's 232 total, that means there's 232 minus 189...  

43 pink ones!

"
"Hmm, lemme see... she stayed in the hotel for three nights, and each night cost eighty bucks, so that's... eighty times three... two hundred and forty dollars!

And she took the bus seven times. Each bus ride was ten percent of the hotel price, so that's eight dollars a ride. Seven times eight... that's fifty-six dollars.

So, all together, it cost her two hundred and forty plus fifty-six... two hundred and ninety-six dollars!


296 

"
"Well, lemme see... Mazie had a whole bunch of marbles, right?  Fifty-two! And she gave some to Dallas, but he lost some.  He only has 21 now, but he said he lost 4. So, he musta had 25 from Mazie. That means Darla got the rest, so that's 52 minus 25...

"
"Two grownups tickets cost twelve dollars each, so that's twenty-four dollars. The little one's ticket is eight bucks.  Popcorn is three dollars each, and they got two, so that's six dollars.

"
"Hmm, lemme see... so the car's heavy, right?  Like a thousand somethin' pounds. And then there's all that stuff inside, plus the little ones.  Gotta be, what, another couple hundred pounds easy.  So, if it takes one percent of all that weight to move it... that's gotta be like... sixteen pounds, maybe?

"
"Well, lemme see... he's gotta go all the way around the fence, right? So, that's like, 20 feet that way, then 15 feet that way, then 20 feet back, and then 15 feet back to where he started.  

So, 20 plus 15 plus 20 plus 15... hmm... that's 70 feet!


70 

"
"Well, lemme see... Mia's 40, and they're 16 years apart, so Emma's gotta be 56.  That's 40 plus 16.  So, to find the average, you add 'em up, 40 plus 56, that's 96. Then you cut that in half, 'cause there's two of 'em. 96 divided by 2 is 48.

"
"They found a whole bunch of shells!  Let's see... 214 plus 432 plus 86 is... uh...  carry the one...  732 shells! But some were busted, 67 of 'em. So that's 732 minus 67...  

665 

"
"Lemme see... she needs one of each plate for each person, right? So that's 3 things per person.  She's got 12 people comin' over.  

So, 3 times 12 is 36 things she needs to buy.

Now, the big plates are 6 bucks each, the little ones are 4, and the bowls are 5.  That's 15 bucks for each set of dishes.

So, 15 times 12 is...  carry the one... 180 bucks!

"Steve took a long time, 10 hours!  Anna's faster though. Half of Steve's time is 5 hours, and she took 2 more hours than that. So, lemme see... 5 plus 2 is 7.

"
"Well, lemme see... he's got five piggies, and they each eat a whole lotta food, like 4 pounds at a time, twice a day. That's 8 pounds a day for each pig!  So all five pigs eat 40 pounds a day. In a whole week, that's 280 pounds. He started with 300, so he's got 20 pounds left over.

"
"Lemme see... 20 folks times 2 hot dogs each... that's a lotta hot dogs!  He's gotta get 40 of 'em.  He's got 4 already, so he needs 36 more.  Those packs got 6 in 'em, so that's 6 packs he needs.  If each pack is 2 bucks, that's 6 times 2...

"Let's see... she sells 20 cupcakes for 2 bucks a pop, so that's 40 bucks right there. Then she sells 40 cookies for a dollar each, so that's another 40 bucks.  That's 80 bucks total. But she spent 20 bucks on them trays. So she got 60 bucks left.


$60 

"
"Well, lemme see...  They start with 5 kids, then each gets another friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10. Then they get two more each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20. But then the first 5 kids leave, so that's 20 minus 5...  

15 

"
"Let's see... she had a whole bunch of meals, right?  She gave out some each day, so we gotta take those away.  

Hmmm... 1360 minus 64, then minus 30, then minus 48...  

That's a lot of subtractin'!  

1218 meals left. 



"
"Lemme see... a quarter is 25 cents, right? And two nickels is 10 cents, 'cause each one is 5.  Then there's them dimes, seven of 'em... that's 70 cents, 'cause each dime is 10.

So, 25 plus 10 plus 70... that's 105 cents.

"
"Well, lemme see... there's two boys and three girls. The girls are all the same age, sixteen. One boy is twelve, and the other one is twice that, so he's twenty-four.  

So, that's twelve plus twenty-four plus forty-eight...  

84 

"
"Well, lemme see... she meditates for 15 minutes in the mornin' and 15 at night, so that's 30 minutes a day.  And she does that every day. Yoga's an hour, but only 5 days a week. So that's 5 hours of yoga a week.  

Hmm, 30 minutes a day times 7 days is 210 minutes for meditation.  And 5 hours of yoga is 300 minutes.  So that's 510 minutes a week all together.

Now, 4 weeks is... lemme count... 4 times 510 is 2040.

"Lemme see... she's got a lotta shirts!  

So, the little ones are 3 squares each, and she's got 11 of them. That's 33 squares.

The medium ones are 4 squares each, and she's got 8 of those. That's 32 squares.

The big ones are 6 squares each, and she's got 6 of them. That's 36 squares.

Now, add 'em all up: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 squares.

"
"Well, lemme see... a dozen's 12, right? So 3 dozen is 3 times that, which is 36 seeds.  That big sunflower has a whole lotta more, like, half again as much. So that's... hmm... 36 plus half of 36...  That's 18 more. So the big one has 54.  

Now, all together... 36 plus 54... that's 90 seeds!

"
"Timmy's got a whole lotta pens, like three times more than George!  And Sarah, she's got half as many as Timmy.  George has 18, so Timmy's got 18 times 3, which is 54.  Sarah's got half of that, so she's got 54 split in half, which is 27.

"
"Well, lemme see... Anne's a whole lot taller than Albert, 'cause she's twice his size.  Albert's 36 inches, so Anne's gotta be 72 inches. Jackie's a little shorter than Anne, by 2 inches, so she's 70 inches now. But she grew 3 inches over the summer, so before that she was 67 inches.

Twelve plus twenty-four... that's thirty-six bucks all together.

"
"Lemme see... he gets 6 bucks a week for doin' chores, right? And he did that for 3 weeks, so that's 6 times 3, which is 18 bucks. Then he spent some on ice cream, 1.25 for each of them, and there were 4 of 'em, so that's 1.25 times 4, which is 5 bucks.  So he's got 18 minus 5, which is 13 bucks left.  Movie tickets cost 6.50 each, so he can get 13 divided by 6.50... hmm, that's 2 tickets.

"Lemme see... Ellen got some leggings for a hundred bucks and a picture thing for five bucks. That's a hundred and five, right?

"Lemme see... so he uses 2 pounds of that fancy fruit, whatchamacallit, passion fruit, and that costs 6 bucks a pound. So that's 2 times 6, which is 12 bucks. Then he uses some jackfruit, 1.5 pounds, and that's 8 bucks a pound, so that's 1.5 times 8, which is 12 bucks too. And then there's the honey, 2 pounds of that at 10 bucks a pound, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 bucks.

So all together, the stuff to make one jar costs 12 plus 12 plus 20, which is 44 bucks. He sells it for 50 bucks, so he makes 50 minus 44, which is 6 bucks profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes 6 times 10, which is 60 bucks!
