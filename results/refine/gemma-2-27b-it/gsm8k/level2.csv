"Ah, a classic download interruption problem! These can be tricky, but with a bit of rate and percentage calculation, we can easily solve it.

First, we need to figure out how much data was downloaded before the interruption. 40% of the 200 GB file is 80 GB.

Since the download speed is a constant 2 GB per minute, it took 40 minutes to download that initial 80 GB (80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes).

Now, factor in the 20-minute restart delay.

Finally, Carla has to download the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB), which will take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 60 minutes (remaining download) = 120 minutes.

"Let's analyze this problem step-by-step using the distance-rate-time relationship:

* **Outbound Trip:** Distance = Rate * Time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

* **Return Trip:**

    *  The first 2 hours are spent in traffic, covering no distance.
    *  The next 0.5 hours are driven at 30 mph, covering 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
    *  The remaining time is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
    *  The distance covered at 80 mph is 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.
    *  Total distance covered in the return trip is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

* **Final Distance from Home:**  The final distance from home is the initial distance minus the distance covered on the return trip: 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

"From a geometric perspective, we can view the trains' journeys as two legs of a right triangle. The westward travel forms one leg, the northward travel forms the other, and the total distance traveled represents the hypotenuse.  

Since the legs are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance: a² + b² = c²

In this case, a = 80 miles and b = 150 miles.

Therefore: 80² + 150² = c²

6400 + 22500 = c²

The total cost for the last six months is 6 months * $126/month = $756.

Finally, to find the total cost for the entire year, we add the costs for both halves: $840 + $756 = $1596.

Now, the hospital's expenses are 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000. Their revenue is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Therefore, the hospital's profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

*  *q + b + w = 700* (Total bees)
*  *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
*  *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

We can solve for 'w' (the number of worker bees) through substitution:

1. **Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the equation *w = 2b*:** This gives us *w = 2 * (2q) = 4q*.

2. **Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the equation *q + b + w = 700*:** This results in *q + 2q + 4q = 700*.

"Ah, a classic tree population problem!  Let's break it down.

First, we need to determine the net change in trees over the 10 years. Tom plants 10 trees per year and removes 2, for a net gain of 8 trees annually. Over a decade, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.

Adding this to his starting amount, he'd have 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

Finally, we factor in the 30% loss.  That means 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees perish.

Subtracting this loss leaves him with 130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

Substituting 'a' into the third equation, we get: b = 44 + 4 = 48.

Andrea has half the number of bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Therefore, there are a total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Ah, a classic real estate problem involving percentages!  

Let's break it down. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so that's $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

Adding those together, the total additional costs are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

Therefore, the total price of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

"Ah, a classic real estate calculation!  

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to factor in both the percentage-based fees and the outstanding loan.

* **Transfer Fees:** 3% of $400,000 is a straightforward calculation: 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.
* **Brokerage Fees:** Similarly, 5% of $400,000 is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.
* **Total Fees:** Adding the transfer and brokerage fees, we get $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.
* **Total Expenses:**  Including the loan repayment, Mr. Tan's total expenses are $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.
* **Net Proceeds:** Finally, subtracting the total expenses from the selling price gives us $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"Ah, a classic time calculation with a percentage twist!  

Let's break it down.  

The oil takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees than 300 degrees, which is an additional 20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes.

That means the total heating time is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

Since cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Combining like terms, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

"Let's denote the number of cows as 'c' and the number of chickens as 'h'. We're given two key pieces of information:

*  The total number of animals is 60:  c + h = 60
* The number of chickens is twice the number of cows: h = 2c

Now we can use substitution to solve for our variables. Substitute the second equation into the first:

c + 2c = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3c = 60

Dividing both sides by 3:

c = 20

This means there are 20 cows.  Substituting this back into h = 2c, we find:

h = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Finally, to calculate the total number of legs:

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost x - 6 dollars.
* The total original cost of both pairs of jeans is x + (x - 6) = 2x - 6.
* Cole saved a total of $6, so the sale price of both pairs is 2x - 6 - 6 = 2x - 12.
* He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is (1/3) * 6 = 2 dollars.
* This means he saved 4 dollars on the tattered jeans.

Now we can set up an equation to find the original price of the jogger jeans:

x - 6 + 2 = x  

Solving for x, we get:

x = 28

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost 28 - 6 = $22.

The difference in original prices is 28 - 22 = $6.

"Let's denote Jame's current age as  'j' and his cousin's current age as 'c'.

We know:

* j + 5 = 27  (Jame's age in 5 years)
* c + 8 = 2j - 5 (Cousin's age in 8 years)

Solving the first equation for j, we get:

j = 22

Substituting this value into the second equation:

c + 8 = 2(22) - 5
c + 8 = 39
c = 31

Therefore, the difference in their ages is:

31 - 22 = 9

"Ah, a classic tire wear problem!  

We can solve this with a bit of dimensional analysis.  

First, we need to determine the total rotations the tire experiences in a month:

400 miles/month * (725 rotations / 2 miles) = 145,000 rotations/month

Now, we divide the tire's total rotation capacity by the monthly rotations to find the lifespan in months:

10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months

Finally, we convert months to years:

72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years

"Ah, a classic discount problem!  Let's break it down. A 30% discount on the shirt means we multiply the original price by 0.30 to find the savings: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50.  

The sale price of the shirt is then $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

We do the same for the shorts: $35 * 0.30 = $10.50 discount, making the sale price $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Adding those together, the total cost is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

Finally, subtracting that from Joe's initial $50, he'll have $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left.

"Let's break this down. We need to determine the number of days it takes for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches (20 feet) to 600 inches.

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.  The difference in height needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Therefore, it will take 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

* S = M + 23

We need to find the total number of cookies, which is K + M + C + S.

1. **Find Max's cookies (M):** Since K = M - 5 and K = 68, we know M = 68 + 5 = 73.

2. **Find the Cookie Monster's cookies (C):**  We know M = C + 12 and M = 73, so C = 73 - 12 = 61.

3. **Find Summer's cookies (S):** We know S = M + 23 and M = 73, so S = 73 + 23 = 96.

4. **Calculate the total:** K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

"Let's denote the age of each twin as 't' and the age of each triplet as 'r'. We're given the following system of equations:

1.  t = r + 7  (One twin is 7 years older than one triplet)
2.  2t + 3r = 44 (Their combined ages are 44)

We can solve for 't' using substitution. Substitute the first equation into the second:

2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Simplify and solve for 'r':

2r + 14 + 3r = 44
5r + 14 = 44
5r = 30
r = 6

Now, substitute the value of 'r' back into the equation t = r + 7:

t = 6 + 7
t = 13 


Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

"Let's use algebra to solve this problem.

* Let 'x' represent the cost of one lollipop and 'y' represent the cost of one candy.

We know the following:

* 5x + 4y = 3.20  (The cost of 5 lollipops and 4 candies is $3.20)
* x = 0.40 (Each lollipop costs $0.40)

Now we can substitute the value of 'x' into the first equation:

* 5(0.40) + 4y = 3.20

Simplify and solve for 'y':

* 2 + 4y = 3.20
* 4y = 1.20
* y = 0.30

So, one candy costs $0.30.

Now we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

* 10x + 10y = 10(0.40) + 10(0.30) = 4 + 3 = 7.00

"Ah, a classic problem involving percentages and basic arithmetic! Let's break it down.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and we know the vaccines cost $40.  This means the $40 represents 40% of the total cost (100% - 60% = 40%).

If $40 represents 40%, we can find 1% by dividing: $40 / 40% = $1.

* The first set of flowers contributes 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals.
* The second set adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.
* The third set adds 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.

"Let's break down this arcade spending problem.

First, we need to standardize everyone's playtime to quarters.  Jack gets 20 minutes per quarter. His less-skilled friends manage half that, or 10 minutes per quarter. His more-skilled friend gets 1.5 times Jack's time, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

Since they play for 4 hours, that's 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes total.

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

* **Jack:** 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* **Less-skilled friends:** 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each, for a total of 2 * 24 = 48 quarters
* **More-skilled friend:** 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Adding those up, they use a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Finally, at $0.25 per quarter, their total spending is 68 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically. 

We'll use the following variables:

*  *z* = ounces of zest
*  *f* = ounces of fragrance
*  *s* = ounces of salt
*  *o* = ounces of oil
*  *su* = ounces of sugar

We know the following relationships:

* *f = z* (same amount of fragrance as zest)
* *s = 2z* (twice as much salt as zest)
* *o = 2s* (twice as much oil as salt)
* *su = s* (same amount of sugar as salt)

The total weight of the scrub is 10 ounces: *z + f + s + o + su = 10*

Now we can substitute to express everything in terms of *z*:

* *z + z + 2z + 2(2z) + 2z = 10*

Combining like terms:

* *10z = 10*

Solving for *z*:

* *z = 1*

Finally, we can find the amount of oil:

* *o = 2s = 2(2z) = 2(2 * 1) = 4*

* **Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 2x = 0.4x cars.**
* **Joe gives his mother twice the number he sold, so he gives her 2 * 0.4x = 0.8x cars.**
* **In total, Joe gives away 0.4x + 0.8x = 1.2x cars.**
* **We know Robert has 20 cars, so x = 20.**
* **Therefore, Joe gives away 1.2 * 20 = 24 cars.**
* **Joe started with 2 * 20 = 40 cars and gave away 24, leaving him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.**

"Ah, a classic profit and loss problem!  Let's break it down.

Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  That means his total earnings need to be $2000 (profit) + the cost of the chickens.

He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens.

His total earnings from the sale will be 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Therefore, the cost of the chickens he took to market is $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"Let Melanie's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.  We know that in 10 years, she will be 18, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving for x, we find that Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We want to find out when her age will be three times her current age, or 3x.  This can be represented by the equation:

x + y = 3x

Where 'y' is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her current age.

Substituting x = 8, we get:

8 + y = 24

Solving for y, we find:

y = 16

"Let's analyze Kelly's grocery expenses:

* **Chicken cost:** Each chicken packet costs twice the price of a bacon pack, which is $10 / 5 = $2.  Therefore, each chicken packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.
* **Total chicken cost:** 6 chicken packets cost $4 * 6 = $24.
* **Apple cost:** Each apple pack costs half the price of a strawberry pack, which is $4 / 2 = $2.
* **Total apple cost:** 7 apple packs cost $2 * 7 = $14.
* **Strawberry cost:** 3 strawberry packs cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Summing all the costs, we get $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Since Kelly's budget is $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 remaining.

"Ah, a classic tank-filling problem! Let's break it down.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank on the first day, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 the amount Wanda did, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

Together, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her Day 1 amount, which is (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her Day 1 amount, which is (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

That's another 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

The tank still needs 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons to be full.

"Let's break this problem down using algebraic reasoning and our understanding of percentages.

* Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.

* After the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 45% of its charge, leaving it with (100 - 45)% = 55% of its original charge.

* In the next 3 hours, it loses another 21%, meaning it retains 55% - 21% = 34% of its original charge.

* We know this 34% represents the charge *before* Maria's friends used it.  Since the final charge is 28%, her friends used 34% - 28% = 6% of the original charge.

*  We can set up a proportion to find the original charge (x): 6% / 34% =  x / 100%

* Solving for x, we get x = (6% * 100%) / 34% = 17.65% (approximately)

"Ah, a classic productivity problem!  Let's break it down.

A steel pickaxe increases a dwarf's output by 50% compared to an iron pickaxe. That means a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 150% of what they mine with an iron pickaxe.

Since an iron pickaxe doubles a dwarf's output from bare hands (12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds), a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 24 pounds * 1.50 = 36 pounds per day.

Over a 30-day month, a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, the total output becomes 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds.

"Ah, a classic inventory and sales problem! Let's break it down.

* Trekking bikes make up 50% of sales, so Marcel sold 300 bikes * 0.50 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* BMX bikes represent 15% of sales, meaning he sold 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

Now for the revenue:

* Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250 (remember, BMX bikes are half the price of MTBs!)

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
* Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.

We know the following:

* A = M  (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)
* C + S = 30 (Camden and Sarah's total)
* C = S + 12 (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)
* A + M + C + S = 56 (Total eggs painted)

We can solve for C (Camden's eggs) and then find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs.

From the equation C = S + 12, we can substitute into the equation C + S = 30:

(S + 12) + S = 30
2S + 12 = 30
2S = 18
S = 9

Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs.  We can find Camden's eggs:

C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total - 30 painted by Camden and Sarah), each painted 13 eggs.

Finally, the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is:

"Ah, a classic livestock accumulation problem!  

Let's break it down:

* **Cows:** We start with 50 and gain 20 per day for 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days/week), totaling 420 new cows (20 * 21 = 420). That brings the total cow count to 470 (50 + 420).

* **Chickens:** We begin with 20 and receive 10 more each day for 21 days, adding 210 chickens (10 * 21 = 210). This gives us a total of 230 chickens (20 + 210).

* **Grand Total:** Adding the cows and chickens, we have a total of 700 animals (470 + 230).

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let 'x' represent the number of individual sunflowers sold.
* Let 'y' represent the number of bouquets sold.

We know the following:

*  2x + 8y = 82 (Total earnings from sunflowers and bouquets over 3 days)
*  y * 12 =  number of sunflowers in bouquets 

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is x + 12y.

We need to solve for x.  To do this, we can use the first equation to express 'y' in terms of 'x':

* 8y = 82 - 2x
* y = (82 - 2x) / 8

Now, substitute this value of 'y' into the expression for the total number of sunflowers:

* x + 12 * ((82 - 2x) / 8)

Simplify and solve for x. Since we're dealing with whole sunflowers, round down to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

*  Let 'r' be the length of the red rope.
*  Let 'b' be the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' be the length of the yellow rope.

We're given the following relationships:

1. r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
2. b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
3. r + b + y = 37 (The total length of the ropes is 37 centimeters)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r'.

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
r = 4(y - 7)

Simplify:
r = 4y - 28

Substitute both this simplified equation for 'r' and equation (2) into equation (3):
(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

Combine like terms:
6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
y = 12

Now that we know y = 12, substitute it back into equation (2) to find 'b':
b = 12 - 7
b = 5

Finally, substitute the value of 'b' into the equation r = 4b:
r = 4 * 5
r = 20

"Ah, a classic problem involving proportional reasoning and percentage increases! Let's break it down:

The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch, which means each bottle of cognac is priced at 150% of the scotch's price.  

*  Since the scotch costs $60 per bottle, the cognac costs $60 * 1.50 = $90 per bottle.

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he purchases 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

His total cognac expenditure is then 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

Adding the cost of the scotch, his total spending is $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Let's analyze the popcorn popping pattern:

* **Phase 1:** 20 kernels pop.
* **Phase 2:** The rate triples, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Phase 3:** The rate quadruples from the initial rate, meaning 20 * 4 = 80 kernels pop.
* **Phase 4:** The rate halves from the previous phase, resulting in 80 / 2 = 40 kernels popping.
* **Residual Heat:** A quarter of the Phase 4 amount pops, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels pop.

Summing all the phases: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"Ah, a classic depreciation problem!  Let's break it down.

The boat loses 30% of its value in the first year, which is a depreciation of $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. This leaves the boat worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciates another 30%, or $6300 * 0.30 = $1890. The value is now $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, the depreciation is 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.
