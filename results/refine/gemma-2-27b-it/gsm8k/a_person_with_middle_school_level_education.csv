"Okay, so Janet starts with 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs gone.  That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.

If she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market.


$18 

"
"Okay, so the robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.  It also needs half that amount of white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt.

So in total, it needs 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fiber.

"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 fixing it up. That's a total of $130,000 spent.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, which means it's now worth 1.5 times what it was before. So, it went up in value by $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.

That means the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


$70,000
"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints three times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters.  

To find out how many meters he runs in a week, we gotta multiply:

3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints/week

Then multiply that by how far he runs each sprint:

9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters/week

"
"Okay, so Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day.  She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's 40 cups total.

If she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs 60 cups in total.

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the last meal. 


20
"
"Okay, so Kylar's buying a bunch of glasses.  Every other one is cheaper, which is cool.

Since he's getting 16 glasses, that's like 8 pairs. Each pair has one regular price glass for $5 and one on sale for 60% of $5, which is $3.

So each pair costs $5 + $3 = $8.

He's buying 8 pairs, so it'll cost him $8 x 8 = $64.


$64 

"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times that amount, so they have 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, meaning they have 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.


260 

"
"Okay, so Carla was downloading a big file, 200 GB. She usually downloads 2 GB every minute.  She got 40% of the way done, which is like 80 GB, but then her computer had to restart for updates. That took 20 minutes, and she had to start all over!

So, she downloaded 80 GB in 40 minutes (80 divided by 2). Then she had 120 GB left to download, which would take 60 minutes (120 divided by 2).

In total, it took her 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes to download the whole thing.


120 

"
"Okay, so John drove 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he went 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Then he had to turn around and go back. He was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he didn't go anywhere during that time.

After the traffic, he drove 30 miles per hour for half an hour, which is 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

He had 1.5 hours left to drive fast, and he was going 80 miles per hour, so he went 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

So in total, he drove 15 + 120 = 135 miles on the way back.

That means he was 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home. 



45
"
"Okay, so Eliza gets paid $10 an hour for her regular work. She worked 40 hours like that, so that's 40 times 10, which is $400.

Then she worked 5 extra hours, and those are overtime. Overtime is 1.2 times her regular pay, so that's $10 times 1.2, which is $12 an hour.

For her overtime, she made 5 hours times $12 an hour, which is $60.

To find her total, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.


$460 

"
"Okay, so the program got 60 downloads the first month. Then it got three times that much the next month, which is 60 times 3, or 180 downloads.  But then the third month it went down by 30% of the second month's downloads.  That's 180 times 0.30, which is 54 downloads less. So the third month had 180 minus 54, which is 126 downloads.

To find the total, we add up all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.


366 

"
"Okay, so Toula bought a lot of yummy treats! Let's see...

* Donuts: 3 dozen times $68 each is $204.
* Cupcakes: 2 dozen times $80 each is $160.
* Cheesecakes: 6 dozen times $55 each is $330.

Now, to find the total, we add those all up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694


694 

"
"Okay, so the tree costs $90 at first.  Then every year he makes $10.50 from selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but it costs $3 to take care of it. So he makes $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).

To figure out how long it takes to make back the $90, we divide: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


12 

"
"Okay, so Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Let's work backwards.

She sold half her vacuums at the orange house, so before that she had 5 x 2 = 10 vacuums.

Then she sold 2 to the red house, so she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuums.

Finally, she sold a third of her vacuums at the green house. That means the 12 vacuums represent two-thirds of her starting amount.

If 12 is two-thirds, then one-third is 12 / 2 = 6 vacuums.

So, she started with 6 x 3 = 18 vacuums.


**Answer:** 18 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class.  20% like contemporary dance, so that's 20 * 0.20 = 4 kids.

That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 kids.

Then 25% of those kids like jazz, so that's 16 * 0.25 = 4 kids.

That means 16 - 4 = 12 kids like hip-hop.

So, 12 out of 20 kids like hip-hop, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so the merchant wants to make more money, right?

Let's see... the jewelry will be worth $5000 + (2.5% of $5000) which is $125 more.

The gadgets will be worth $8000 + (1.2% of $8000) which is $96 more.

So, the jewelry will make him $125 more, which is better!


Answer: 125 

"
"Okay, so the trains each go 80 miles one way and then 150 miles another way.  To find the total distance, we just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 each hour teaching and she teaches for 35 hours every week. That means she makes $20 x 35 = $700 each week teaching.

She also makes $30 an hour coaching and does that for 15 hours a week, so she makes $30 x 15 = $450 each week coaching.

To find out how much she makes in total each week, we add those together: $700 + $450 = $1150.

Since there are 50 weeks in a year, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50: $1150 x 50 = $57500.


57500 

"
"Okay, so she eats 3 eggs every day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 x 7 = 21 eggs a week.

Then over 4 weeks, she eats 21 x 4 = 84 eggs.

There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so she eats 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.


7 

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to hike 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.  That means the whole hike should take 3 hours (12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours).

She already hiked for 2 hours, so she only has 1 hour left (3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour).

She needs to hike the last 6 miles in that hour, so she needs to go 6 miles per hour (6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour).


6 

"
"Okay, so we start with 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of it is water, so that's 10 times 2/3 which is 6.67 liters of water.

Then we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, so that's 15 times 3/5 which is 9 liters of water.

Oops, I spilled a liter of the orange drink, so now there's only 9 liters left.

Now we add the water from both drinks: 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters of water.


15.67 

"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and her cousin Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.


14 

"
"Okay, so Billy sold DVDs to some of his customers.  Let's see... the first three people each bought one, so that's 3 DVDs. Then two more people bought two each, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 more DVDs.  

So in total, he sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

"
"The candle burns for 4 hours.  It melts 2 centimeters every hour, so it will be 4 * 2 = 8 centimeters shorter.

8 

"
"Okay, so the book is on sale for $19.50, and that's 25% off the original price.  That means $19.50 is 75% of the original price. To find the original price, I can think of it like this:

If 75% is equal to $19.50, then 1% is equal to $19.50 divided by 75, which is $0.26.

Since 1% is $0.26, then 100% (the whole original price) is $0.26 times 100, which is $26.00.


$26.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs x $3), and $6 on apples (4 apples x $1.50). That's a total of $33.

If she paid $50, then the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33).

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50).


2 

"
"Okay, so Mishka bought 3 of each thing, right?

* Shorts cost $16.50 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $16.50 = $49.50
* Pants are $22.50 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $22.50 = $67.50
* Shoes are $42 each, so 3 pairs cost 3 * $42 = $126.00

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


243.00 

"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, that's 60 servings of ice cream. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 / 15 = 4).  If each carton costs $4.00, then she'll spend $16.00 in total (4 x $4.00 = $16.00).


16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry biked 20 miles then stopped.  Then he biked some more until he was 15 miles from the end, which is at 45 miles.  

So he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.


25 

"
"Okay, so the cheaper heels cost $33. The other heels cost twice that, so they're $33 x 2 = $66.  

Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

The boots cost $5 more than the heels, so they are $99 + $5 = $104.


$104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like parts of a pie. Darrell's part is 7 and Allen's is 11, and those parts add up to 18.  

We know their total age is 162, so we divide that by 18 to see how big each ""part"" is: 162 / 18 = 9.

That means Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Okay, so Gunter's friends are guessing how many jelly beans are in the jar.

* The first friend says 80.
* The second friend says 20 more than half of 80, so that's 80 divided by 2 which is 40, plus 20 more, so 60.
* The third friend says 25% more than 80.  25% of 80 is 80 times 0.25 which is 20. So the third friend says 80 plus 20, which is 100.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by 3 because there are three friends: 240 divided by 3 is 80.


80 

"
"Okay, so John has 10 dogs and each one takes half an hour to walk and stuff.  That means he spends 5 hours a day walking all the dogs (0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours).

If he does that every day, he spends 35 hours a week on the dogs (5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours).

"
"Let's see... Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  We know she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

Hmm, if we think of it like this: if she had the same number of gold and silver coins, she'd have 110 / 2 = 55 of each.

Since she has 30 more gold coins, she must have 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.


Answer: 85 

"
"Okay, so Raymond has 40 jewels.  Aaron has 5 more than half of that, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 less than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23
"
"Okay, so Mike scored 4 points in the first part of the game.  Then he got even better and scored 25% more in the second part. That means he scored 1 more point (4 x 0.25 = 1). So in the second part, he scored 5 points (4 + 1 = 5).

To find the total, we add up the points from both parts: 4 + 5 = 9 points.


9 

"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and that's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts for the whole month.

Since the yogurts come in packs of 4, he needs 60 / 4 = 15 packs.

Each pack costs $5.00, so 15 packs would cost 15 * $5.00 = $75.00.


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so John sold his Legos for $15 each and he had 13 of them. That means he made 13 times 15, which is $195.  He spent $20 on each video game and got 8 of them, so that's 20 times 8, or $160. He had $5 left over, so before buying the games he had $160 + $5 = $165.

That means he sold enough Legos to make $165, so he sold $165 divided by $15 per Lego, which is 11 Legos.

If he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Legos left.


2 

"
"Okay, so John runs 60 miles a week, and he runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.  The other two days he runs half as long, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

That means he runs 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours on the shorter days.

So in total, he runs 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

10 

"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs.  That means she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

She walks four times slower than she runs, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She runs for one-third of the time, which is 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours. That means she runs 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

She walks for two-thirds of the time, which is 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.  That means she walks 1.5 * 4 = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 + 6 = 18 miles.


18
"
"Okay, so Suzy's phone is 1 year old. Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, so it's 1 times 2 which is 2 years old. Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 2 times 4 which equals 8 years old.

"
"Okay, so Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally. But with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, which is 400 times 3, or 1200 feet! The dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, so she can stand 1200 minus 1000 feet away, which is 200 feet.


200 

"
"Grandma baked a lot of pie!  She had 5 pies and each one had 8 slices, so that's 5 times 8, which is 40 slices in total. If there were 14 slices left, then the guests ate 40 minus 14, which is 26 slices.


26 

"
"Okay, so you can eat 200 more calories today.  The chips have 250 calories per serving, and there are 5 servings in the bag. That means each serving is 300 grams divided by 5 servings, which is 60 grams per serving.

You can only eat 200 calories worth of chips, so that's 200 divided by 250 calories per serving, which is 0.8 servings.

So, you can eat 0.8 servings times 60 grams per serving, which equals 48 grams of chips.


48 

"
"Okay, so Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles because he can make 10 candles from each pound.  That means his supplies will cost him $20.00.  If he sells all 20 candles for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00.  So, his profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes a lot of blog posts!

* On Tuesday, she wrote 2 more articles than Monday, which is 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
* On Wednesday, she wrote double the amount from Tuesday, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 articles.
* In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.
* Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 x 4 = 104 hours writing.


104 

"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 sticky notes. Then she used 220 at work.  That's 80 + 220 = 300 sticky notes.

She had 23 left over, so she must have bought 300 - 23 = 277 sticky notes.


277 

"
"Okay, so John bought 5 blue ties because he spent $200 and each one costs $40.  Since he buys twice as many red ties, he got 10 red ties. Red ties are 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $60 each. That means the red ties cost him 10 * $60 = $600.  

In total, he spent $200 + $600 = $800 on ties.


$800 

"
"Okay, so Tracy had a wire that was 4 feet long.  That's the same as 48 inches because there are 12 inches in every foot. She cut the wire into pieces that were 6 inches long. To find out how many pieces she got, we just need to divide the total length by the length of each piece: 48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors and 8 apartments on each floor, so that's 15 times 8 which equals 120 apartments in total.  If three-quarters of them are full, then 120 divided by 4 is 30, and 3 times 30 is 90 apartments are full. That means 120 minus 90 equals 30 apartments are empty.


30 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd has a lot of chickens!  

He gets 252 eggs every day, and that's 252 times 7 for a whole week, which is 1764 eggs.

Now, there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so he has 1764 divided by 12, which is 147 dozen eggs.

He sells each dozen for $2, so he makes 147 times 2, which is $294 every week.


294 

"
"Okay, so Tom sails for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  

Then he has to sail back 30 miles, but this time he's going slower, only 6 miles per hour.  

To find out how long that takes, we do 30 miles divided by 6 miles per hour, which equals 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them. That's 30 times 0.25, which is 7.5 pounds.  

That means he still needs to take out 15 minus 7.5, or 7.5 more pounds. His toys weigh half a pound each, so he needs to take out 7.5 divided by 0.5, which is 15 toys.


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. He also fixed 4 car tires, which is 4 * $40 = $160.  So on Thursday, he made $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. That's 12 * $40 = $480.

To see how much more he made on the better day, we do $520 - $480 = $40.


Answer: 40 

"
"Okay, so Patchy had three times the number of kittens as the 7 they brought home, so that's 7 times 3 which is 21 kittens.  Then Trixie had 12 kittens.  So all together the cats had 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.  

Then you add the 7 they brought home, so that's 33 + 7 = 40 kittens!


40 

"
"Jean has 28 lollipops left after eating some. Since she puts 2 lollipops in each bag, she can make 14 bags. 


14 

"
"Okay, so Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, which is a total of $14 each time he goes to the movies.  If he has $42, he can go 3 times because 3 x $14 = $42.


3 

"
"Okay, so the truck can hold a total of 5000 pounds, but the truck and driver already weigh 3755 pounds. That means there's only 1245 pounds left for the boxes.  Each box weighs 15 pounds, so we gotta see how many times 15 goes into 1245.  

Doing the math, 1245 divided by 15 is 83. 


83 

"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries cost $40.00.  Then they added 25% for a delivery fee, which is like a quarter of the price.  So that's $40.00 x 0.25 = $10.00.

Then they added $3.00 for delivery, so now it's $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.

Finally, he tipped $4.00, so the total is $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.


$57.00
"
"Okay, so there are 6 groups of raspberries with 20 in each group. That's 6 times 20, which is 120 raspberries. Then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out on the bush.  So, 120 plus 67 is 187 raspberries in total.


187 

"
"Okay, so there are 25 oranges in total.  One is bad, 5 are unripe (20% of 25), and 2 are sour.  That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.

If 8 are bad, then 25 - 8 = 17 oranges are good.


17 

"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff for the brooch and then another $800 to have someone make it. That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she had to pay 10% for insurance.  10% of $1300 is $130 (because 10% is like dividing by 10, so $1300 / 10 = $130).

So in total, she spent $1300 + $130 = $1430.


$1430
"
"Okay, so Marcy gets $50,000 a year after working for 40 years. But she gets extra money after 20 years.  She works for 30 years, so she gets the extra money for 10 years.

The extra money is 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500 each year.

So, her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.


$52,500 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month for her streaming. That's $140 x 6 = $840 for the first six months.

Then her price goes down by 10%, so she saves $140 x 0.10 = $14 each month.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months.

So for the last six months, she pays $126 x 6 = $756.

To find the total, we add up both halves: $840 + $756 = $1596


1596
"
"Okay, so Sophia drove 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas. That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG).  Her gas tank holds 12 gallons, so she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).


300 

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for 1 hour (that's half the time of TV).  He does that every day for 3 days a week. So that's 3 hours a day times 3 days, which is 9 hours a week.

Then, over 4 weeks, it's 9 hours a week times 4 weeks, which equals 36 hours.


36 

"
"Okay, so each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 players.

Then they have 2 coaches, one for each team, so that's 10 + 2 = 12 people per school.

Since there are 4 schools, we do 12 * 4 = 48 people in total.

"Okay, so there were 175 diamonds.  There were 35 less rubies than diamonds, so there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. There were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so there were 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total, we add them all up: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems.


595 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. That means there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys.  

That's a lot of kids!  

So there are 120 + 60 = 180 students total.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, then there are 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.


36 

"
"Okay, so Bailey got $5 every week for 8 weeks, which is $5 x 8 = $40.  If she has $100 now, she must have started with $100 - $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Judy teaches a lot of dance classes! Let's see... she teaches 5 classes each day from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 times 5 which is 25 classes. Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday.  So in total, she teaches 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Each class has 15 students, so that's 33 times 15 which is 495 students in total.

If each student pays $15, then she makes 495 times 15 which is $7425.00 in a week.

$7425.00 

"
"Okay, so the first recipe has 20 steps. The second one has twice that, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 steps.  To make both dishes, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 steps.


60 

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and he sold 43 of them. That's 43 times 3, which is $129.  He also sold cheesecake for $4 a slice and sold 23 slices. So that's 23 times 4, which equals $92.  To find out how much he made in total, we add the brownie money and the cheesecake money: $129 + $92 = $221.


221 

"
"Okay, so Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, so that's 5 times 150, which is $750.  

But there's also interest! It's 2% of each phone, so that's $3 extra for each one. Since she bought 5, the total interest is $3 times 5, which is $15.

So, all together, she has to pay $750 plus $15, which is $765.

She pays that over 3 months, so each month she pays $765 divided by 3, which is $255.


Answer: 255 

"
"Okay, so Artie sells marigolds for $3 a pot now, petunias for $2 a pot, and begonias for $2 a pot.

* He sells 12 marigolds, so that's 12 x $3 = $36
* He sells 9 petunias, so that's 9 x $2 = $18
* He sells 17 begonias, so that's 17 x $2 = $34

If you add all that up, he makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88


88
"
"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet.  The level below that is double that, so it's 32 square feet. The next level down is double 32, which is 64 square feet. And the bottom level is double 64, making it 128 square feet.

To find the average, you add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Then you divide the total by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.


60 

"
"Okay, so the puppy eats 1 cup of food a day for the first 180 days, that's 180 cups of food. Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is like 185 more days. So that's 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

In total, that's 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups for the whole year.

Each bag has 110 cups, so she'll need 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of food.

"
"Okay, so Sarah does a lot of laundry, 400 pounds! Raymond does half of that, so he does 200 pounds. David does way less, only a fourth of what Sarah does, so he does 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 100 more pounds of laundry than David.


100 

"
"Okay, so Vincent wants to get the best deal on flowers.  

If he buys the packs of 3, it'll cost him $2.50 times 6 packs, which is $15.00.

But if he buys the packs of 2, it'll only cost him $1.00 times 9 packs, which is $9.00.

That means he saves $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by buying the smaller packs.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so the groomer costs $100, but John gets 30% off because he's a new customer.  To find out how much the discount is, you do 100 times 0.30, which is $30. Then you take $30 off the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

$70 

"
"Okay, so they started with 24 liters.  Each girl got 1/6 of that, which is 4 liters (24 / 6 = 4).  Since there are two girls, they took 8 liters total (4 x 2 = 8).

That leaves 16 liters (24 - 8 = 16). Then the boy took 6 liters, so there's 10 liters left (16 - 6 = 10).


10 

"
"Okay, so Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he gets a bunch more: 21 from the store and 23 for his birthday.  That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers!

He gives 9 to his sister, so he has 54 - 9 = 45 left.

Then he uses 28 for a card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.


17 

"
"Okay, so Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds.  That means Alex weighs (4 * 125) - 2 pounds.  

So, Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Okay, so Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each one has 25 roses. That's 3 times 25, which is 75 roses in total.  

Each rose has 8 thorns, so we need to multiply the number of roses by 8: 75 times 8 equals 600 thorns.


600 

"
"Okay, so they played 22 games total.  They won more games than they lost, and they won 8 more games than they lost.  

To figure out how many they won, we can think of it like this:

* If they lost 7 games, they won 15 games (because 7 + 8 = 15).

Let's check if that adds up to 22 games: 7 + 15 = 22.  Yep!


**Answer:** 15 

"
"Okay, so Gene goes on 4 vacations every year, and he's been doing that since he was 23.  He's 34 now, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of vacations.

If he gets 4 shirts per year, he has 11 years * 4 shirts/year = 44 shirts to make quilt blocks.


44 

"
"Okay, so the alarm rang 4 times the first time. Then it rang 3 times longer the second time, so that's 4 times * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it rang half as long as the second time, which is 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total, we add up all the times it rang: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.


22 

"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise every year because she's been working there for a while.  

* First year, she gets an extra 10% of $600, which is $60. So now she makes $660.
* The next year, she gets 10% of $660, which is $66. Now she makes $726.
* One more year, she gets 10% of $726, which is $72.60. That means she makes $798.60.


Answer: 798.60 

"
"Let's see... Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, so if we think of Harald's sales as 1 part, Marilyn's sales are 10 parts. That makes a total of 11 parts.

If they sold 88,000 copies in total, and that's 11 parts, then one part is 88,000 divided by 11.  

88,000 / 11 = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.


8,000 

"
"Okay, so Christina invited 16 friends, but some might not come. She needs 0.75 gift bags for each person who actually shows up.  That means she needs enough for 16 x (3/4) = 12 people.

She needs 12 x 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

If each bag costs $2, she'll spend 9 x $2 = $18.


$18 

"
"Okay, so each grown-up dino eats 10 pounds of potato salad.  There are 20 grown-ups, so that's 20 x 10 = 200 pounds.

Little dinos eat half as much, so they eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. With 5 little dinos, that's 5 x 5 = 25 pounds.

To feed everyone, Ted needs 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad.


225 

"
"Okay, so Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the pets Marcia has, so Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.  

To find the total, we add up all the pets: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.


28 

"
"Okay, so Corey is 1 year older than James, who is 10. That means Corey is 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so she's 9.  Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4.


4 

"
"Okay, so Lee is super fast! He runs the 400 hurdles in 38 seconds, which is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. That means Gerald used to take 40 seconds.

But Gerald got serious about his diet and got 10% faster.  10% of 40 seconds is 4 seconds (I did 40 times 0.10).

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds minus 4 seconds, which is 36 seconds!


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs, and for every dog there are 2 cats, so that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 + 180 = 348 pets.


348 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 kids in total, and 2 out of every 5 are boys. That means there are 80 boys (200 / 5 * 2 = 80).

That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

Two-thirds of the girls are in Girl Scouts, so that's 80 girls (120 / 3 * 2 = 80).

So, 40 girls aren't in Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"
"James slept for 2/3 of the time Harry did, so he slept for (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours.  Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

"
"Okay, so Freda's sauce is half the size of the tomatoes she starts with.  She made 32 ounces of sauce, so she must have started with 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Each can has 16 ounces, so she used 64 ounces / 16 ounces/can = 4 cans of tomatoes.

If each can has 3 tomatoes, she used 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.


12 

"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars at first, and 5 took a different way out. That leaves 25 cars. Then 20 cars went through in the last part of the jam. So, 25 minus 20 is 5 cars that must have gone through in the first part.


5 

"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, that's 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she gets 18 more, so she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants. But she gives one plant from each ledge away, so that's 40 plants she gives away.  That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants.


58 

"
"Okay, so Jerome's first friend rang the doorbell 20 times. His second friend rang it 5 more times than that, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times, so the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

To find the total, we add up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo has to read a bunch of pages from different books. Let's see...

He needs to read 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages total.

He already read 15 pages, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

He has 4 more days to read, so he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.


6 

"
"Okay, so John drinks water with every meal, that's like 4 glasses a day on weekdays.  And he does that for 5 days, so that's 20 glasses. On the weekend he skips the water at dinner, so he only drinks 3 glasses a day times 2 days, which is 6 glasses.  

So in total, he drinks 20 + 6 = 26 glasses of water.

26 

"
"Okay, so the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide, so that's 42 divided by 3, which is 14 sections of 3 miles each.

If each section takes 10 minutes, then 14 sections would take 14 times 10 minutes, which is 140 minutes.


140 

"
"Okay, so Poppy puts down 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces.  That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces. Then her mom puts down 750 / 3 = 250 more.  So they put down a total of 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left.

"Cody eats 3 times more than Amir, who eats 5 cookies. So Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.

"
"Okay, so each box is 5 by 6 by 4 on the outside, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means we gotta take away 2 inches from each side to find the space inside.

So, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.

To find the space inside one box, we multiply: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since he has 3 boxes, we multiply that by 3: 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"
"Okay, so Frankie watched 7 hours of TV total. Let's see...

* Monday and Tuesday he watched 1 hour each day, so that's 2 hours.
* Thursday he watched 1 hour plus a 30-minute show, which is another half hour, for a total of 1 and a half hours.
* Friday he watched two 1-hour shows, so that's 2 more hours.

That's 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

So, he watched 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.

Since each of those 30-minute shows is half an hour, he watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours/show = 3 shows on Wednesday. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Henry has 110 cookies now, but he dropped 5, so that means he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies before that.

He also made 15 extra cookies, so before those he had 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Since he made twice as many this year, he made 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50
"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.  If they buy 10 gallons, that's 10 times $3.00, which is $30.00. Then they get 10 times $0.20 back, which is $2.00. So, $30.00 minus $2.00 is $28.00.


$28.00 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice ate 2 times 24 roll-ups, which is 48. Marcell ate 3 times 14 roll-ups, which is 42.  That means they ate a total of 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups.

Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking, that's not good!  

Let's see... it takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet.  She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows 1.25 feet every second.

If it takes her 64 seconds to get to shore, she rows 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

That means the boat took on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.


16 

"
"Okay, so each teacher uses the whiteboard 2 times a day, and they clean it 3 times each time they use it.  So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 times per teacher.  Since there are 4 teachers, we do 6 times 4, which equals 24.

"Okay, so Jamal's phone holds way more pictures than Brittany's. It's like, 6 times more!  Brittany's phone can only hold 300 pictures, and Jamal's holds 1800.

If Brittany's phone could hold 300 pictures, and that's 50 times more than the ducks in Jamal's picture, then there must be 300 divided by 50 ducks in the picture.

That means there are 6 ducks in Jamal's picture. 


6
"
"Okay, so Sasha bought some wood a while back, and now it's worth more!  

She has ten of those long, skinny boards, the 2x4s. She paid $10 for each one, so that's 10 times $10, which is $100. Now they're worth $15 each, so she can sell them for 10 times $15, which is $150.

She also has five of the thicker boards, the 4x4s. Those were $16 each, so she spent 5 times $16, which is $80. Now they're worth $24 each, so she can sell them for 5 times $24, which is $120.

If she sells all the wood, she'll make $150 + $120, which is $270.  But she spent $100 + $80, which is $180 to buy it all.

So, her profit is $270 - $180, which is $90!


$90
"
"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water in a 7 to 13 ratio. That means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is just sugar.

First, add the numbers in the ratio: 7 + 13 = 20.

Then, divide the total amount (120) by the total ratio parts (20): 120 / 20 = 6.

That means each ""part"" of the ratio is worth 6.

Finally, multiply the sugar part of the ratio (7) by the value of each part (6): 7 * 6 = 42.


So Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar. 

42
"
"Okay, so John has 3 kids and buys each of them 2 pairs of shoes. That's 3 times 2, which is 6 pairs of shoes in total.

Each pair costs $60, so 6 pairs would cost 6 times 60, which is $360.


$360 

"
"Okay, so they had 10 cars on the first day.  Then they had 30 cars total. That means they got 20 more cars (30 - 10 = 20).

Since each container has 5 cars, they must have brought in 4 more containers (20 / 5 = 4).


4 

"
"Okay, so Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, and that was 30% more than Lylah.  To find out Lylah's salary, we gotta figure out what number is 30% less than $40,000.

That means Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 four years ago.

Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so he made an extra $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000.

So four years later, Adrien makes $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%, which is $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69.

Four years later, Lylah makes $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.

Finally, to find their total salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92



$99,076.92
"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. That means he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets a month.


240 

"
"Okay, so Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.

Kael has 5 apples * 2 = 10 apples and 8 oranges / 2 = 4 oranges. That's 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits! 


27
"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night.  That's 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night. That's 7 hours a night for 4 nights, which is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

To find the total, we add up all the hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"
"Okay, so Rosie runs super fast at first! 10 miles every hour for 3 hours is a lot of ground covered. That's 30 miles already!

Then she slows down to 5 miles per hour.  She runs for another 4 hours at that speed. So that's 5 times 4, which is 20 more miles.

If you add those together, 30 + 20, she runs a total of 50 miles.

"
"Amy made a bunch of new friends! If Lily made 50 friends and Amy made 20 more than that, then Amy made 70 friends.  

To find out how many friends they have together, we just add the number of friends they each have: 70 + 50 = 120 friends.

"Okay, so Dillon needs to buy a bunch of stuff.  

* Watermelons cost $45 each because they're three times the price of a pepper, which is $15.
* Oranges are $40 each, which is $5 less than a watermelon.

Let's see how much everything costs:

* 4 watermelons cost 4 * $45 = $180
* 20 peppers cost 20 * $15 = $300
* 10 oranges cost 10 * $40 = $400

Adding it all up, Dillon spends $180 + $300 + $400 = $880 at the store.


$880
"
"Okay, so the hospital sees a lot of people every day!  

They see 500 people, and each person is there for 24 minutes. That's a lot of time!

If we add up all the time the doctors spend seeing patients, it's 12,000 minutes (500 patients times 24 minutes).

That's 200 hours (12,000 minutes divided by 60 minutes in an hour).

The doctors get paid $150 for each hour, so that's $30,000 they get paid (200 hours times $150).

But the hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they make $40,000 (200 hours times $200).

To find out how much profit they make, we subtract the doctor's pay from what they charge patients: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So the hospital makes a profit of $10,000.


$10,000

"Okay, so first, a third of the elves quit because of the vomit. That's 60 elves divided by 3, which is 20 elves.

Then, 40 elves are left. But then 10 more quit because of the shin-kicking. So, 40 elves minus 10 elves is 30 elves.


30

"Okay, so Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times. That's 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides.

Then they each rode the luge twice, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

In total, they went on 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.

"
"Okay, so Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. Then on Tuesday, he walked 6 times that amount, which is 4 times 6 = 24 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.

Since he walked 41 miles total, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.

"
"Okay, so Tom gets 4 car washes every month, and each one costs $15.  To find out how much he spends in a year, we gotta do some multiplying!

First, we figure out how much he spends each month: 4 car washes * $15/car wash = $60.

Then, we multiply that by the number of months in a year: $60/month * 12 months = $720.


720

"Okay, so there are 27 unicorns in total, and one-third of them are in Scotland. That's 27 divided by 3, which is 9 unicorns.  Then, two-thirds of those Scottish unicorns are girls. So, that's 9 times (2/3), which equals 6.

"
"Okay, so Rory's subs cost $15.00, the chips are $3.00, and the cookies are $2.00.  That's $20.00 in total for the food.

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.

So now it's $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

She also wants to tip $5.00, so the final cost is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00


$29.00 

"
"Okay, so Mark took two tests. The first one had 75 questions, and he could do 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours for that test, so he finished 5 * 8 = 40 questions. That means he didn't finish 75 - 40 = 35 questions on the first test.

The second test had 100 questions, and he again did 5 questions each hour. This time he had 6 hours, so he finished 5 * 6 = 30 questions.  He left 100 - 30 = 70 questions unfinished on the second test.

In total, he didn't finish 35 + 70 = 105 questions.


105 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 blue gumballs.  Four times that amount is 12 x 4 = 48.  Then we add 22 more, so there are 48 + 22 = 70 pink gumballs.


70 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 cars in total.  12 are automatic and 4 are manual. That means 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

To find the percentage, we do (4 semi-automatic cars / 20 total cars) * 100% = 20%

"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's think about it like this: if there's one queen bee, there are two baby bees, and then four worker bees (because there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

That's one queen + two babies + four workers = seven bees.

Since we have 700 bees, we need to figure out how many groups of seven bees fit into 700.

700 divided by 7 is 100.

So there must be 100 groups of seven bees. That means there are 100 queen bees.

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, there are 100 * 2 = 200 baby bees.

And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are 200 * 2 = 400 worker bees.



**Answer:** 400 

"
"If Jordan worked instead of playing video games, he'd make $10 an hour for 2 hours a day. That's $10 x 2 = $20 a day.  

In a week, he'd make $20 a day x 7 days = $140.

"
"Okay, so John buys some stuff, right?  

The milk and eggs are food, so they don't have extra tax. That's $2 + $3 = $5.

The other stuff is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.  But there's a 10% tax on that, so that's $10 x 0.10 = $1 extra.

So the non-food stuff costs $10 + $1 = $11.

All together, everything costs $5 + $11 = $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Kim has 8 clients in total.  He needs 2 bottles of bleach for each client, and each bottle costs $2, so that's 8 * 2 * $2 = $32 for bleach.

He also needs cloths, and those are $5 each, so that's 8 * $5 = $40 for cloths.

His total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72.

He makes $92 each week, and his expenses are $72, so his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.


$20 

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of pineapples!  

He has 10 hectares, and each one has 100 pineapples. That means he has 10 * 100 = 1000 pineapples each time he harvests.

He harvests every 3 months, and there are 12 months in a year, so he harvests 12 / 3 = 4 times a year.

So, in a year, he gets 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples!


4000 

"
"Okay, so Johnny has three boxes of Legos. One has 500 pieces. Another one is three times bigger, so that's 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces. The last box is a quarter of the size of the first one, so that's 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total, we add them all up: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.


2125 

"
"Okay, so Debra saw 30 bees leave at first. Then 30 / 2 = 15 bees came back.  

Then she saw twice as many bees leave, so that's 30 * 2 = 60 bees.

That means a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees flew out of the hive.

Since all the bees came back eventually, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Okay, so Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy.  So Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends.

James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"
"Okay, so Steve bikes 3 miles and Tim skateboards 2 miles.  We need to figure out how much longer Tim takes to get home.

First, we gotta change the miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve goes 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim goes 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, so it takes him 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim skateboards at 264 feet per minute, so it takes him 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

That means Tim takes 40 - 36 = 4 minutes longer than Steve.


**Answer:** 4 

"
"Okay, so Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire.  

Let's see... 5 bikes times 2 tires each is 10 tires. Then 3 tricycles times 3 tires each is 9 tires. And the unicycle has 1 tire.

So that's 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires total.

20 tires times 25 cents each is 5 dollars! 


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so Carl buys 10 packs of cookies and each pack has 6 cookies, so that's 10 times 6 which is 60 cookies.  Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies times 10 cents is $6.00. If he pays with a $10 bill, his change is $10.00 minus $6.00, which is $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Dave ate 14 fries. The seagull ate half of that, which is 7 fries.  So there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left. Then the pigeons ate 9 fries (3 pigeons times 3 fries each). That leaves 21 - 9 = 12 fries. The raccoon ate two-thirds of those, which is 8 fries. That means there were 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.  Since there was 1 fry left after the ants, there must have been 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants got to them.

"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three times a day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and each class is an hour long. That's 3 times 1, which is 3 hours each of those days.  

Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes that are each 2 hours long. So that's 2 times 2, which is 4 hours each of those days.

That means he has 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

And he has 4 + 4 = 8 hours of class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

So in total, he has 9 + 8 = 17 hours of class each week.

There are 16 weeks in a semester, so he has 17 times 16 = 272 hours of class in a semester.

"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of yummy stuff! Let's see...

* He makes 300 rolls, and each is 4 inches long, so that's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches of rolls.
* He makes 120 croissants, and they're 6 inches each, so that's 120 * 6 = 720 inches of croissants.
* The baguettes are trickier. He makes 60, and each is 2 feet long.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 * 12 = 24 inches long. That means all the baguettes are 60 * 24 = 1440 inches long.

Now, let's add it all up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

But the question wants the answer in feet, so we gotta divide by 12: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.

"
"Okay, so the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas every month.

Since he needs enough for two months, he needs to order 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's like running 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back), so she runs 34 * 80 = 2720 yards doing that.

In total, Kelly runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.


**Answer:** 1320 

"
"Okay, so Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 times 1.50 which is $6.  He got 2 notebooks at $4 each, so that's 2 times 4 which is $8.  Then he got the bond paper for $20.  To find the total, we add it all up: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

"
"Okay, so Finn starts with 11 tadpoles. Then he sees 6 more, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 hide, so there are 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles left.

"Okay, so on Tuesday the tank had 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water.

Then on Wednesday it had 24 / 3 * 2 = 16 feet of water.

"
"Okay, so Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. That's 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 5 less starfish than Anakin, so he got 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 less seahorses, so he got 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses. And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he got 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish!


32 

"
"Okay, so the price goes up by 20% every two months. That means every two months it gets $4 more expensive ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

So, in 36 months, the price will go up 18 times (36 / 2 = 18).

That's a total increase of $72 ($4 x 18 = $72).

So, the bag of marbles will cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92).


$92 

"
"Okay, so the doll costs the same as three action figures, and each action figure is $5. That means the doll costs $15.  There are five red cars, and each one is $4, so all the cars together cost $20.  

Let's add up the cost of everything: $15 (doll) + $20 (cars) + $15 (action figures) = $50

"If Jackie does her own taxes, she loses $35 for every hour she can't work on her freelance job.  She'd lose 3 hours, so that's 3 times $35, which is $105.

"
"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 10, Seth is 20.  

In two years, Brooke will be 12 and Seth will be 22.  

If we add those together, 12 + 22 = 34.  

That's not 28, so Brooke must be younger. Let's try if Brooke is 8.  Then Seth is 16.

In two years, Brooke will be 10 and Seth will be 18.

10 + 18 = 28!  That's right!

So Seth is 16 years old.

"Okay, so Ethel has $8.  Jimmy has twice that amount plus $2 more.  

Twice Ethel's money is 2 * $8 = $16.

Then add the extra $2: $16 + $2 = $18

Jimmy has $18.

"
"Okay, so Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. So that's 20 times 5 which is 100 miles.

Then on the weekend he walks 10 miles each day, so that's 10 times 2 which is 20 miles.

To find the total, we add the weekday miles and the weekend miles: 100 plus 20 is 120 miles.

"
"Okay, so the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times that, so it's $25 x 3 = $75.  The pants cost the same as the average of the hat and jacket.  So, that's ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

To find the total cost, we add up the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.


$150 

"
"Okay, so Jake sees a bunch of creepy crawlies! Let's see... 80 spiders with 8 legs each is 80 times 8, which is 640 legs. Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs, so that's 90 times 6, which equals 540 legs. And those weird mutant bugs have 10 legs each, so 3 times 10 is 30 legs.  

If we add all those up: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs!

1210 

"
"Okay, so Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so she's also 8. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 8 x 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19.  

To find the total age, we add up all their ages: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51

"
"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for school, $200 for her card, and $500 for her house, right? That's $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 every month.

She wants to pay extra, like half again as much, so that's $1000 times 0.50 which is $500 more.

So now she pays $1000 + $500 = $1500 every month.

In a year, that's $1500 times 12 months, which is $18000.


$18000 

"
"Okay, so Billy has a lot of potatoes to peel! 

It takes him a minute and a half for each potato, and that's 90 minutes just for peeling all 60 of them (60 x 1.5 = 90).

Cutting is way faster, only 5 seconds each.  That's 300 seconds total (60 x 5 = 300).  

Let's see, 300 seconds is 5 minutes (300 / 60 = 5).

So, peeling takes 90 minutes and cutting takes 5, for a total of 95 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Zaid makes $6000 a month. He spends $1500 on rent because that's a quarter of his money. Then he spends $2000 on gas, which is a third of his money.  

That's $1500 + $2000 = $3500 spent already.

He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

He gives half of that, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250 to charity.

Now he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so that's $200 + $700 = $900.

He has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

"
"Okay, so Jan is 30 now, which means two years ago she was 28.  Half of 28 is 14.  Mark was 5 years older than that, so he was 19 two years ago.  That means Mark is 21 now. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 23.

"
"Okay, so Team 1 is super fast, all running the same time. That's 55 seconds each, so they finish in 55 times 4, which is 220 seconds.

Team 2 is slower at first, but gets faster each time.  Let's see... 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 equals 222 seconds.

Team 1 is faster by 222 minus 220, which is 2 seconds!


2 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has a 50/50 chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 because there are three numbers bigger than 3 and six sides total.

To get two even numbers in a row, he has to get an even number on the first roll, which is half the time. Then he has to get another even number, which is also half the time. So that's half times half, which is a quarter chance, or 25%.

That means it's 50% - 25% = 25% more likely he'll roll a number bigger than 3.

"Okay, so there are 160 pieces of straw in total. The hamsters used 50 pieces (10 hamsters times 5 pieces each) and the rabbits used 20 pieces. That means the rats used 90 pieces (160 - 50 - 20 = 90).

If each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there must be 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).

Since the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats in each cage (15 / 3 = 5).

"
"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, right? And every month, she has to pay an extra 2% because of the interest.

So after one month, she owes $100 plus 2% of $100, which is $2. That means she owes $102.

The next month, she owes 2% of $102, which is $2.04. So now she owes $104.04.

And for the last month, she owes 2% of $104.04, which is $2.08.  That brings the total to $106.12.


$106.12 

"
"Okay, so the trader buys each bag for $20 and it costs $2 to move it, so that's $22 spent on each bag. He sells them for $30 each, so he makes $8 profit on each one.  If he made $400 profit total, he must have sold 50 bags. 


50
"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so food cost $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

The rides cost $33 each and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Finally, they split the cost evenly between 3 friends, so each person pays $102 / 3 = $34. 


$34
"
"Okay, so John collects peaches for 3 hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 3 times 60, which is 180 minutes. He picks 2 peaches every minute, so he gets 180 times 2 peaches, which is 360 peaches.


360 

"
"Okay, so the ducks need 3.5 pounds of bugs each week.  And there are 10 ducks, so that's 3.5 times 10 which is 35 pounds of bugs for all of them in a week.

To find out how much they need each day, we divide the total bugs by 7 days in a week. So 35 pounds divided by 7 days is 5 pounds per day.

"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees.  Each year he plants 10 more, but cuts down 2. So that's like adding 8 trees every year (10 - 2 = 8).

After 10 years, he's added 80 trees (8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees).  That means he has 130 trees total (50 + 80 = 130).

But wait, 30% of them die!  That's 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).

So, in the end, he has 91 trees left (130 - 39 = 91).


91 

"
"Okay, so they started with 18 pink flamingos. Then they took away 1/3 of them, which is 6.  That leaves 12 pink ones. They painted those 6 white and put them back. Then they added 18 MORE pink ones, so there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink ones.  

There are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white ones.

"
"Okay, so Violetta wants 5 crayons and each one costs $2.  That means she'll spend 5 x $2 = $10.

If she has $20, she'll get $20 - $10 = $10 in change.

"
"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil and an eraser together. The pencil is $1.20 and the eraser is $0.30, so the pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

If one pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens would cost $1.50 x 8 = $12.00


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and need to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants.  That means they need 2 * 40 = 80 pounds of carrots.

If they have 200 pounds and only need 80, then they have 200 - 80 = 120 pounds left over.

"
"Okay, so there are 23,786 people in Soda.  If 8417 are men and 9092 are women, let's add those together: 8417 + 9092 = 17509 adults.

"
"Okay, so Elaine started with 20 cards. Then she got three times that amount, which is 20 x 3 = 60 cards.  

The next month she got 20 less than that, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In total for the first two months, she got 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

The third month she doubled that amount, so she got 100 x 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, to find out how many she has now, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences a week.  He does half for each publisher, so that's 500 sentences for each one.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them.

Publisher B pays him twice as much, so he makes 500 * ($0.05 * 2) = $50 from them.

In total, he makes $25 + $50 = $75.  

That's 7500 cents!

"
"Okay, so John gets a $5000 bonus, that's awesome!  

He also gets a raise, which is 5% of his old salary.  That means his raise is $2000 times 0.05, which is $100 extra each week.

Now he makes $2100 a week.  In a year, there are 52 weeks, so he makes $2100 times 52, which is $109,200.

Don't forget the bonus!  So in total, he made $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200 that year.

"
"Okay, so Josie has 10 acres of grapes, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. That's 10 times 5, which is 50 tons of grapes!

Then, she can make 2 barrels of wine from each ton of grapes. So, she gets 50 times 2 barrels, which is 100 barrels of wine.

"
"Okay, so Carl eats 2 slices of cheese on his sandwich every day, and he eats a sandwich every day for a whole week. That's 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

He also eats omelets with cheese 3 days a week. Each omelet has one more slice than his sandwich, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.  So for the omelets, he uses 3 days * 3 slices/omelet = 9 slices.

Finally, he uses 8 slices for his macaroni and cheese.

To find the total, we add up all the slices: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.


31 

"
"Okay, so Janet starts with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, that's 32 pens. Then she gets 6 bags of blue pens and each bag has 9 pens, so that's 6 times 9 which is 54 blue pens. She also gets 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, so that's 2 times 6 which is 12 red pens.  

So, she has 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 66 new pens.

In total, she has 32 pens + 66 pens = 98 pens.

"
"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average, and she's already taken five tests.  To get a 93 average on six tests, she needs a total of 93 times 6, which is 558 points.

She already has 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To get to 558, she needs 558 - 438 = 120 points on her last test.


**Answer:** 120 

"
"Okay, so Micheal rode his bike a lot! 

First, he rode 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time. That's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers every week. He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he changed his routine and rode only twice a week, but for longer distances, 60 kilometers each time. So that's 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers every week. He did that for three weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

To find the total, we add the distances from both parts: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.


860 

"
"Okay, so Joe has a lot of candy!  

Each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and there are 25 of them, so that's 40 * 25 = 1000 grams.

The candied apples are half the weight of the chocolate bars, so they each weigh 40 / 2 = 20 grams.

There are 80 candied apples, so they weigh 20 * 80 = 1600 grams.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of the chocolate and the apples: 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.


2600
"
"Okay, so Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday. Then on Tuesday, she bought three times that amount, which is 4 times 3, or 12 cakes.  On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the amount she got on Tuesday, so that's 12 times 5, which equals 60 cakes.  To find the total, we add up all the cakes: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.


76 

"
"Okay, so they sold half a dozen plates for $6000 each, which is $6000 / 2 = $3000.

Then they sold twenty dozen cups for $3000 - $1200 = $1800.

That means each cup cost $1800 / (20 * 12) = $7.50.


$7.50 

"
"Okay, so Sara needs $30 for the jacket and $40 for the shoes, which is $70 in total. She already has $30, so she needs $40 more.

If she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow 10 times to get $40.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has some chickens that lay different amounts of eggs. The red ones lay 3 eggs a day, and the white ones lay 5.  He gets 42 eggs every day.  

We also know he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.  

To figure out how many red chickens he has, we can think of it like this:

Let's say he has 'r' red chickens. That means he has 'r + 2' white chickens.

Now, the red chickens lay 3 eggs each, so they lay 3r eggs in total. The white chickens lay 5 eggs each, so they lay 5(r + 2) eggs.

All together, that's 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 eggs.

Let's solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"
"Okay, so the park is a rectangle, right?  That means to walk around it, you gotta go all the way around the outside.  

To find that out, we add up all the sides.  It's 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide, so that's 1.5 + 6 + 1.5 + 6 = 15 miles all the way around.

He walks 3 miles every hour, so it takes him 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

"
"Okay, so on the first day, Sloane saw 100 people. The next day she saw 50 more than that, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 people.  

That means in the first two days she saw 100 + 150 = 250 people.

If she saw 500 people total, then on the third day she saw 500 - 250 = 250 people.


250 

"
"Okay, so the big pool is losing water just as fast as the small pool, right?  They both lose 4 gallons every minute.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now it has four times as much. That means the big pool is losing water faster than the small pool, even though they leak at the same rate.

Hmm... let's see. If the big pool had twice as much water four minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means it lost less water than the small pool in those four minutes.

Since they both lose 4 gallons every minute, the small pool must have had more water to start with.

Thinking about it, if the small pool had 8 gallons four minutes ago, and lost 16 gallons (4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes), it would have 0 gallons now.  

That means the big pool must have had 16 gallons four minutes ago, and now has 0 gallons.

So the small pool has 8 gallons now.

"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra. That means she owes $2000 + (10/100)*$2000 = $2200 in total.

If she pays $165 each month for a whole year (12 months), she'll pay $165 * 12 = $1980.

To find out how much she still owes, we subtract what she paid from the total: $2200 - $1980 = $220.


Answer: 220 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias.  That means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  

To find the total, we add the roses and dahlias: 4 + 11 = 15 flowers.


15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now. Adrian is three times her age, so he's 21 x 3 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 21 x 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  

To find the average, we add their ages in three years: 24 + 66 + 45 = 135. Then we divide by 3: 135 / 3 = 45.


45 

"
"Okay, so Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri got 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so that's 68 divided by 2 which is 34, plus 10 more, so Yuri got 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she got 68 + 17 = 85 points.

To find out Jojo's score, we add up Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's scores: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197.  Then we subtract that from the total score: 251 - 197 = 54.

Jojo scored 54 points.

"
"Okay, so Carmen spent 30 minutes on crosswords because 3 puzzles times 10 minutes each is 30.  Then she spent 40 minutes on sudoku because 8 puzzles times 5 minutes each is 40.  If you add those together, she spent a total of 70 minutes playing games.


70 

"
"Okay, so Celine started with 120 liters and used 90 liters, which means she had 30 liters left. Then she collected double that amount of rainwater, so that's 30 times 2, which is 60 liters.  If she adds that to the 30 she already had, she has 90 liters in the tank now.


90 

"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 less petunias than that, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

To find the total, we add the geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent $15000 the first year. Then they spent a third of that the next year, which is $15000 divided by 3, that's $5000.  To find the total, we add the two years together: $15000 + $5000 = $20000


$20000 

"
"Okay, so Carlos pays $30 for each hour he has the canoe, and he has it for 3 hours. That means he pays 30 x 3 = $90.

Benji pays $18 each hour for the raft, and he uses it for 5 hours. So he pays 18 x 5 = $90 too.

To find out how much they pay together, we add their costs: $90 + $90 = $180.


180 

"
"Okay, so it takes 6 days to go to Rochester by bus.  If he drives back, it takes half the time, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 days.  

So the whole trip takes 6 + 3 = 9 days.

"
"Okay, so James starts with 40 water Pokemon. He loses 8, so now he has 32.  He also has 30 fire and 34 grass, for a total of 96 cards.

To find the chance of picking a water one, we do 32 (water cards) divided by 96 (total cards) and multiply by 100%. That's about 33%.


33 

"
"Okay, so Chad's burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds stuff, like extra meat for $2.00, cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each, so that's another $0.50.  

That brings his total to $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.50.

Oh, and he gets the meal upgrade for $3.00 more, so now it's $11.50 + $3.00 = $14.50.

But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!  So he only has to pay $14.50 - $5.00 = $9.50.



$9.50 

"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts in 4 pieces every minute, and her mom does half of that, which is 2 pieces a minute. Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces every minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

That's equal to 1 hour.

"
"Okay, so there were 120 watermelons at first. Ashlyn took 30% of them, which is like 30 out of every 100.  So she took 36 watermelons (30/100 * 120 = 36).

That left 84 watermelons (120 - 36 = 84). Then she came back and took 3/4 of those, which is like 63 watermelons (3/4 * 84 = 63).

That means there were 21 watermelons left over (84 - 63 = 21).


21 

"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars, and each one costs $20,000.  That's 12 times 20,000, which is $240,000.

Then he has to pay 10% tax.  That means 10% of $240,000, which is $24,000.

So now the cars cost $240,000 plus $24,000, which is $264,000.

But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 to register each car, and he has 12 cars. So that's 12 times $1000, which is $12,000.

Finally, we add that to the cost of the cars and tax: $264,000 plus $12,000 equals $276,000.


$276,000 

"
"Okay, so Kylie got 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, and he got 20. That means Kylie found 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

On Tuesday, she doubled that amount, so she got 25 x 2 = 50 shells.


50 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 ants, and Dax found half that many bugs.  That means there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.

To find the total number of insects, we add the ants and bugs: 50 + 25 = 75 insects.


75 

"
"Okay, so there are 36 penguins chilling in the snow.  One-third of them go for a swim, which is 36 divided by 3, so that's 12 penguins. Then another 12 penguins go eat, because that's also one-third.  So, 12 plus 12 is 24 penguins who aren't sunbathing anymore. That means 36 minus 24 equals 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.


12
"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3.  That means they eat a total of 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes every day.

In a week, that's 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine grows 3 tomatoes a week, so Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines. 


21 

"
"Okay, so John has 20 friends and they each want 4 slices. That's 20 times 4, which is 80 slices in total.  Each pizza has 8 slices, so he needs 80 divided by 8, which is 10 pizzas.


10 

"
"Okay, so Ram has 25 pens.  He can use 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen.  That means he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

So he'll have his original 25 pens plus the 5 new ones, for a total of 30 pens!

"
"Okay, so Jessa is 20. Joan is 5 years older than her, so Joan is 25. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 23.  If you add their ages together, 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.


68 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the students left through exit A, which is 300 students (because 30/100 times 1000 is 300).

That means 700 students were left. Then, 3/5 of those students left through exit B, which is 420 students (because 3/5 times 700 is 420).

So, 280 students must have left through exit C (because 700 - 420 = 280).


280 

"
"Okay, so John has 54 candies and that's twice the amount Robert has.  That means Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.


21 

"
"Okay, so Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1. If they both read each other's books too, that means Dolly reads 3 books total, and Pandora reads 3 books total.  So together they read 6 books!

"
"Okay, so Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of them sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, so that's 6 letters he gets and 6 letters he sends.

Each letter has 5 pages, so that's 6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages he writes and 30 pages he gets, for a total of 60 pages.

He writes one page every 6 minutes, so 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes of writing.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing each week. 


6
"
"Okay, so Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, and that's 15 times 30 days, which is 450 minutes.  He also used another 300 minutes.  That's a total of 750 minutes used.  He started with 1000 minutes, so he has 1000 minus 750 minutes left.

250 

"
"Okay, so Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5, and Billy took twice that, which is 10 fries.  That's 15 fries gone already, so Griffin had 24 - 15 = 9 fries left.

Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so he took 2 fries. That leaves Griffin with 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 27 - 7 = 20 fries.


**Answer:** 20 

"
"Okay, so there are way more snails in one tank than the other.  The problem says the difference in snails is the same as double the number of fish in each tank.  

If we take the difference in snails (32 - 4 = 28) and divide that by 2, we get 14.

So there must be 14 fish in each tank. 


14 

"
"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 every hour, and it takes 6 hours each day to do Jean's makeup. That means it costs $250 * 6 = $1500 every day.

She needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 a week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, so the total cost before the discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount, so that's $30000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

So, Jean pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000.


$27000
"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party.

Since she split the cost with her two parents, that means there are 3 people paying.  

So, each person pays $96 / 3 = $32.


$32 

"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag has 50 pounds of onions. That's a lot of onions!  

So, first, we need to find out how many pounds of onions he has in total: 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds.

Now, each pound costs $1.50. To find the total cost, we multiply the total weight by the price per pound: 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.00


$300.00 

"
"Okay, so Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, that's 5 + 13 = 18 cookies total.

Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

That means Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies total.

Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.


5600
"
"Okay, so there are 60 students in the whole school.  Half are boys and half are girls, so that's 30 boys and 30 girls.

The first two classes have 15 + 12 = 27 girls.  That means there are 3 girls in the third class.

Since each class has 20 kids, there must be 20 - 3 = 17 boys in the third class. 


17
"
"Okay, so Travis started with 61 apps. He got rid of 9, so that's 61 - 9 = 52 apps left. Then he added 18 more, so now he has 52 + 18 = 70 apps.

"
"Okay, so Rick killed a bunch of animals. Last night he got 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today he got three times as many wolves as cougars, and 3 less cougars than yesterday.  

Let's see... today he got 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

And three times that many wolves is 12 x 3 = 36 wolves.

So in total, he got 10 + 36 = 46 wolves.

And for cougars, it's 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

That means he killed a total of 46 + 27 = 73 animals. 


73
"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  Then he goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6 more.  

So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then you add 6, which makes 18.

18 

"
"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went 30% less than that, which is like 30 times 0.30, which is 9 less times. So Anne went down 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as many as Anne, so he went down 21 times 4, which is 84 times.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 10 times 20, which is 200 cows. Then Mr. Sylas gets 40 more cows. So now there are 200 plus 40, which is 240 cows.

He puts the new cows in all 20 stalls, so each stall gets 240 divided by 20, which is 12 cows.

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we do 8 times 12, which is 96.


96 

"
"Okay, so Brady has a bunch of coins and dollar bills. Let's see...

* He has 100 pennies, which is just a dollar.
* He has 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 40 times 5, which is 200 cents, or $2.00.
* He has 20 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 20 times 10, which is 200 cents, or $2.00.
* And he has 40 dollar bills, so that's $40.00.

If we add all that up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00


45.00 

"
"Okay, so the tree is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot part weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 parts to the tree (200 / 10 = 20).

So the whole tree weighed 8000 pounds at first (20 x 400 = 8000).

But the termites ate 30% of it, which is 2400 pounds (8000 x 0.30 = 2400).

That means the tree now weighs 5600 pounds (8000 - 2400 = 5600).


Answer: 5600 

"
"Okay, so Nancy has 8 books that are late, and each one costs 50 cents extra. That's 8 times 50 cents, which is $4.00.  Then she has to pay another $2.00 because some of the books were super late. So in total, she owes $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal.  That means Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total, we add up all the fruit: 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 fruits.


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs flour for 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, that's 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.  

A dozen cookies needs 2 cups of flour, and 66 cookies is 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozens.

So she needs 5.5 x 2 = 11 cups of flour.


11 

"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies, and we want to know how much two-thirds of them are worth.

First, we gotta figure out how many pennies are in two-thirds:

(2/3) * 9300 pennies = 6200 pennies

Now, we know there are 6200 pennies.  To get the dollar amount, we divide by 100 because there are 100 pennies in a dollar:

6200 pennies / 100 pennies/dollar = $62.00 


$62.00
"
"Okay, so Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles each, so that's 5 times 50 which is 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more, so she has 250 plus 20, which equals 270 marbles.


270 

"
"Okay, so Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half that, which is 3 trees. Harry has twice the number Ferdinand has, which is 6 trees, plus 5 more, so he has 11 trees.  That means Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.


8 

"
"Okay, so Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than that, so she has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.  To find out how much they have together, we add up all their money: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.


$400 

"
"Okay, so the house costs $350,000.  But there's also a 5% fee for the broker, which is like a helper who finds the house for you.  That's $350,000 times 0.05, which is $17,500.

Then there's a transfer fee, which is 12% of the price. That's $350,000 times 0.12, which is $42,000.

So, all together the extra fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

That means the total price of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Mrs. Cruz only wants to spend $400,000, so she's $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 over budget.


$9,500

"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees, like 3% for transfer stuff and 5% to the broker who helped him sell it. That's $12,000 for the transfer and $20,000 for the broker.

He also had to pay back the rest of the money he owed on the house, which was $250,000.

So, let's add up all the money he spent: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Now, subtract that from the money he got from selling the house: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

Mr. Tan made $118,000 after paying everything.


$118,000
"
"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees, so that's like 20 times 0.40 which is 8 more minutes.  

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes. 


51
"
"Okay, so he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and he got 50 of those, so that's 50 times 5 which is $250.  Then the TV ads cost $75 each and he got 15, so that's 15 times 75 which is $1125.  To find the total, we add those together: $250 plus $1125 is $1375.


$1375
"
"Okay, so the juggler has 16 balls, and half are golf balls, which is 16 divided by 2, so that's 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, so that's 8 divided by 2, which equals 4.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mary has three bags of M&Ms. The first one has 300, the second one has 12 more than that, so that's 300 + 12 = 312.  The third bag is ripped, so it only has half the M&Ms of the first bag, which is 300 / 2 = 150.

To find the total, we add them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762


762 

"
"Okay, so John has two houses, and each house has three bedrooms.  If each bedroom has two windows, that's 2 houses * 3 bedrooms/house * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows.

But wait, there are also 4 extra windows in each house, so that's 2 houses * 4 windows/house = 8 more windows.

Adding those together, there are 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows in total.


20 

"
"Okay, so she spent $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

If she paid with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so the sweater body needs 900 stitches. The collar needs 1/10 of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette is double the collar, so that's 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

That means the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so each sleeve uses (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.


315 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.  She also got 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, which is 80 * $30 = $2400.  To find the total, we add those together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.


$3200
"
"Okay, so Sean has a lot to learn! His song has 54 lines.  The first scene is double the song, so that's 54 x 2 = 108 lines. But he only says a third of those, which is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene is 6 more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60 lines. He says most of those, 4 out of every 5, so that's 60 x (4/5) = 48 lines.

To find the total, we add up all his lines: 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

138 

"
"Okay, so Carly starts with 80 cards.  

First, we figure out how many have the letter A: 80 divided by 5 is 16, and then times 2 is 32 cards.

That leaves 80 minus 32, which is 48 cards.

Half of those have B: 48 divided by 2 is 24 cards.

That leaves 48 minus 24, which is 24 cards.

Then 5 out of 8 of those have C: 24 divided by 8 is 3, and then times 5 is 15 cards.

So, 24 minus 15 is 9 cards left. Those must have the letter D!

"
"Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes for each small hole and he's digging 30 of those. That's 3 times 30, which is 90 minutes.

For the big holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 minutes.

Now we add those together: 90 plus 150 is 240 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is 240 divided by 60, which is 4 hours.

"
"If their ages add up to 20 now, and in 10 years they'll both be older, we just need to add 10 to each of their ages.  That means their combined age will go up by 20!

So the answer is 40. 

"
"Okay, so Ruby is way older than Sam right now.  In 9 years, Ruby will be three times Sam's age.  

Let's see... if Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, that means if Sam is 1, Ruby is 6.  

But in 9 years, Ruby will be 6 + 9 = 15 years old. And Sam will be 1 + 9 = 10 years old.

Hmm, 15 isn't three times bigger than 10. Let's try if Sam is 2 years old now. Then Ruby is 12.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 21 and Sam will be 11. Nope, still not three times.

Wait! If Sam is 6 years old now, Ruby is 36.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 45 and Sam will be 15.  That's right, 45 is three times 15!

So Sam is 6 years old now.

"
"Okay, so Peter bought 20 popsicles and each one cost 25 cents.  That's 20 times 0.25, which is $5.00. He also got 4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each, so that's 4 times 0.50, which is $2.00.  To find the total, we add those together: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so a cobra has 70 spots and that's double the spots a mamba has.  That means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas with 35 spots each, so they have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.


2450
"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed a lot of people! Let's see... 12 players times 2 guests each is 24 guests.  Then there are 3 coaches too, so that's 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people total.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so she needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza is $15, then 13 pizzas will cost 13 * $15 = $195.


$195 

"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  Her necklaces are 25 inches long, so the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Each bead is 1/4 inch long, so she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.


68 

"
"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. That's 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories in the first week.

Then they doubled their stories in the second week. So Alani wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

That means they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories in the second week.

 Altogether, they wrote 120 + 240 = 360 stories.

"
"Ann's brother is 18 now because he's twice her age.  In three years, he'll be 21.

"
"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 5 times 25, which is 125 cents.  She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 cents.  

So she has 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

The pop costs 55 cents, so she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.


90 

"
"Okay, so there are 76 stars total.  

Three rows have 8 stars each, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 stars.

Two rows have 6 stars each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 stars.

That means 24 + 12 = 36 stars are in those rows.

So, 76 - 36 = 40 stars are in the rows with 5 stars each.

Since each row has 5 stars, there are 40 / 5 = 8 rows of 5 stars. 


8
"
"Okay, so they need to move 80 flagstones and each one is 75 pounds. That means all the flagstones weigh 80 times 75, which is 6000 pounds.  

The trucks can only carry 2000 pounds each, so they'll need 6000 divided by 2000, which is 3 trucks.


3 

"
"Okay, so the fast car goes 60 miles every hour.  The slow car only goes 30 miles every hour, which is half as fast. If the fast car goes 480 miles, it takes it 8 hours (because 480 / 60 = 8).

Since the slow car is half as fast, it would take twice as long to go the same distance. So, the slow car would take 16 hours.


16 

"
"Okay, so Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less, which is 17 medals.  That means together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says they have 10 times *less* medals than the total given out. So to find the total, we do 39 x 10 = 390.


390 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total. The adults get 24 of them, which leaves 16 for the kids.  If there are 8 kids, each kid gets 2 chocolate bars.

"
"Okay, so Susan works for 3 hours, but she takes a 30 minute break. That means she actually works for 2 and a half hours.  

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 and a half hours is 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

She makes $5 every 10 minutes, so she makes 150 / 10 = 15 groups of $5.

That means she earns 15 * $5 = $75.


$75 

"
"Okay, so Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has double Mike's points, which is 42 points.

After the third round, they have 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points total.

Mike and Tony both get an extra point because they have more than 20 points. So now they have 81 + 1 + 1 = 83 points. 


83
"
"Okay, so Will has 15 oranges. His oldest son washes 8 oranges because he's 8 years old. His little brother is 4, so he washes 4 oranges.  That's 8 + 4 = 12 oranges washed.  

That means there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left.

"
"Okay, so Darren does a lot of exercises!

* Day 1: He does 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.
* Day 2: He does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups, 50 - 10 = 40 squats, and 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses. That's 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

* Total:  170 + 200 = 370 exercises in two days! 


370
"
"Okay, so they eat 1 kg of rice for lunch and 1 kg for dinner, that's 2 kg a day.  The big bag has 42 kg, so it will last them 42 divided by 2, which is 21 days.  That's 3 weeks!


3 

"
"Okay, so Sam wanted to sell 120 crates of bread. He couldn't sell any on Monday or Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell bread.

He sold 20 crates on the weekend, then 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday.  Let's add those up: 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

To see how far off he was, we subtract what he sold from his goal: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates off from his target. 


55
"
"Okay, so Carmen starts at $200. Then three other people bid, and each time the price goes up by $50.  So that's $50 times 3, which is $150 more.  

That means the desk ends up costing Carmen $200 + $150 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, that's 60 miles a day. He works 5 days a week, so that's 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles a week.

He works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles a year.

Each mile costs $2, so that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for the year just for the miles.

He also gives his driver $150 extra each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 extra.

In total, he pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 a year for driving. 


$31,800
"
"Okay, so Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday put together.  

He exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 minutes on Monday. That's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total.

To exercise twice that amount on Tuesday, he needs to exercise for 39 x 2 = 78 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Elise sold 45 books this year, and she has 50 left. That means she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books already.

She sold twice as many in the first year as this year, so she sold 45 * 2 = 90 books in the first year.

That means she sold 200 - 90 = 110 books in the second year.

Each book costs $20, so she made 110 * $20 = $2200 in the second year.


$2200 

"
"Okay, so Watson works a lot! 10 hours a day is a long time.

He makes $10 each hour, so that's $100 a day.

He works 5 days a week, so that's $100 x 5 = $500 a week.

Plus, he gets a bonus of $300 every week because his company is doing good.

So, that's $500 + $300 = $800 a week.

April has 4 weeks, so he makes $800 x 4 = $3200 in April.


$3200 

"
"Okay, so John won 80% of his matches. That means he won 80 out of every 100 matches.  Since he wrestled 20 people, he won 16 matches (80% of 20).  That means he lost to 4 people.


4 

"
"Okay, so they make 60 loaves of bread. They sell 40 in the morning, which is like two-thirds of them. That leaves 20 loaves.  Then they sell half of those in the afternoon, so that's 10 loaves.

"
"Joey loses 2 pounds each week because 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.  Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose the same amount as Joey loses in one week, so it will take her 4 weeks.

"
"Okay, so the ice cream is cheaper by $2 each, and you're buying two, so that's $2 x 2 = $4 saved on ice cream.

The milk is $0.50 cheaper each, and you're getting four, so that's $0.50 x 4 = $2 saved on milk.

In total, you save $4 + $2 = $6.

"Okay, so the serum gives you an extra arm every 3 days, and an extra leg every 5 days.  

If you drink it, after 15 days you'd have 15 / 3 = 5 new arms.

And for legs, you'd have 15 / 5 = 3 new legs.

That's a total of 5 + 3 = 8 new limbs!

"
"Okay, so Theo has $6000. He spends $600 on suits, $150 on suitcases, and his plane ticket costs $1200 (that's like five times the price of a suit plus $700 more!).

That's a total of $1950 spent already. He wants to save $2000, so he has $4050 left ($6000 - $1950 = $4050).

That means he has $2050 left for gifts!


$2050
"
"Okay, so there are three people who eat 3 eggs each, so that's 3 times 3 which is 9 eggs. Then there are 2 people who eat 2 eggs each, so that's 2 times 2 which is 4 eggs.  

That means they eat a total of 9 plus 4, which is 13 eggs every day. In a week, that's 13 times 7, which equals 91 eggs.

"
"Okay, so Quinn is 30. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so she's 27. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so he's 32.

"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, so six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.

The problem says Chile's population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000 people.

But that was six years ago, and it says that was only half the population now. So now, Chile has 60000 * 2 = 120000 people.


120000 

"
"Okay, so there are 105 players in total.  The offense has twice as many players as the defense, and the special teams has half as many as the defense.  

Let's think about it like this: if we knew how many players were on defense, we could figure out the rest. Let's say there are ""d"" players on defense.

* Offense would be 2 * d
* Special teams would be d / 2

If we add all those together, it should equal 105:  d + 2d + d/2 = 105

To make the math easier, let's make all the ""d""s the same. We can multiply everything by 2: 2d + 4d + d = 210

Now combine the ""d""s: 7d = 210

To find out what ""d"" is, divide both sides by 7: d = 30



So there are 30 players on defense. 

"
"Okay, so Martha invited a bunch of people. Let's see... 2 families with 6 people each is 2 times 6, which is 12 people. Then 3 families with 4 people each is 3 times 4, which is also 12 people. So that's 12 plus 12, which is 24 people invited.

But then 8 people got sick, and 8 divided by 4 is 2 more people who couldn't come. So that's 8 plus 2, which is 10 people who couldn't make it.

That means 24 minus 10 is 14 people came to the party.


14 

"
"Okay, so Solomon starts with 50 marbles. Then he gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His dad gives him 2/5 times the amount he got from Johanna, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now he has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, all his marbles weigh 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.


156 

"
"Okay, so the pool is like a big box, right?  To find out how much it costs to fill, we gotta figure out how much water it holds.

It's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, so we multiply those together: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120.  That means it holds 120 cubic feet of water.

Since it costs 10 cents for every cubic foot, we multiply that by 120: 120 x $0.10 = $12.00


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  There are 3 times as many girls, so there are 30 x 3 = 90 girls. There are 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, so there are 30 / 10 = 3 nongendered kids.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids.


123 

"
"Okay, so they need 3 wires for every 1 pole.  If they need 45 wires, that means they need 45 / 3 = 15 poles.


15 

"
"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party.  That's 40 people total. Then a quarter of them left, which is 10 people (40 / 4 = 10).

That means 30 people stayed (40 - 10 = 30). We know 22 guys stayed, so the rest must be girls.  

There are 8 girls left (30 - 22 = 8).


8 

"
"Okay, so the book costs $4, and the magazine is half that price.  That means the magazine costs $2. The pen is $1 cheaper than the magazine, so it costs $1. 


$1
"
"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils, and 2 of them aren't in boxes. That means she has 24 pencils in 3 boxes, so each box has 8 pencils.  

She and her sister have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils total.

Since each box holds 8 pencils, they need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.


9 

"
"Okay, so Shannon wants her iced coffee super cold.  Each ice cube makes it colder by 13 degrees, so she needs 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes.

Each ice cube also makes the coffee weaker by 12 milliliters, so 5 ice cubes make it weaker by 5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters.

And don't forget the cream! That's another 15 milliliters weaker.

So in total, her iced coffee is 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters weaker.


75 

"
"Okay, so they got 7 new records, and you need 2 old ones to get a new one.  That means they traded in 7 times 2, which is 14 old records.


14 

"
"Okay, so there are 100 programmers in total.  

We know 40 of them are junior programmers because 2/5 of 100 is 40.

Junior programmers make $2000 each, so they cost the company 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 each.

There are 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers.

So, the senior programmers cost the company 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of junior and senior programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.


224000 

"
"Okay, so 20 people were on the bus before the last stop. Then 7 people got off, so there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus.  Before that stop, 8 people got on, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people. And 5 people got on at the first stop, so there were 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the beginning.

"
"Okay, so Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, so he has 22 left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, leaving him with 8.  He buys 28 more on the way home (that's double the 14 he gave away!). Now he has 36! He eats 3 that night, so he has 33. Then he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 31 lollipops.


31 

"
"Okay, so the phone is at 60% and needs to get to 100%. That means it needs 40% more charge.

It charges 1% every 3 minutes, so to get 40% it'll take 40 times longer than 3 minutes.  That's 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.


2 

"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and gets 10 more, so she has 17 lollipops. Then she gives 3 away, leaving her with 14.


14 

"
"Okay, so they spent $80 last time and get $1 off for every $20, so they earned $80 / $20 = $4 in rewards.

Then they used the $4 rewards and a coupon for double that, so that's $4 * 2 = $8 more off.

Their stuff cost $43, and they saved $4 + $8 = $12 total.

So they paid $43 - $12 = $31.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $15 times 2000 which is $30,000. But then they take out 20% for taxes, so that's $30,000 times 0.20 which is $6,000 in taxes.  So Job A leaves you with $24,000.

Job B pays $42,000 straight up, but they take out $6,000 for property tax first. That leaves $36,000. Then they take out 10% for taxes, so that's $36,000 times 0.10 which is $3,600. So Job B leaves you with $32,400.

Job B pays $8,400 more than Job A.


$8,400
"
"Okay, so there are 220 castles in Scotland, and 40% of them are ruins. That means there are 220 * 0.40 = 88 ruined castles.

Half of those ruined castles are unmanned, so there are 88 / 2 = 44 unmanned ruined castles.

"Okay, so Furniture United wants $1350 first and then $350 every month for 6 months. That's $350 times 6 which is $2100.  So that's $2100 plus the $1350, which is $3450 in total.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 first and then $250 every month for 9 months. So that's $250 times 9 which is $2250.  Then add the $1100, and that's $3350.

To find the difference, we do $3450 minus $3350, which is $100.


100 

"
"Okay, so they have 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 guns total.  If they split them evenly, each person gets 24 / 4 = 6 guns.

"
"Okay, so Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers, and he's making 8 batches. That's 30 times 8, which is 240 ounces.

Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.

So in total, he needs 240 plus 70 ounces, which is 310 ounces of sugar.

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 times 8 equals $64.

The first year, the price goes up 50%, which is half of $8, so that's $4 more per share. Now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

So, her shares are worth 8 times $12, which is $96.

But then the price goes down 25% the next year. That's $12 times 0.25, which is $3 less per share.

So now each share is worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Finally, her shares are worth 8 times $9, which is $72.


$72 

"
"Okay, so Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times that, so he ate 2 x 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"
"Okay, so there are 200 students in total.  Two groups are the same size, and the third group is 10 smaller.

Let's think of it like this: if we take those 10 students and add them to the smaller group, all three groups would be the same size.

So, 200 + 10 = 210 students would be split evenly into three groups.

That means each of the bigger groups would have 210 / 3 = 70 students.

Since the smallest group is 10 less, it has 70 - 10 = 60 students.



**Answer:** 60 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and we know there are twice as many chickens as cows.  

Let's see... if we think of the cows as one group and the chickens as another, those two groups have to add up to 60 animals. Since there are twice as many chickens, the chicken group is bigger.

Hmm, if we split the animals into three equal groups, each group would have 20 animals (60 / 3 = 20).  

That means there are 20 cows (one group) and 40 chickens (two groups).

Cows have 4 legs, so all the cows have 80 legs (20 x 4 = 80). Chickens have 2 legs, so all the chickens have 80 legs (40 x 2 = 80).

In total, all the animals have 160 legs (80 + 80 = 160).


160 

"
"Okay, so Josh starts with 3 balls. Then he adds one more each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.

But then he drops 3!  Two come back, so he has 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls left.


5 

"
"Okay, so the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  The beetle and toad are the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds. The snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, so it's 60 pounds. The bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

If we add up all the animals, it's 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

But don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds too! So the total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.


210 

"
"Okay, so Laurel got 24 outfits at first. Then she got twice that at her shower, which is 24 x 2 = 48 outfits.  That's a lot of clothes!

Then her mom gave her 15 more. So in total, she has 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits.


87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, so that's 5000 divided by 5 which is 1000 more meters.

So now he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.

June has 30 days, so he runs 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180000 meters in June.


180000 

"
"Okay, so Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, which is $4. So Juice Box B is $4 + $5 = $9.

Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so it's $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract: $11 - $9 = $2.


$2 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 tables with 4 legs each, that's 40 times 4 which equals 160 legs. Then there are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 50 times 3 which is 150 legs.  To find the total, we add those together: 160 plus 150 equals 310 legs.


310 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys a bag of 36 cookies. Her son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie every day for a week, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.  

Together they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

That means Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. 


9
"
"Okay, so each shirt cost $30, but he got 40% off.  That means each shirt was $30 - ($30 x 0.40) = $18.

Since he bought two shirts, he paid $18 x 2 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors. Now they make $1100 a day selling silos.  That's $100 more each day.

To find the percentage, you do (the difference / the old amount) times 100.

So, ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

They're making 10% more now. 


10
"
"Okay, so Madeline spends $25 each week on dog food, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 x 4 = $100 on food each month.

Then she spends $20 on treats each month and $100 on medicine each month.

To find out how much she spends in a year, we add up her monthly costs: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 per month.

Finally, we multiply that by 12 months to get the yearly cost: $220 x 12 = $2640.


2640 

"
"Okay, let's see...

* Yoga is one hour.
* Cooking class is three times longer than yoga, so that's 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.
* Cheese tasting is half an hour.
* The museum tour is half as long as the cooking class, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* Errands take 2 hours.

Adding it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours


8 

"
"Okay, so they need 30 pots for the daisies and double that for the roses, which is 30 x 2 = 60 pots.  That's a total of 30 + 60 = 90 pots.  Since April already has 100 pots, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots leftover.


10 

"
"Okay, so Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater, and then gave her brother $4.  To find out how much she saved, we need to add up what she spent and then subtract that from what she started with.

$11 + $4 = $15

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21.


$21
"
"Okay, so John did a bunch of stuff on vacation. He boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 shows that were each 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours of shows.

That's a total of 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.

We know that's only 30% of his whole vacation. To find out how long his whole vacation was, we can divide 15 hours by 0.30 (which is the same as 30%). That gives us 50 hours for his whole vacation.

He spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so we multiply 50 hours by 0.40, which equals 20 hours.


20 

"
"Okay, so Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400 and already has $80.  

She makes $10 an hour at her first job and worked 20 hours, so she earned $10 * 20 = $200.

At her second job, she makes $5 an hour and worked 15 hours, so she earned $5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she made $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

She still needs $400 - $355 = $45 to buy the phone.


$45 

"
"Okay, so the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the next one is 5 feet taller than that, so it's 11 feet.  

Together, those two trees are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.

The tallest tree is twice that size, so it's 17 x 2 = 34 feet tall.


34 

"
"Okay, so Dean started with $28. The cars cost 6 times $2, which is $12. The bears cost 5 times $1, which is $5.  So all together he spent $12 + $5 = $17.

That means he had $28 - $17 = $11 left. Then his mom gave him $10 more, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Morgan has $90 and she needs to pay for herself too. Mini-golf is $5, arcade tokens are $5, and go-karts are $20 (because she wants to ride twice). That's $30 for Morgan.

So she has $60 left for her friends. Since each friend costs $30, she can invite 2 friends. 


2 

"
"Marisa gets $5 each day and spends $1 on lollipops. That means she saves $4 every day.  If she does that for 5 days, she'll save $4 x 5 = $20.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Billy had $10 and spent some on candy.  We know gumballs cost 5 cents each and he bought 40, so those cost him $2.00 (40 x $0.05 = $2.00).

That means he had $8.00 left after buying candy ($10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00). He spent half of that on candy, so the candy cost $4.00 ($8.00 / 2 = $4.00).

Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he bought 2.67 pounds of candy ($4.00 / $1.50 = 2.67 pounds).


2.67 

"
"Okay, so Carver is 45.  That's 5 years less than double his son's age.  To find the son's age, we can think of it like this:

* If Carver was twice his son's age, he'd be double the son's age.
* Since he's 5 years *less* than double his son's age, we need to add 5 to 45.

45 + 5 = 50

* Now we know double the son's age is 50.
* To find the son's age, we divide 50 by 2.

50 / 2 = 25


25 

"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles then 100 miles, that's 175 miles. Then it goes 50 miles less coming back, so that's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

So one whole trip is 175 + 125 = 300 miles.

It does that three times a day, so that's 300 x 3 = 900 miles a day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 / 900 = 20 days before needing service.


20 

"
"Okay, so a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing because it's right in the middle of a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds).

That means for the chihuahuas, he needs 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.

For the collies, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, he needs 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing.


23 

"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, but then he has to go 10 extra miles because of a detour. That means he drives 210 miles going there. He goes 70 miles per hour, so that takes him 210 / 70 = 3 hours.

Then he drives back home, which is 240 miles, and he goes 80 miles per hour. That takes him 240 / 80 = 3 hours.

So the whole trip takes 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours. 


6
"
"Okay, so there are 96 kids in fourth grade, and 43 are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  

Then 4 boys were out sick, so 53 - 4 = 49 boys were at school.


49 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, which means there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  

To find the total, we add the boys and girls: 12 + 6 = 18 kids.


18 

"
"Okay, so Jane needs 42 points to pass. She already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test.


9 

"
"Okay, so 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then 3 times 4 is 12, and 12 minus 5 is 7 people who got kicked out for stealing.  That's a lot of shoplifters!  Then 7 times 3 is 21 people who got into fights.  So that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people in total for those reasons.

If 50 people got kicked out, then 50 - 31 = 19 people got kicked out for other stuff.


19 

"
"Okay, so Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara.  Sara has 8 points, so Erin had 8 x 3 = 24 points before she scored more.  Then she scored 14 more, so she had 24 - 14 = 10 points before.


10
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much all the senior gifts will cost.

First, the picture frames cost $20 each, and there are 44 seniors, so that's 44 times $20, which is $880.

Then, each frame needs etching, which costs 20% more.  That means each etching costs $20 times 0.20, which is $4. So, etching all the frames costs 44 times $4, which is $176.

Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so that's 2 times $5, which is $10.

Now, a quarter of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 divided by 4, which is 11 officers. Each officer gets a cord that costs $12, so that's 11 times $12, which is $132.

Finally, to find the total cost, we add up all the costs: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.



$1198
"
"If Ethan makes his own wallpaper, he saves $80. That means it would cost him $320 to make it himself.


$320
"
"Okay, so they sold 14 shoes on Friday. Then on Saturday, they sold twice that amount, which is 14 times 2, or 28 shoes. On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so that's 28 divided by 2, which is 14 shoes. But then 6 people returned their shoes, so they actually sold 14 minus 6, or 8 shoes on Sunday.

To find the total, we add up the shoes sold each day: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 shoes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she dances twice as long as Tuesday, so that's 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.

To find the total, we add up all the hours: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so they bought a bunch of stuff worth $400,000, but 40% of it was broken.  That means they had to send back 40/100 * $400,000 = $160,000 worth of stuff.

So, they spent $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000 on the stuff that actually worked.


$240,000 

"
"Okay, so Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each, and the other half give 2 kg each.  

That means 15 sheep give 1 kg of milk, so that's 15 kg total.

The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, so that's 30 kg total.

If you add those together, Mary gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens.  She cuts each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so that's 6 times 8, which is 48 pieces.


48 

"
"Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 kids.  That leaves 40 - 20 = 20 kids who like other colors.

If a fourth of those kids like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 kids.

That means 20 - 5 = 15 kids like yellow.


15 

"
"Okay, so Lucy made $56 selling apples on Monday, and each apple costs $4. That means she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples on Monday.

Then she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, and double that on Wednesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

To find the total, we add up all the apples: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.


50 

"
"Okay, so Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 10 times 2, or 20 socks.  Then she washed 15 more socks that weren't in pairs. That's a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

If she started with 50 socks and washed 35, she's missing 50 - 35 = 15 socks.


15
"
"Rachel had 23 cookies and got 42 more, so that's 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  Then her brother ate 44, so she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.


21
"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed some money and has to pay it back with extra money called interest.  

First, we gotta figure out how much extra she has to pay because of the interest. It's 10% of the money she borrowed, which is $3650. So, 10% of $3650 is like 10/100 times $3650, which equals $365. But she borrowed the money for five months, so we multiply that by 5: $365 times 5 equals $1825.

Now, she has to pay back the original amount plus the interest, so that's $3650 + $1825 = $5475.

Finally, to find out how much she pays each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $5475 divided by 5 equals $1095.


Answer: 1095 

"
"Okay, so Cho hiked for a long time! 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours is a lot of walking. That's 14 times 8, which is 112 kilometers. Chloe only hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers an hour. So she hiked 9 times 5, which is 45 kilometers.  To find out how much farther Cho hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 minus 45 equals 67.


67 

"
"Okay, so Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has double his silver pesos, which is 50 x 2 = 100 silver pesos.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

To find the total, we add up all the silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos. Then we add up all the gold pesos: 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Finally, we add the silver and gold pesos together: 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.


350 

"
"Okay, so Millie spends $18 on stuff to make the lemonade.  She can make 36 cups (3 pitchers times 12 cups each). If she sells each cup for a dollar, she'll make $36.  

That means she makes $18 in profit ($36 - $18).  She sells 4 cups every hour, so she has enough lemonade to sell for 9 hours (36 cups / 4 cups per hour).

So, she makes $2 profit every hour ($18 / 9 hours).


$2 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left, and that's 2 out of 5 of his land.  To find out how much he started with, we can think of it like this: if 2 parts equal 12.8 hectares, then 1 part is 12.8 divided by 2, which is 6.4 hectares.  Since he had 5 parts in total, we multiply 6.4 by 5 to get 32 hectares.


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls, so that's 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  Then half of them can't make it, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls who can't sing. That means 26 - 13 = 13 girls can sing.  And the 3 teachers sing too, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.


16 

"
"Okay, so to find Wilson's average grade, we gotta add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

400 / 5 = 80

His math grade is an 80! 

"
"Okay, so 6 erasers cost 6 times $2, which is $12.  And 8 pencils cost 8 times $3, which is $24.  If you add those together, 12 plus 24 equals $36.


36 

"
"Okay, so James delivers a bunch of messages to Ms. Thompson, 66 to be exact. Then he delivers way fewer to Mr. Yu, only a third of that amount.  So that's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 messages for Mr. Yu.

To find the total, we add the messages for both teachers: 66 + 22 = 88 messages.


88 

"
"Okay, so David gets the bracelet for $30 and can ride all the rides. Dasha has to buy tickets for each ride. That's 9 rides times 2 tickets per ride, which is 18 tickets.  Since each ticket is $2, she spends 18 times 2, which is $36.

David saved $36 - $30 = $6. 


6
"
"Okay, so Monica has a bunch of gifts to wrap. Let's see... 6 for family, 4 for friends, and 2 for teachers. That's 12 gifts total.

She has 144 inches of ribbon, and she wants to use it all for bows, one for each gift.  So, if she divides the ribbon evenly, each bow can be 144 inches divided by 12 gifts, which equals 12 inches per bow.


12 

"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam have popsicles in a 5:6 ratio. That means if we split their popsicles into groups, there are 5 groups for Betty and 6 groups for Sam.

They have 165 popsicles total, and if we divide that by the total number of groups (5 + 6 = 11), we get 15 popsicles per group.

Betty has 5 groups, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 groups, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.


15
"
"Okay, so Tim is ditching cable, which is smart 'cause it's expensive!

Netflix is $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus together are usually $20, but he gets a deal for bundling them, saving 20%. That's $20 times 0.20, which is $4 off. So, Hulu and Disney Plus cost him $16.

Adding Netflix, that's $16 + $10 = $26 for all his streaming.

He was paying $60 for cable, so he saves $60 - $26 = $34!


$34 

"
"Okay, so Carol spent 4 hours writing, then half of that recording, which is 2 hours.  Then she spent 1.5 hours editing.  That's a total of 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we do (editing time / total time) times 100%. So that's (1.5 / 7.5) * 100% = 20%.


20 

"
"Okay, so Wendy has 6 rows of shelves and 6 columns, so that's 6 times 6 which is 36 spots for books.  She wants double that amount, so that's 36 times 2 which is 72 books. Then she wants 20 more on top of that, so 72 plus 20 is 92 books.


92 

"
"Okay, so Erica starts with 20 cards and her dad gives her 2 boxes of 15 cards each, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 more cards.  That means she has 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Then she gives away 24 to her classmates and 5 to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

So now she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left.

But wait! She gets 17 more from family and friends, so she ends up with 21 + 17 = 38 cards.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jenny starts with 12 slices. Bill gets 1/3, which is 4 slices, and Mark gets 1/4, which is 3 slices.  That's 4 + 3 = 7 slices gone already.

If Jenny eats 2, then there are 7 + 2 = 9 slices gone.

That leaves 12 - 9 = 3 slices left. 


3
"
"Okay, so Mark needs $300 for the bike and he already has $50. That means he needs to save $250 more.

If he makes $10 each day, he'll need to work for 25 days to save enough. 


25
"
"Okay, so Nancy saw 90 spiders.  Then she saw 90 divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes.  

Then she saw twice the number of millipedes, which is 30 times 2, which is 60. But then she saw 12 less than that, so 60 minus 12 is 48 stink bugs.

To find the total, we add up all the bugs: 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs.


168 

"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 35. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42. That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica.


12
"
"Okay, so John drinks two glasses of milk, and each glass has 8 ounces. That's 2 times 8, which is 16 ounces of milk total.  Milk has 3 calories in every ounce, so 16 times 3 is 48 calories.


48 

"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month and 6 days a week, that's 4 times 6 which is 24 days a month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 times 12 which is 288 days a year.

He makes $50 each day, so he earns 288 times 50 which is $14,400 in a year.


$14,400 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs four times the normal amount of stuff for his brownies.  That means he needs 3 cups of flour times 4, which is 12 cups of flour. Since each bag has 2 cups, he needs 12 divided by 2, which is 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup times 4, which is 4 cups.  He gets 2 cups per bottle, so he needs 4 divided by 2, which is 2 bottles of milk.

He needs 6 bags of flour minus 2 bottles of milk, which is 4 more bags of flour.

"
"Okay, so Mel saves 5 hours of AC time each day.  That means he's using it 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours a day.

His AC uses 900 watts each hour, so that's 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watts a day.

To figure out how many kilowatts that is, we divide by 1000: 2700 watts / 1000 watts/kilowatt = 2.7 kilowatts a day.

Over 30 days, he saves 2.7 kilowatts/day * 30 days = 81 kilowatts.


81 

"
"Okay, so there are two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's one with 36 stripes and another with half of that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  

In total, all the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes per zebra.


22 

"
"Okay, so Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4 people. That means he needs 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of each.

Meat costs $7 per pound, so that's 5 * $7 = $35.

Cheese costs $3 per pound, so that's 5 * $3 = $15.

In total, he'll spend $35 + $15 = $50 on meat and cheese. 


$50.00
"
"Okay, so Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, which is 40 x 2 = 80 corns.

Then he gets 60 more cannolis, so now he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 less corn than cannolis, so he has 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

In total, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

And with the new cannolis, he has 140 + 100 = 240 corns and cannolis altogether.


240 

"
"Okay, so Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps. He did half of them going to and from school, which is 10,000 divided by 2, so 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend.  That's 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps already.

He only needs 2,000 more steps to reach his goal, so he must have walked 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.


2,000
"
"Okay, so Toby has a 45 page book with 200 words on each page. That's 45 times 200, which is 9000 words total.

He reads 300 words every minute, so it'll take him 9000 divided by 300, which is 30 minutes to read the whole thing.

He needs to be at the airport in an hour, which is 60 minutes, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. So, reading and traveling takes 30 minutes plus 10 minutes, which is 40 minutes.

That means he'll be at the airport 60 minus 40, which is 20 minutes early!


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 people and paid them $15 an hour for 40 hours a week. That's like $15 times 40, which is $600 a week.  Then they worked 4 weeks in May, so that's $600 times 4, which is $2400 each person made in May.

Since there were 40 people, the company paid $2400 times 40, which is $96,000 in May.

In June, a quarter of the people left, so 40 divided by 4 is 10 people left. That means 30 people were still working.

They still made $2400 each in June, so the company paid $2400 times 30, which is $72,000 in June.

To find the total, we add the May and June paychecks: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000


$168,000 

"
"Okay, so Sally starts with $10.00. The taffy is a deal - 2 pounds cost $4.50 because the second pound is half price. The seashells are $1.50, and the magnets are $0.25 each, so those are $1.00 total.  

If she spends $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00, then she has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.


$3.00 

"
"Okay, so Tim bought one pack of fireworks for $400 and another pack that cost twice as much, so that's $400 * 2 = $800.  

That means both packs together cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

He got a 20% discount, so he saved $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

After the discount, the fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Don't forget the big finale firework that cost $150!

So in total, he spent $960 + $150 = $1110.


$1110
"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies every night, and she wants enough for a whole month, which is 30 days. That means she needs 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

Her recipe only makes 12 cookies at a time, which is a dozen. So, she needs to make 60 / 12 = 5 dozens of cookies.


5 

"
"Okay, so 1% of her candles will explode, right? That's 500 candles out of 50,000.  And then 5% of those stinky ones explode, so that's 25 candles.


25 

"
"Okay, so each blouse is normally $20, but they're 30% off.  That means each one is $6 cheaper (cause 30% of 20 is 6). So each blouse costs $14.

If she buys 4, it's $14 x 4 = $56.


$56 

"
"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, which is 15 apples.  Her sister got double the apples from the tall trees, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 apples. And she got three times the apples from the short trees, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 apples.

Together they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees.

That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.


350
"
"Okay, so we have camels and dromedaries, right? Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  

We know there are 180 heads total, and 304 humps.

Let's think about it like this: if all the animals were dromedaries, there would be 304 humps. But since there are camels with two humps, we know there are fewer dromedaries.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'm gonna have to think about it a bit more...

...

Aha! I got it! There are **56** dromedaries. 



"
"Okay, so Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first four days, so that's 200 x 4 = 800 kilometers.

Then he traveled less for two days, only 30% of the first four days, so that's 800 x 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He didn't travel at all one day, so let's add up what he did travel: 800 + 240 = 1040 kilometers.

In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, so that's 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Finally, let's add up everything: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


3140
"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is four times bigger than that, so it's 5 times 4 which is 20 cubic inches. Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's, so it's 20 times 2 which equals 40 cubic inches.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet.  To find the comb, Oliver needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.


3000 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from one bank. The other bank gave him twice that, so that's $4000 * 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

He already had $5000, so now he has $12000 + $5000 = $17000.


$17000 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 cats on the rock. Then 4 boats came and took 5 cats each, so that's 4 times 5 which is 20 cats gone.  That leaves 50 minus 20, which is 30 cats.

Then, 3 out of every 5 of those cats ran off, so that's 30 times (3 divided by 5) which is 18 cats.

So, 30 minus 18 is 12 cats left on the rock.


12 

"
"Okay, so Bill pays $8 a month for the first 6 months. That's $8 times 6, which is $48.

Then it goes up to $12 a month for 8 months. So that's $12 times 8, which is $96.

Then it goes up again to $14 a month for another 8 months. That's $14 times 8, which is $112.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256


256 

"
"Okay, so Cole got both jeans on sale, right? The tattered ones were $28, and the jogger ones were $6 cheaper, so they were $22.  

To figure out how much more the jogger jeans cost originally, we gotta think about how much he saved on each pair. He saved a total of $6, and a third of that came from the jogger jeans, which is $2. That means he saved $4 on the tattered jeans.

So, the jogger jeans were originally $22 + $2 = $24.

That means the jogger jeans were $24 - $28 = -$4 more than the tattered jeans. 


-4
"
"Okay, so they have 4 big buses that can fit 60 people each. That's 4 times 60, which is 240 people.

Then there are 6 smaller buses that hold 30 people each. So that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people.

And lastly, there are 10 vans that hold 15 people each. That's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

To find the total, we add them all up: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people.


570
"
"Okay, so Lillian made 3 bird feeders and bought 3 more.  That's a total of 6 feeders.

The feeders she made are super popular and get 20 birds each plus 10 extra, so that's 30 birds per feeder!

So her homemade feeders get 30 birds x 3 feeders = 90 birds.

The store-bought ones get 20 birds each, so that's 20 birds x 3 feeders = 60 birds.

In total, she sees 90 birds + 60 birds = 150 birds!


150 

"
"Okay, so the soup cost $4 plus 25%, which is like a quarter of $4. A quarter of $4 is $1, so the soup was $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, so it was $4 divided by 2, which is $2.  

To find the total, we add up the prices: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.


11 

"
"Okay, so Kenny wants to go to the amusement park and needs $100. He has some extra cash, $50, so he made $50 from selling his cards.

If each card is worth $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33 cards.

He kept some cards, though, so those 33 cards are only 2 out of every 3 cards he had.  That means he started with 33 cards * 3 / 2 = 49.5 cards. Since you can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards.


50 

"
"Okay, so the caterer had enough for 18 people to have two hot dogs, which is 36 hot dogs.  He also had 18 more hot dogs, so that's 54 in total. But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted seconds.  Since he only had enough for 27 people to get two hot dogs (54 hot dogs / 2 = 27 people), that means 13 people didn't get a second hot dog (40 people - 27 people = 13 people).


13 

"
"Okay, so Indras' name has 6 letters.  Half of that is 3. Her sister's name has 4 more than that, so it has 7 letters.  

If you add the letters in both their names, it's 6 + 7 = 13 letters.


13 

"
"Okay, so Charlotte's pots and pans cost $120, the bowls are $20, and the utensils are 5 times $5, which is $25.  That's a total of $120 + $20 + $25 = $165 before the discount.

But wait, everything's 20% off!  So we gotta do 20% of $165, which is $33.

Finally, we take the original price and subtract the discount: $165 - $33 = $132.


$132.00 

"
"Okay, so Dora wants to buy stuff that costs $19 in total. She has $18.  

If she needs to buy everything, she needs $1 more.


$1 

"
"Okay, so Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur killed 3/4 of that, which is 75 dragons. Prince Walter killed twice as many as Arthur, so he killed 150 dragons.  Prince Bruce killed 1/5 of what Walter killed, so he killed 30 dragons.


30 

"
"Okay, so they split 15 gallons of gas into 5 containers, so each container has 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3).

Josey needs a quarter of a container, which is 0.75 gallons (3 / 4 = 0.75).

There are 8 pints in a gallon, so she needs 6 pints (0.75 x 8 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so George had $5 and spent 1% of it, which is like 5 cents. That means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents, so that's 3 * $0.40 = $1.20 on chips.

That means he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.


5 

"
"Ray shared 20 lollipops with his friends (25 - 5 = 20).  Since he has 4 friends, each friend gets 5 lollipops (20 / 4 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Rory starts with a 20-ounce cake and cuts it into 8 slices.  She and her mom eat 2 slices, leaving 6 slices.  If each slice weighs the same, we can figure out how much each slice weighs by dividing the total weight by the number of slices: 20 ounces / 8 slices = 2.5 ounces per slice.

Since there are 6 slices left, the remaining cake weighs 6 slices * 2.5 ounces/slice = 15 ounces.


15 

"
"Okay, so Sitti and Juris have a bunch of oranges they want to share.  Let's see... they have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges total.

And there are 6 friends plus Sitti and Juris, so that's 8 people sharing.

If they split the oranges evenly, each person gets 56 / 8 = 7 oranges.


7 

"
"Okay, so Antoine needs double the onions, which is 2 pounds times 2, so that's 4 pounds of onions.  Those cost 4 times $2, which is $8. The beef stock is 2 boxes times $2, so that's $4.  All together, the stuff costs $8 + $4 = $12.  Since it makes 6 servings, each serving costs $12 divided by 6, which is $2. 


$2 

"
"Okay, so Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's drive, which takes 4 minutes. That means Bernadette's drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

She also wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before him.


21 

"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We know that's the length times the width.  He said the length is 3 yards, which is the same as 9 feet.  

To find the width, we do 360 square feet divided by 9 feet, which is 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.


98 

"
"Okay, so Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. That's 1 * 20 = 20 red beads and 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads. So she has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. That's 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads and 4 * 20 = 80 red beads. So she has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.


80
"
"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  The oven makes it hotter by 5 degrees every hour, and he bakes for 3 hours, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 degrees hotter.

Now the house is 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

But then he opens the window, and it cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. He has the window open for 30 minutes, which is like 3 sets of 10 minutes.

So it cools down 2 x 3 = 6 degrees.

That means the final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees. 


49
"
"Okay, so Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes.

James is faster swimming, so he takes 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes. But he's slower on the bike by 5 minutes, so that's 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 - 10 = 160 minutes total.

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


**Answer:** 39 

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1 hour and 15 minutes long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it's 80 minutes divided by 4. That's 20 minutes!


20
"
"Okay, so Michael's horse eats half a bale of hay for every mile it runs.  It runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour, so let's figure out how far it goes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes is half an hour.  If it runs 32 miles in a whole hour, it runs 32 / 2 = 16 miles in half an hour.

That means it eats 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so 8 bales cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, so he has 6 * $5 = $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left over. 


$6
"
"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, and a dozen has 12 eggs, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 eggs.  Then she has 2 more, so she has 50 eggs total.

Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses.

If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, which is 2 trays.


2 

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, so he has 214 + 26 = 240 points. Marcy has 225 and gets 10 more, so she has 225 + 10 = 235 points.  Joey has 240 - 235 = 5 more points than Marcy.


5 

"
"Okay, so the salesman bought the sneakers for $576.  He made $340 from the sale on Monday. Then he sold the rest for $25 each, and that's 31 sneakers times $25, which is $775.  So he made a total of $340 + $775 = $1115.

If he made $1115 and spent $576, his profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.


$539 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice has two types of crayon packs.  Six packs have 8 crayons each, so that's 6 times 8 equals 48 crayons. The other four packs have 16 crayons each, so that's 4 times 16 which equals 64 crayons.  

To find the total, we add those together: 48 plus 64 equals 112 crayons.


112 

"
"Okay, so the super ticket is $20, but you get popcorn and a soda for just $1 more. That means the super ticket is $21 total.

If you didn't get the super ticket, you saved $2, so you spent $21 - $2 = $19.

The movie ticket is $12, and the soda is $3, so the popcorn must cost $19 - $12 - $3 = $4.


$4 

"
"Okay, so they started out paying $45 for each balloon. Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon costs $65 now.  If Bentley buys 170 balloons, it'll cost him $65 times 170, which is $11050.


$11050 

"
"Okay, so the car goes 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it goes 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so that's another 30 miles.  

In total, it went 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

It drove for 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we do 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3, leaving her with 5.  Those are worth 5 times $800, which is $4000. She got 2 rubies in the trade, and those are worth 2 times $1200, so that's $2400.  If you add those together, she has $4000 + $2400 = $6400 worth of jewels.


$6400 

"
"Okay, so Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, so together they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples every day.  

If they eat 8 apples a day, in 30 days they'd eat 8 x 30 = 240 apples.


240 

"
"Okay, so Bob has 10 garden beds, and each one is like a big box.  They're 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  That means each box can hold 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet of dirt.

Since he has 10 boxes, he needs 32 x 10 = 320 cubic feet of dirt total.

Each bag of dirt has 2 cubic feet in it, so he'll need 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

If each bag costs $12, then all that dirt will cost 160 x $12 = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  There are 60% more green cards than red cards, so that's 15 x 0.60 = 9 more green cards.

That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

There are as many yellow cards as red and green cards combined, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards. 

78 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 fairies at first. Then 25 more came, so there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  But then 30 flew away, so there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left.


45 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 puppies + 12 puppies = 20 puppies in total.

Out of those, 3 puppies + 4 puppies = 7 puppies have spots.

To find the percentage, we do (7 puppies / 20 puppies) * 100 = 35%

So 35% of the puppies have spots. 


35
"
"Okay, so the farmer has a lot of feed to move! Let's see...

* He's got 2 boxes of sugar cubes, which isn't much, probably like 2 pounds.
* Then there's 4 bags of carrots, and each bag is 12 pounds, so that's 4 times 12, which is 48 pounds.
* The hay is a lot - 42 bales times 75 pounds each... hmm, that's 3150 pounds!
* And finally, the oats are 20 sacks times 65 pounds, so that's 1300 pounds.

Now, to find out how many trips he needs, we add up all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he needs to make 4500 divided by 2250, which is 2 trips.

"
"Okay, so Grayson gets 2 cents for each can and she drinks 3 cans, so that's 3 times 2 which is 6 cents.  She gets 3 cents for each bottle and drinks 5, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 cents.  

That means she makes 6 + 15 = 21 cents each week.

In a month, which is 4 weeks, she makes 21 times 4 = 84 cents.


84 

"
"Okay, so Toni has way more plants than Frederick. Frederick has 10, and Toni has 60% more than that.  60% of 10 is 6, so Toni has 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 less than Toni, so she has 9 plants.

"Leila gave Ali half of her money, which is $100 / 2 = $50.

So now Ali has $21 + $50 = $71.

"Okay, so Ashley's pizza is $15.  To figure out the tip, you divide the price by 5: $15 / 5 = $3.  

Then you add the tip to the pizza price: $15 + $3 = $18.

Ashley should give the delivery guy $18.

"
"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she goes back 5 spots, so she's in 6th place.  She moves up 2 spots, putting her in 4th. Then she goes back 3 spots to 7th. Finally, she moves up one spot to finish in 6th place.


6

"Okay, so Miss Maria has a lot of cards! Let's see... she has 6 decks of basketball cards and each deck has 25 cards, so that's 6 times 25 which is 150 cards. Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each box, so that's 5 times 40 which is 200 cards.  

That's a total of 150 plus 200, which is 350 cards! But she keeps 50 for herself, so she gives 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards to her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, then she has 300 divided by 10, which is 30 students.

"
"Okay, so Becky spent $8.00 on her apples because they were 45 cents each and she got a dollar off. Kelly's apples cost $10.00 at first, but then she got 10% off, which is a dollar. So she paid $9.00.  That means Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so each room has 2 sheets, plus a comforter, that's 3 things already. Then there are 4 pillowcases 'cause it's double the sheets. And double the pillowcases is 8 towels.  So that's 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 things to wash per room.

If there are 80 rooms, we gotta multiply: 15 things/room * 80 rooms = 1200 things to wash.


1200 

"
"Okay, so Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Then he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, which is 10 more shoes (5 times 2).  So now he has 210 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 more pairs, that's 30 shoes (15 times 2). Now he has 240 shoes.

On Friday, he gets a bunch more, 30 pairs, which is 60 shoes. Now he has 300 shoes!

But then on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.  That leaves him with 120 shoes.

"
"Okay, so Mary has enough sprinkles for 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.  If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans.


4 

"
"Okay, so the pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it cost 3 * $2 - $1 = $5.  

That means the total cost was $2 + $5 = $7.

If she paid with $10, her change is $10 - $7 = $3.


$3 

"
"Okay, so there were 30 kids in the class with 10 pencils each, so that's 30 times 10 which is 300 pencils. Then they used a fifth of them, so that's 300 divided by 5, which is 60 pencils.  That means they had 300 minus 60, or 240 pencils left.

But then they used even more! They only had a third of those left at the end, so that's 240 divided by 3, which is 80 pencils.


**Answer:** 80 

"
"Okay, so Matt wants 5 cookies.  His dad said he gets half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra.  

If we take away the extra 2 cookies, that means Matt wants to eat 3 cookies from the carrot sticks (5 - 2 = 3).

That means he has to eat 6 carrot sticks because half of 6 is 3 (6 / 2 = 3).


6 

"
"Okay, so the shark is 10 feet long, which is 120 inches. The remoras are 6 inches each, and there are two of them, so they're 12 inches total.  To find the percentage, you do (length of remoras / length of shark) times 100. So, (12 / 120) times 100 equals 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so if 20 kids don't have computers, and that's one-fourth of the class, then there must be four groups of 20 kids.

So, 20 x 4 = 80 

80 

"
"Okay, so Jason has 3 weeks to break in his shoes, which is 3 times 7 days, so that's 21 days. He walks 4 days a week, so he has 21 times 4, which is 84 days to break in the shoes.  He needs to walk for 240 minutes total. So, he needs to walk 240 minutes divided by 84 days, which is about 2.86 minutes each day.

"
"Sarah bought 20 books because 300 dollars divided by 15 dollars per book is 20.  If she gives them to her 4 kids equally, each kid gets 5 books.

"
"Okay, so there are 32 kids in Gina's class.  Some have allergies, but we want to know how many don't.

Let's see... 9 kids have dairy allergies, but 3 of those also have peanut allergies. So, 9 - 3 = 6 kids are allergic to just dairy.

Then 6 kids have peanut allergies, and we already counted 3 of them, so 6 - 3 = 3 kids are allergic to just peanuts.

That means 6 + 3 + 3 = 12 kids have some kind of allergy.

If 12 kids have allergies, then 32 - 12 = 20 kids don't have any allergies.


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 3 groups of employees going, and each group has 200 people. That's 3 times 200, which is 600 employees.  Then there are 7 tour guides for each group, so that's 3 groups times 7 tour guides, which is 21 tour guides.

To find the total, we add the employees and tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621 people.


621 

"
"Okay, so the plane tickets cost $5000 each, and there are two people, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10,000.

The hotel is normally $1500 a night, but it's more expensive because it's a busy weekend.  20% of $1500 is $1500 x 0.20 = $300 more each night.

So the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per night.

They stay for 3 nights, so the hotel costs $1800 x 3 = $5400.

To find the total cost, we add the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.


$15,400 

"
"Okay, so Jasper has half the blue paint Ben has, which is 4 / 2 = 2 tubes.  He has three times the yellow paint Ben has, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tubes.  In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint.


11 

"
"Okay, so the 2010 penny is 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  To find out how much the 2010 penny weighs, we multiply: 48 grains * (3/4) = 36 grains.

Now we add the weights together: 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.


84 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to make $200, right?  And they already have $83 + $91 = $174.  

That means they still need $200 - $174 = $26.


$26
"
"Okay, so Luri has 3 times more songs than Gabriel, which is 20 songs * 3 = 60 songs.

That means Gabriel can fit 100 songs - 20 songs = 80 more songs on his player.

Luri can fit 100 songs - 60 songs = 40 more songs.

So, Gabriel can add 80 songs - 40 songs = 40 more songs than Luri.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges, which is like saying he ate (2/5) * 60 = 24 oranges.

Since he pays $10 for each orange, he gave up 24 * $10 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Jillian's shoes cost $80. Her bag cost 3 times that amount minus $20.  So, 3 times the price of her shoes is 3 * $80 = $240. Then we subtract $20: $240 - $20 = $220.

$220 

"
"Okay, so James runs 12 miles each day, and he does that for 5 days. That means he runs 12 * 5 = 60 miles every week.

If he runs 10 miles every hour, then he runs for 60 / 10 = 6 hours each week.


6 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Ben has four horses and each one eats 5 pounds of oats two times a day. That's 10 pounds a day per horse!  Since he has four horses, that's 40 pounds of oats every day.

If he needs to feed them for five days, he'll need 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he'll need 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags of oats.


4 

"
"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. That means she has 27 / 3 * 2 = 18 Pomeranians.  

Then, one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, so she has 18 / 3 = 6 girl Pomeranians.


6 

"
"Okay, so we need to find the average highest temperature.  That means adding up the temperatures and then dividing by 3 since there are three countries.

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

-30 / 3 = -10

"
"Okay, so Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray holds 24.  If he has two trays, that's 2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs.  

He has 64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs leftover.


16 

"
"Okay, so the small pizza costs $8. The big pizza costs three times that, so it's $8 x 3 = $24.  To find out how much she spent in total, we add the two prices: $8 + $24 = $32.


$32 

"
"Okay, so Heather gets 4 razors in each pack, and she buys two packs, so that's 4 razors/pack * 2 packs = 8 razors.

The razors are buy one get one free, so she's really only paying for one pack, which is $4.00.

But wait, she also has a $2.00 coupon! So the razors cost $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

That means each razor costs $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25.

To get the answer in cents, we multiply by 100, so each razor costs 25 cents. 


25
"
"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the tallest part of the pyramid is 64 inches times 9, which is 576 inches. Then you add the shortest cheerleader, so that's 576 + 60 = 636 inches.  To get the height in feet, you divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot. So 636 divided by 12 is 53 feet.


53 

"
"Okay, so Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she works. She works for 8 hours a day, so that's 8 times 5 minutes, which is 40 minutes of walking each day.

If she does that for 5 days, she walks a total of 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.


200 

"
"Okay, so Brett is 14 now, and in four years he'll be 18.  His sister Angela will be three times Brett's age then, so she'll be 18 times 3 which is 54.  But that's in four years, so right now she's 50.


50 

"
"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day and spends $6 in the morning and $2 in the afternoon. That's $6 + $2 = $8 each day.

He does this for 14 days, so he spends $8 x 14 = $112.


112 

"
"Okay, so Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges, and each box has 10 oranges, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more than that, so she brought 50 plus 20, which is 70 oranges.  Together they have 50 plus 70, which is 120 oranges.  

Each pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 divided by 3, which is 40 pies.


40 

"
"Okay, so Mark has to figure out when both places cost the same.

The first place is $200 no matter what, plus $5 for each person to eat.

The second place is $25 per person, and food is already included.

To find out when they cost the same, we need to think about how many people would make the costs equal.

Let's say there are 10 people coming.

* First place: $200 + ($5 x 10) = $250
* Second place: $25 x 10 = $250

So, if 10 people come, both places will cost the same.

"
"Okay, so Bodhi found the most bugs. David found half as many as Bodhi, and Lily found 7 more than David.  

Let's see... if they found 43 bugs total, and David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi must have found a lot!  

Hmm, if we think about it, if we take away the 7 extra bugs Lily found, and then split the rest in half, that's how many David found. Then we can double that to find out how many Bodhi found.

Let me try it out... 43 - 7 = 36.  Then 36 / 2 = 18. So Bodhi found 18 bugs!

That means David found 18 / 2 = 9 bugs.

And Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 bugs.


**Answer:** 16 

"
"Okay, so Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, which is like 1/4 of 364 yards.  That's 364 divided by 4, which is 91 yards. Her grandma used half the yarn, so that's 364 divided by 2, which is 182 yards. To find the total, we add those together: 91 + 182 = 273 yards.


273 

"
"Okay, so Cherrie has 5 friends. Two of them want a lot of gifts, 5 each! That's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts.  The other 3 friends only want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts.  

So far, she has 10 + 6 = 16 gifts.

But wait, she buys 10 more just because! That means she has 16 + 10 = 26 gifts in total.


26 

"
"Okay, so the rug is 5 feet bigger than the chair, which is 3 feet. That means the rug is 8 feet wide.  The couch is 2 feet longer than double the rug's width, so double the rug is 8 times 2, which is 16 feet. Then you add 2 feet to that, so the couch is 18 feet long.


18 

"
"Okay, so Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and those cost the same amount.  She spent $2 on grape gum and $1 on green apple gum. That's $3 total for those two.  

That means the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.

Since she got two packs of strawberry, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Frederick wants the most popsicle sticks, right?  He's gotta be smart with his money.

The 2x8 wood gives him way more sticks for his bucks.  He can get 4 of those with his $24.

Each 2x8 makes 400 sticks, so 4 of them would be 4 times that, which is 1600 sticks!


**Answer:** 1600 

"
"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. That means he needs 6 times 4, which is 24 snowshoes.  If each pair costs $12.00, then 24 snowshoes would cost 24 times $12.00.  

24 x $12.00 = $288.00


$288.00 

"
"Okay, so Janet takes the bus twice a day, and each ride costs $2.20.  That means she spends $2.20 x 2 = $4.40 every day on the bus.

If she does that for a whole week, it's $4.40 x 5 = $22.00.

But if she buys a weekly pass for $20.00, she'd save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has double the cows the farm has, so that's 30 x 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half the sheep the zoo has, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

The farm has 30 + 10 = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Together they have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Rose bought 12 onions and that's 4 times more than Sophia, so Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.

Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is 4 times more than Sophia, so Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 things.

"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. That's a lot!  He has until July, so that gives him a few months.  

To lose a pound, you gotta burn 3500 more calories than you eat. So, he needs to burn 30 pounds times 3500 calories, which is 105,000 calories in total.

If he has about 200 days until his birthday, he needs to burn 105,000 calories divided by 200 days, which is 525 calories less than he eats every day.


525 

"
"Okay, so Gerald makes $30 each day, and there are 7 days in a week, so he earns $30 x 7 = $210 for the whole week.

Then he spends $100, so he has $210 - $100 = $110 left.


$110 

"
"Okay, so Hannah runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, so she runs 8 times 0.25 which is 2 kilometers.  She needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer, so for 2 kilometers she needs 2 times 60 which is 120 ml of water.


120 

"
"Okay, so Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, which is like 20 out of every 100 dollars.  That's $100 on clothes (20/100 * $500 = $100).

So now she has $400 left. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs. That's like 25 out of every 100 dollars, which is another $100 (25/100 * $400 = $100).

That means she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the house and lot together cost $120,000.  The house is three times more expensive than the lot.  

To figure out the house price, we can think of it like this:

*  Let's say the lot costs $100.
* The house would cost 3 times that, so $300.
* Together, they would cost $400.

We need to find numbers that add up to $120,000, where the house price is three times the lot price.  

If we try making the lot cost $30,000, then the house would cost $90,000 (3 x $30,000).

$30,000 + $90,000 = $120,000!

So the house cost $90,000.


$90,000
"
"Okay, so Tara bought a bunch of bags, right?  She got 8 packs with 5 bags in each pack, so that's 8 times 5 which is 40 bags.

Each pack cost $4, and she bought 8 packs, so that's 8 times 4, which is $32.

She sold each bag for $8, and she had 40 bags, so she made 40 times 8, which is $320.

To find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the money she made: $320 - $32 = $288.


$288 

"
"Okay, so Joe throws a lot of punches!  He throws 25 each minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  That means he throws 25 times 3, which is 75 punches every round.  Since there are 5 rounds, we do 75 times 5, and that's 375 punches!


375 

"
"Suzanne made a ton of cookies! Josh made a quarter of Suzanne's amount, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made twice as many as Josh, so she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.

"
"Okay, so Ali has four ten dollar bills, which is 4 times 10, so that's $40. He also has six twenty dollar bills, so that's 6 times 20, which equals $120.  

That means he has $40 + $120 = $160 in total.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives away $160 / 2 = $80.

That leaves him with $160 - $80 = $80.

Then he spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

So, after buying dinner, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left.


$32 

"
"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.  Double that is 240 minutes. Royce takes 40 minutes longer than that, so he takes 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

"Okay, so Martha needs to make a lot of stuff!  

Let's see... each kid needs 2 skeins for a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for mittens, and 2 for socks. That's 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins per kid.

Since she has 3 kids, she needs 21 x 3 = 63 skeins of wool.

"Okay, so Chris has a ton of math problems! Let's see...

He did 12 on Monday, and then 3 times that on Tuesday, which is 12 x 3 = 36 problems.  

That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.

He had 100 to start, so he has 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he did 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

"
"Okay, so Tony picks 6 quarts an hour. Bobby picks one less, so he gets 5 quarts. Kathy picks twice what Bobby does, so she picks 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts.  

If you add them all up, they pick 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts an hour.

"
"Okay, so they baked 200 loaves. Then they sold a bunch, 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon.  That's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.

So they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. But then the store brought back 6, so they ended up with 68 - 6 = 62 loaves.


62 

"
"Okay, so Jackson has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 in each row, so that's 36 divided by 6 which equals 6 rows.  He has 24 blue tulips and fits 8 in a row, so that's 24 divided by 8 which equals 3 rows.  

To find the total, we add the rows together: 6 + 3 = 9 rows.


9 

"
"Okay, so Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to use them for three things. That means each thing gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.  To see how many batches she can make, we do 9 / (3/4) which is the same as 9 * (4/3) = 12 batches.


12 

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts every hour, and that costs $1.50 for each kilowatt. So her daily bill is 12 times $1.50, which is $18.00.

If she adds the new thing, it'll be 12 plus 2 kilowatts, so 14 kilowatts total. That's 14 times $1.50, which is $21.00 a day.

The difference is $21.00 minus $18.00, which is $3.00 more each day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, her bill will go up by $3.00 times 7, which is $21.00 more each week.


$21.00
"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  If we have 5 people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 more chairs than that, which is 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 22 x 3 = 66 chairs.  Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

That means they have a total of 20 + 64 = 84 sofas and 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

 Altogether, they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs. 

172 

"
"Okay, so Tom spent $48 total, and the CD cost $4.  That means the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.

If he didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs.


11 

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the time. That's 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Then he did 5 hours for two weeks in a row, so that's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And one week he did 6 hours.

Let's add it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours


40 

"
"Okay, so there are 48 people on the bus at first. Then 8 get off, and 5 times that many, which is 40, get on. So now there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people.

Then at the next stop, 21 people get off.  And 3 times less get on than got off at the first stop, so that's 8 / 3 = 2 people get on.

So, after the second stop, there are 80 - 21 + 2 = 61 people on the bus.

"
"Okay, so Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years, so right now he's 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 30. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, so the cousin will be 55.  But that's in 8 years!  So the cousin is 47 now. That means the cousin is 25 years older than Jame.


25 

"
"Okay, so Errol spent $1100 on the computer and $400 less on the printer, so the printer cost $700.  That means the computer and printer together cost $1800.

He spent $2400 total, and $1800 of that was on the computer and printer, so the two monitors cost $600.

If two monitors cost $600, then one monitor costs $300.


$300 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 girls and 10 boys. The boys each found 60 shells, so they found a total of 10 * 60 = 600 shells.

The girls found 600 + (4 * 60) = 600 + 240 = 840 shells.

That means each girl found 840 / 10 = 84 shells.

"Okay, so the first book is 31 mm thick, and the second one is 50 mm. The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second, so it's 45 mm thick (50 - 5 = 45). The fourth book is double the first book, so it's 62 mm thick (31 x 2 = 62).

To find the total thickness, we add them all up: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm


188 

"
"Okay, so Emma wants to make 72 vlogs this month.  She already made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

That means she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs.


18 

"
"Okay, so the dinner was $50, and we split that in half, so that's $25 each.  But my wife wants me to pay an extra $10 for the tip, so I gotta pay $25 + $10 = $35.


$35 

"
"Okay, so the oldest boy gets $6 at first. Then he gets $5 more, so he has $11. The next day he gets another $10, so now he has $21.  He spends $8, leaving him with $13.  If he triples that, he has $39!


$39 

"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month.  That means he needs to save half of that in the first half of April, and half in the second half.

So, he needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of April.

Since there are 15 days in the second half of April, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day.


$37.50 

"
"Okay, so Verna bought 3 apples for $1.50 each, so that's 3 x $1.50 = $4.50.

Then she got 5 oranges at $0.80 each, which is 5 x $0.80 = $4.00.

And lastly, she bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so that's 6 x $0.75 = $4.50.

To find the total, we add up the cost of everything: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

If she paid with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00


$7.00
"
"Jairus earns $0.80 for each task and Jenny earns $0.50. They both did 20 tasks.  

So Jairus made 20 x $0.80 = $16.00
Jenny made 20 x $0.50 = $10.00

Jairus made $16.00 - $10.00 = $6.00 more than Jenny.


$6.00
"
"Let's see... Jeff gets 4 times more than Brad, so if we think of Brad's money as 1 part, Jeff gets 4 parts. That makes a total of 5 parts.

If 5 parts equal $100, then one part is $100 divided by 5, which is $20.

Jeff gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 times $20, which is $80.


Answer: 80 

"
"Okay, so Jeff walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, so that's 6 miles each day. If he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 times 5 which is 30 miles.

"
"Okay, so Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters times 2, so that's 52 letters. Then she writes half the alphabet, which is 26 divided by 2, so 13 letters.  That's 52 plus 13, which is 65 letters. But then she writes all those letters again, so that's another 65.  

So in total, she wrote 65 plus 65, which is 130 letters.


130 

"
"Okay, so Ali calls 3 families first. Then each of those families calls 3 more, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.  Then those 9 families each call 3, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.  And then those 27 families each call 3 more, so it's 27 times 3... which is 81 families!


81 

"
"Okay, so Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's 10 * 3 = 30 pounds total.

If he weighed 70 pounds at the end and lost 30 pounds, he must have started at 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.


100 

"
"Okay, so James has 80 toys. Jonathan wants a playset that's five times bigger, so that's 80 x 5 = 400 toys.  But he needs 2 more toys to get to that number, so he has 400 - 2 = 398 toys right now.

398 

"
"Okay, so Daniel needs to buy a bunch of stuff for school. Let's see...

* Notebooks cost $1.50 each, and he wants 5, so that's 5 x $1.50 = $7.50
* Pens are $0.25 each, and he wants 2, so that's 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
* The calculator is $12.
* The geometry set is $10.

So, all together that's $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30 x 0.10 = $3.

So, the final price is $30 - $3 = $27.


$27
"
"Okay, so Carly buys 5 hamburgers that cost $4 each, so that's 5 times 4 which is $20.  Then she gets 10 packs of fries at 30 cents each.  That's 10 times 0.30 which is $3.  And she gets 5 drinks at $2 each, so that's 5 times 2 which is $10.

Now, let's add up all the costs: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

If she pays with a $50 bill, her change is $50 - $33 = $17.


$17
"
"Okay, so Antonella sold $2500 worth of stuff.  

The first $1000 she sold earns her 30%, which is $300 (cause 30/100 times 1000 is 300).

She has $1500 left over ($2500 - $1000 = $1500).  She gets 10% on that, so that's $150 (cause 10/100 times 1500 is 150).

So in total, she made $300 + $150 = $450!


450 

"
"Okay, so Bill has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles in each, so that's 2 times 24 which equals 48 bottles. He needs 2 bottles for each of his 70 guests, so that's 70 times 2 which equals 140 bottles.  He needs to buy 140 bottles minus the 48 he already has, so that's 140 minus 48 which equals 92 bottles.

92 

"
"Okay, so Ray swims a mile way faster in cold water.  

In cold water, it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile.  

In warm water, it takes him twice that time plus 2 more minutes, so that's 16 x 2 + 2 = 34 minutes per mile.

For 3 miles in cold water, it would take him 16 x 3 = 48 minutes.

For 3 miles in warm water, it would take him 34 x 3 = 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer in warm water.


54 

"
"Okay, so John makes $10 each day because he works 5 hours times $2 an hour.  That means he makes $40 every week. If he wants to save $80, it will take him 2 weeks. 


2 

"
"Wow, that's a lot for lunch! So the fish sub is $40.  The cold-cut combo is three times that, so it's $40 x 3 = $120.  

To find the total, we add those together: $40 + $120 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so there are 21 buttons in total.  Some have two holes, and some have four.  

Let's see... 21 minus 7 buttons with two holes leaves 14 buttons with four holes. That's 14 times 4, which is 56 holes.

Then there are 7 buttons with two holes, so that's 7 times 2, which is 14 holes.

Adding those together, 56 plus 14 equals 70 holes.


70 

"
"Okay, so Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, which is 24 cubic inches. That means Zack's locker is 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.

Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches.


3 

"
"Let's see... Octavia drinks half the recommended amount of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times what she does.  If Juan needs to drink 4 cups, that means he's drinking way too much now!  

To figure out how much less he needs to drink, we gotta know how much he drinks now.  Since he drinks 10 times Octavia, and Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, Juan drinks 10 times half the recommended amount.  

We don't know the recommended amount, so we'll just call it ""x"". So Juan drinks 10 * (x/2) = 5x cups.

To find out how much less he needs to drink, we subtract the recommended amount from what he drinks now: 5x - 4.




"
"Okay, so they have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, that's 3 times 10 which is 30 hamsters. Then they have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 guinea pigs.  To find the total, we add the hamsters and guinea pigs: 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.


45 

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than him, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.

Then we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Okay, so the sun starts at 32 degrees up from the ground. Then it goes up another 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours.  That's 5 times 10, which is 50 degrees.

So, 32 plus 50 is 82 degrees.


82 

"
"Okay, so James needs candles for his sons. One is 12, and the other is 8. That's 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Each pack has 5 candles, so he needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

If each pack costs $3, then he'll spend 4 * $3 = $12 on candles.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Judy read for 15 minutes every night for a week, that's 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages.

In the second week she read 100 pages, so in total she read 70 + 100 = 170 pages.


170 

"
"Okay, so Cody ate 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches.  Trevor ate 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.  That means they ate a total of 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.  If they started with 12, then there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left.


5 

"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now, and in 7 years he'll be 51.  The problem says in 7 years he'll be three times as old as his nephew.  So, if we divide Shiloh's age in 7 years by 3, we get the nephew's age in 7 years: 51 / 3 = 17.  

Since the nephew will be 17 in 7 years, he's 10 now. 

10 

"
"Okay, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for her first tooth. Then she got $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 times $1 which is $3.  For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of $1, which is $0.50 each. So that's 2 times $0.50 which is $1.

If you add it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.00


$9.00 

"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals.  Mark scored 20 less than Richie, so he scored 60 goals. Anna scored 45 less than Richie, so she scored 35 goals.  To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals.


175 

"
"Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made 21 * $4 = $84.  Liam only made $63.  That means Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week. That's 7 days.

He buys wooden figures for the first four days, and each one costs $5. So he spends 4 days * $5/figure = $20 on those.

That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50 for the rest of the week.

The plastic figures cost $2 each, so he can buy $50 / $2/figure = 25 of those.

He got 4 wooden figures and 25 plastic ones, for a total of 4 + 25 = 29 action figures.


29 

"
"Okay, so the kitten cost $200 to get fixed.  Then her shots were $20 each, and she had 3 of those, so that's $20 x 3 = $60.  Uh oh, she broke some stuff! Four vases at $12 each is $12 x 4 = $48.

Let's add it all up: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

That kitten is expensive!


308 

"
"Okay, so Ford grows 40 roses each week.  The flower shops want 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week.

That means he's short 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he's short 25 * 4 = 100 roses every month.


100 

"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000. She takes out $100 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $100 x 12 = $1200 she takes out each year.

Over two years, she takes out $1200 x 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and takes out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, so they spend $3 on bread and that makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs 30 cents for bread.  They also spend $30 on stuff like cheese, so that's $3 more per sandwich.  That means each sandwich costs $3.30 to make. They sell each one for $7, so they make $3.70 profit on each sandwich. If they sell 10, that's $3.70 x 10 = $37.00 profit!


$37.00 

"
"Okay, so Kate has a lot of crayons!  She has 3 boxes with 64 crayons in each, so that's 3 times 64, which is 192 crayons.

She makes crayon muffins with 8 crayons each, so she can make 192 divided by 8, which is 24 muffins.

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, she can make 24 times $1.50, which is $36.00.


$36.00 

"
"Okay, so Michael needs to figure out how much carpet he needs first. His room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 times 12 which equals 216 square feet.

The carpet itself costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 times $12 which is $2592.

He also needs padding, which is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 times $2, which is $432.

Taking up the old carpet costs $4 per square foot, so that's 216 times $4, which is $864.

Finally, putting the new carpet down costs $34 per square foot, so that's 216 times $34, which is $7344.

Now we add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232


$11232
"
"Okay, so Mack saw birds for a whole week. Let's add up all the birds he saw: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total birds by 7: 280 / 7 = 40 birds.

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds each day. 


40
"
"Okay, so Diane starts with 20. Then she adds half of 20, which is 10, so now she has 30.  She divides that by 5 and gets 6. Then she takes the starting number, 20, and subtracts 12, which is 8. Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8 and gets 48.


48 

"
"The brother has 2 cards.  

Together they have 7 cards.

"
"Okay, so the oven is hotter than it should be. It's off by 18 degrees when she sets it to 450.  That means it's 4% too hot.

If she wants it to be 520, we gotta figure out what 4% of 520 is.  

4% of 520 is 20.8. So she should set it to 520 minus 20.8, which is 499.2 degrees.


499.2 

"
"Okay, so the first movie is an hour and a half, which is 90 minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that's 2 times 60 minutes plus 5 minutes, which is 125 minutes.  

To find the total time, we add the two times together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.


215 

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, so we need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is.  

30% is like 30 out of 100, so we can do (30/100) * $76,000 = $22,800.

That means Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's, so it costs $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

To find the total value, we add the price of both houses: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200


Answer: 129200 

"
"Okay, so Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, which is 12 x 2 = 24 dishes. That means she brought 12 + 24 = 36 things in total.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 24 + 20 = 44 dishes. Her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 things.

Together they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.


120 

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in a box and that lasts him 45 days. That means each contact lasts him one day, right?  

Each box costs $100, but it's on sale for 10% off, so that's $10 off. So each box costs $90.

If he buys two boxes, that's $90 x 2 = $180.

He gets 90 contacts per box times 2 boxes, so that's 180 contacts.

So each contact costs $180 / 180 = $1.00 


$1.00
"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, that's 3 hours total.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours. That means John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours total.

Jill made 3 * $10 = $30. John made 7 * $10 = $70.

John made $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill. 


$40
"
"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 x 2 = 1000 calories.

Then she burns 600 calories running for an hour.  

So in total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Okay, so there are blue, red, and green jelly beans.  The blue ones are the middle amount. There are 1% less red ones than blue ones and 1% more green ones than blue ones.  If there are 4500 jelly beans total, we gotta figure out how many more green ones there are than red ones.

Let's say there are 100 blue jelly beans. That means there are 99 red ones (1% less) and 101 green ones (1% more).

But we know there are way more than 100 blue jelly beans, right?  It's 4500 total!

If 100 blue jelly beans is like a small group, we need to figure out how many of those small groups are in 4500.  

4500 divided by 300 (100 blue + 99 red + 101 green) is 15. So each small group is multiplied by 15.

That means there are 15 * 99 = 1485 red jelly beans and 15 * 101 = 1515 green jelly beans.

1515 - 1485 = 30

There are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. 



30
"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he goes up by 5 more, he'll be at 57 WPM.  To find the average, you add all three speeds together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then you divide by 3 because there are three speeds: 156 / 3 = 52.

52 

"
"Okay, so if Martin eats Cheerios he loses 1.25 pounds each week, and that's for 5 weeks, so he'd lose 1.25 times 5 which is 6.25 pounds.

If he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week for 5 weeks, so that's 1.75 times 5 which is 8.75 pounds.

To find the difference, we subtract the weight he loses from the weight he gains: 8.75 minus 6.25 equals 2.5 pounds.


2.5 

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and each of them brings 2 friends, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 friends.  That's 300 people already! Then she invited 10 more friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 8 more people.  

So in total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats. 


318 

"
"Okay, so the Dachshund weighs double the Affenpinscher, which is 10 pounds times 2, so that's 20 pounds. The Papillon is a quarter of the Dachshund's weight, so that's 20 divided by 4, which is 5 pounds.  The Mastiff is 44 times heavier than the Papillon, so that's 44 times 5, which equals 220 pounds.

220 

"
"Okay, so the boots on Amazon cost $16 plus $4 for shipping, which is $20 total. On eBay, they're $13 plus double the shipping, so that's $13 + ($4 x 2) = $21.  That means they're $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.


$1 

"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and gets twice as tall each day.  Mark's window is 20 feet up.

* Day 1: It's 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet tall.
* Day 2: It's 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet tall.
* Day 3: It's 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet tall!

So it takes **3** days. 

"
"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.  That's like two cups of mushrooms!  

If one cup has 3 grams of protein, then two cups have 6 grams of protein (3 x 2 = 6).

He eats that much every day, so in a week (7 days) he gets 6 x 7 = 42 grams of protein from mushrooms.


42 

"
"Okay, so Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if we cut his current age in half, it'll be how old he was 5 years ago.  

If he's twice as old now, he must be 10 years old.  

In 3 more years, he'll be 13! 


13
"
"Okay, so George needs two implants that cost $2000 each, so that's $2000 times 2 which is $4000.  Then he wants a fancy crown for one of them that costs an extra $500. So the implants cost $4000 plus $500 for the crown, which is $4500 total.

He already paid $600, so he still owes $4500 minus $600, which is $3900.

He makes $15 each hour at work. To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the money he owes by how much he makes per hour: $3900 divided by $15 is 260 hours.


260 

"
"Okay, so we know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, right?

One angle is like the base angle, let's call it *x*.  Another angle is double that, so it's 2*x*. And the last angle is triple the base angle, making it 3*x*.

To find out what *x* is, we add them all up: *x* + 2*x* + 3*x* = 180

That's 6*x* = 180.  If we divide both sides by 6, we get *x* = 30.

The biggest angle is 3*x*, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.


90 

"
"Okay, so Colby has a bunch of coins. Let's see how much money he has.

* He has 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 8 * 25 = 200 cents, which is $2.00.
* He has 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 6 * 10 = 60 cents, or $0.60.
* He has 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 14 * 5 = 70 cents, or $0.70.
* He has 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent, so that's 15 * 1 = 15 cents, or $0.15.

Now let's add up all his money: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Each gumball costs 5 cents, so he can buy $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs!


69
"
"Okay, so there are 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 legs. Then there are 2 cats, and they each have 4 legs too, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 legs.  Lastly, there are 10 birds, and they have 2 legs each, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.  

If you add all those up, 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.


48 

"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with 8 pounds.  He makes it 50% heavier, which is like half of 8, so that's 4 more pounds.  That makes it 12 pounds. But then he goes down 2 pounds, so he's using 10 pounds now.


10 

"
"Okay, so Steve starts with 5 games. Then he gets 1 new game each month for a whole year, that's 12 games! Plus 5 more for Christmas, so that's 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games after the first year.

The next year he gets even more games, 2 each month, so that's 24 games. Plus the 5 from Christmas, he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

In the third year, he's buying 4 games a month, so that's 48 games! Plus 5 for Christmas, he has 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

So the answer is 104. 


104
"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours. That means it travels 400 miles every hour (1200 / 3 = 400).

To go 2000 more miles, we need to figure out how many times 400 miles fits into 2000 miles.  

2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes a lot of chocolate! He can make 120 pounds in just two hours. Marissa is pretty good too, she makes three-quarters as much as Ruiz in one hour.  

If they both work for 12 hours, we gotta figure out how much they make together.

First, let's see how much Ruiz makes in an hour: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 of that, so she makes 3/4 * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

Together they make 60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour = 105 pounds per hour.

In 12 hours, they'd make 105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds!

That's a lot of chocolate!


1260 

"
"Okay, so Howard spent $8 on Monday. Then on Tuesday, he spent double that, which is $8 x 2 = $16.  On Wednesday, he spent four times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 x 4 = $64.

In total, he spent $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.


$12 

"
"Okay, so Patrick sold a lot of lemonade!

First, he sold 15 cups every hour for 4 hours, so that's 15 x 4 = 60 cups.

Each of those cups cost 50 cents, so he made 60 x $0.50 = $30.00

Then he sold 10 cups every hour for 2 hours, which is 10 x 2 = 20 cups.

Those cups cost 60 cents each, so he made 20 x $0.60 = $12.00

To find out how much he made in total, we add the two amounts: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy drives a lot!  

Let's see... his tires go around 725 times every 2 miles, and he drives 400 miles a month. So that's 400 / 2 = 200 sets of 2 miles.

Then his tires spin 200 * 725 = 145,000 times each month!

If a tire can go 10,440,000 times before it's worn out, it'll last 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months.

That's 72 / 12 = 6 years!

"
"Okay, so the big shampoo bottle costs $24.00.  It says you get 120 washes if you use 2 pumps. But Jackie only uses 1 pump each time.

That means the bottle will last her twice as long, right? So she gets 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

If the bottle has enough for 240 washes, and it costs $24.00, then each wash costs $24.00 / 240 washes = $0.10.

Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents! 


40
"
"Okay, so Joe has $50 and wants to buy a shirt and shorts. The shirt is $25 and the shorts are $35, so that's $25 + $35 = $60.  

Uh oh, that's more than he has! But wait, there's a sale! Everything is 30% off.

Let's see... 30% of $25 is $7.50, so the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

And 30% of $35 is $10.50, so the shorts are $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.

Now the total is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

That means Joe has $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left.


$8.00
"
"Okay, so Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He's making 4 dozen a day, so that's 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter each day.

If he bakes for a whole week, that's 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds of butter.

"
"Okay, so repaving Monica's street costs $194 per meter and it's 150 meters long. That means it costs $194 times 150, which is $29,100.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so repaving it would cost $194 times 490, which is $95,060.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street: $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.


$65,960 

"
"Okay, so John got $100,000 for each of the first 5 months, so that's 100,000 times 5 which is $500,000.

His research took way longer, 10 times longer, so that's 5 months times 10 which is 50 months total.

He needed more money for the rest of the time, 50 months minus the first 5 months is 45 months.

Each of those months cost 50% more, so that's half of 100,000 which is 50,000 extra.

So each of those months cost 100,000 plus 50,000 which is 150,000.

That means those extra months cost 45 months times 150,000 which is $6,750,000.

To find the total cost, we add the first 5 months to the rest: $500,000 plus $6,750,000 is $7,250,000.



$7,250,000
"
"Okay, so the first guy ate 6 ounces of steak. The second guy ate 8 beef tips, and each one was 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third guy got a big steak, a whole pound!  A pound is 16 ounces.  

So, 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat.


30 

"
"Okay, so there are 1000 people in the group and they each post 3 times a day.  That means there are 1000 times 3, which is 3000 posts every day!

March has 31 days, so we do 3000 times 31. That's 93,000 posts in the whole month!


93000 

"
"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week, and that's 2 times 52 weeks, which is 104 times a year.  Each time he uses 20 gallons of water, so that's 104 times 20, which is 2080 gallons in a whole year.

Water costs 15 cents a gallon, so 2080 times 0.15 is $312.


$312 

"
"Okay, so Scarlett spent $10 on the tank. Then she got rocks for $2.50 each, and she bought two bags, so that's $2.50 x 2 = $5.  The coral was $2 each, and she got three, so that's $2 x 3 = $6. The fish were 50 cents each, and she got 20, so that's $0.50 x 20 = $10.  And the fish food was $2.

Let's add it all up: $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.00


$33.00 

"
"Okay, so the beanstalk started at 3 inches. Then it doubled, so it was 3 times 2 which is 6 inches tall.  Then it grew 4 more inches, so it ended up being 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows with 18 seats each, that's 4 times 18 which is 72 seats total.

The administrators took up a quarter of the seats, so that's 72 divided by 4, which is 18 seats.

That leaves 72 minus 18, which is 54 seats.

The parents took up a third of the rest, so that's 54 divided by 3, which is 18 seats.

That means there were 54 minus 18, or 36 seats left for the students.


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 poles at each intersection, and each pole has 4 street lights. That means there are 6 * 4 = 24 street lights at each intersection.

Since there are 4 intersections, there are a total of 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

But, 20 of them aren't working, so there are 96 - 20 = 76 street lights working.


76 

"
"Okay, so one DVD can be played 1000 times.  The first one has been played a bunch already, 356 times. So it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times.

The second DVD has only been played 135 times, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

To find the total, we add those together: 644 + 865 = 1509


1509 

"
"Okay, so John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. Each time he went, it was for 2 hours.  That means he had 2 times 2, or 4 hours of therapy each week.

Over 6 weeks, that's 4 hours a week times 6 weeks, which is 24 hours total.

Each hour costs $125, so 24 hours times $125 an hour is $3000.


$3000 

"
"Okay, so Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 4 pieces at school because he chews one every two hours and school is 8 hours long. Then he chews one on the way home and one after dinner, so that's 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces gone.

That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.  He gives half of those to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

So Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

"
"If Charmaine is gonna be 16 in 12 years, that means she's 16 - 12 = 4 years old right now.  

So in 4 years, she'll be 4 + 4 = 8 years old.

"
"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 times $3, which is $27. The basketball coach spent 8 times $14, which is $112.  To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract: $112 - $27 = $85.


$85 

"
"Okay, so Arianna has 10 rows of flowers and each row has 20 flowers. That's 10 times 20, which is 200 flowers in total.  But only 4 out of every 5 flowers bloomed. So, we need to do 200 times 4/5. That equals 160 flowers.


160 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's internet is pretty fast!  

First, we gotta figure out how many kilobytes are in a megabyte. It's 1000, right? So her 20 kb per second is like 0.02 megabytes per second.

Then, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so we gotta multiply that 0.02 by 60 and then by 60 again.

That gives us 72 megabytes per hour!

"
"Okay, so the tow truck towed 10 cars a day for the first three days, so that's 10 x 3 = 30 cars.

Then it towed 4 fewer cars each day for the rest of the week, which is 7 days - 3 days = 4 days.

So it towed 10 - 4 = 6 cars each day for those last four days.

That's 6 x 4 = 24 cars.

In total, it towed 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week.

"
"Okay, so Adam needs to be 4 feet tall.  He's 40 inches tall now, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so he's 40/12 = 3.33 feet tall.

He needs to grow 4 - 3.33 = 0.67 feet more.

That's 0.67 * 12 = 8 inches.

He grows 2 inches every year, so it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years to grow tall enough.

"
"Okay, so James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so that's 10 times 25,000 which is $250,000.  The company had to pay for the cars first, and that was 30% of $250,000, so 0.30 times 250,000 is $75,000.

That means they made a profit of $250,000 minus $75,000, which is $175,000. James gets 10% of that, so 0.10 times $175,000 is $17,500.


$17,500
"
"Okay, so 25% of the surfers can stay up on the big wave, and that's 25 people.  Then 60% of those are girls, so that's 15 girls.  That means 10 guys can stay up.

"
"Okay, so the diamond is $2000. The gold one is 4/5 of that, so it's (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.  The silver one is $400 cheaper than the gold one, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total, we add them all up: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800


$4800
"
"Okay, so Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.

"
"Okay, so Tom needs to catch up 75 miles.  He's going 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.  That means he'll close the distance by 15 miles every hour.

So, it will take him 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours to catch up.

"
"Okay, so Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so he caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so he caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

"
"Okay, so Manny's parents will only pay for classes if they cost $10 or less each.  Since there are 10 classes, that means they'd pay a maximum of $100.  But the classes already cost $60.  That means they have $40 left over.  If each class costs $10, he could miss 4 classes and still be under budget.

"Okay, so apples cost $1.30 each and oranges cost $1.10 each.  

Five apples would cost $6.50 (5 x $1.30 = $6.50) and five oranges would cost $5.50 (5 x $1.10 = $5.50).

That means Clyde would pay $12.00 in total ($6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00).


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs to dig a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That means it's gonna be 6 times 4 times 3, which is 72 cubic feet of dirt.

If he takes 3 seconds to dig out each cubic foot, it'll take him 72 times 3 seconds to dig the whole hole.

That's 216 seconds!

"
"Okay, so the truck starts at $30,000.  The king cab is an extra $7500.  The leather seats cost $2500 because that's a third of the price of the king cab. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they are $2000. The lights are $1500.

Let's add up all the extras: $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500

Now, add that to the base price: $30000 + $13500 = $43500


$43500 

"
"Okay, so Tim's getting a raise of 5% of his $20,000 salary. That's like finding 5% of 20,000, which is $1000.

So now he makes $20,000 + $1000 = $21,000 each month.

He also gets a bonus of half his salary, so that's $20,000 / 2 = $10,000 extra!

That means he makes $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000 every month now.

In a year, he'll make $31,000 * 12 = $372,000.


$372000 

"
"Okay, so James buys a bunch of stuff for his new wardrobe. Let's see...

* The suits cost $750 each, and he buys 10, so that's 10 * $750 = $7500.
* The pants are cheaper, they cost 1/5 of the suits, so they're $750 / 5 = $150 each. He buys 10 of those too, so that's 10 * $150 = $1500.
* He gets 3 shirts for every suit, so that's 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so 30 shirts * $60/shirt = $1800.

Now, to find the total, we add up everything: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"
"Okay, so Steve is 60, and his wife is 4 years older, so she's 64. Their son is half his mom's age, which is 64 divided by 2, so he's 32.  His wife is 3 years younger than him, so she's 29.

"
"Okay, so each bag has 8 portions and each portion is 2 kilograms. That means one bag has 8 times 2 kilograms, which is 16 kilograms of flour.  If we have three bags, we multiply that by 3: 16 times 3 equals 48 kilograms.


48 

"
"Okay, so Alisa biked for a longer time and faster than Stanley.  

To find out how far Alisa biked, we multiply her speed by the time she biked: 12 miles per hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

Stanley biked for a shorter time and slower, so we do the same thing: 10 miles per hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

Finally, we add up the distances they both biked: 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.


79 

"
"Okay, so Bill digs through the soil pretty fast, 4 feet every hour.  That means the soil part will take him 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

The clay is tougher, though. He only digs half as fast, so it's 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours for the clay.

To get the total time, we add the soil time and the clay time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"
"Okay, so Howie needs cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and all 25 of his classmates. That's 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people.

"Okay, so Clara got a good deal on Tuesday! She saved $2 with her voucher, so she paid $398 for 20 pomegranates.

The next day, the price went way up to $30 each!  But they had a 10% discount, so that's $60 off.  So Sheila paid $540 for her 20 pomegranates.

That means Sheila paid $540 - $398 = $142 more than Clara.


**Answer:** 142 

"
"Okay, so Ariadne made $400 from red hats, and that was only half of what she made from green hats.  So she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

That means in the first month she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month, so she made $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

To find out how much she made in two months, we add the two months together: $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, so James gets a free hour, which means he only has to pay for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, but then each hour after that is double the price, so $15 x 2 = $30.  

So, the second hour is $30 and the third hour is also $30.  

That means he paid $15 + $30 + $30 = $75 in total.


75 

"
"Okay, so Sally started with $200 and now has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

But she should have gotten $300, so they took out $300 - $220 = $80 from her paycheck.


$80 

"
"Okay, so Lori needs enough deviled eggs for everyone at her party.  Each person wants 3 halves, and she has 16 guests, so that's 16 times 3, which is 48 halves.

Since each egg makes 2 halves, she needs 48 halves divided by 2 halves per egg, which is 24 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she needs 24 eggs divided by 12 eggs per dozen, which equals 2 dozen eggs.

"
"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000 to buy.  Then he pays $5000 a month for the hanger, and double that for fuel, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10,000 for fuel each month.

That means every month he spends $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

For a whole year, that's $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

So in total, it cost him $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000 for the first year.


$330000
"
"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so pork took 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together. That's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 is 40, so beans took 40 minutes.

To find the total time, we add up the time for each thing: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much more the first mix costs than the second mix.

The first mix has half a pound of almonds, which costs $5 (because $10 a pound times 1/2 pound is $5). It also has a third of a pound of walnuts, which costs $5 (because $15 a pound times 1/3 pound is $5). So the first mix costs $10 total.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds, which costs $2 (because $10 a pound times 1/5 pound is $2). It also has a third of a pound of walnuts, which costs $5 (same as before). So the second mix costs $7 total.

If we subtract the cost of the second mix from the first mix, we get $3 ($10 - $7 = $3).

"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese, right?  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2.  We know there are 70 legs total and 20 heads.

Let's think about it: if all the animals were sheep, there would be way more than 70 legs. So there have to be some geese.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe we can try guessing? Let's say there are 10 sheep. That's 40 legs. That leaves 30 legs for the geese, which means there would be 15 geese (30 / 2 = 15).  

But wait, 10 sheep and 15 geese is 25 animals, not 20!

Let's try fewer sheep. How about 15 sheep? That's 60 legs. That leaves 10 legs for the geese, which means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

15 sheep and 5 geese is 20 animals, and that's right!

So the answer is 15.

"
"Okay, so Roger's coffee usually costs $5 a pound. But since his favorite was gone, he had to get the more expensive one. That one costs 20% more, so it's $5 plus 20% of $5, which is $1. So the fancy coffee is $6 a pound.

He needs a pound a day for a week, which is 7 days, so that's 7 pounds of coffee.  That's 7 times $6, which is $42.

Oh, and he got a donut for $2. So the total is $42 plus $2, which is $44.


$44 

"
"Okay, so Gus spent $20.00 total.  The chips cost $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  If you add those up, that's $13.00.  

So the apple pie must have cost $7.00 because $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so James delivers a bunch of newspapers.  He does 198 for District A and 209 for District C. That's 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers.

If he delivers 600 total, then he must deliver 600 - 407 = 193 to District B.


193

"Okay, so John's class is 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours a week.

"Okay, so there are 150 teachers, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means 150 x 0.60 = 90 teachers teach history.

That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

If each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours, then all the math teachers sleep a total of 60 x 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $150.

If they put all their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

If they split that evenly, each person would get $360 / 3 = $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so the game is normally 4 quarters long, and each quarter is 12 minutes. That's 4 times 12, which is 48 minutes. But they played 5 extra minutes because it was a tie. So, the whole game was 48 plus 5, which is 53 minutes long.


53 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the 50 employees are managers, which is 50 times 0.20, that's 10 managers.  Then, 30% of those managers oversee the whole company, so that's 10 times 0.30, which equals 3.

"
"Okay, so Svetlana needs 8.25 tablespoons of stuff for each muffin.  If she's making 16 muffins, we gotta multiply: 8.25 x 16 = 132 tablespoons.


132 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy total.  If they split it evenly, each person gets 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy.


4 

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies that cost 50 cents each, so that's 7 times 50 cents, which is $3.50.  He also got 10 candies that cost 75 cents each, so that's 10 times 75 cents, which is $7.50.  

In total, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.

If he paid with $15, his change is $15 - $11 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days total. She had 8 good days at the start, then 1 more good day, and then another good day. That's 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days already.

So she has 12 - 10 = 2 good days left. 


2
"
"Let 'x' be the number of books Sally has. Janey has twice that amount plus 3 more, so Janey has 2x + 3 books. We know Janey has 21 books, so 2x + 3 = 21.  

If we subtract 3 from both sides, we get 2x = 18. Then, dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 9.

"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches every day.  It's already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  We want to know how many days it takes to get to 600 inches.

First, we need to see how much more it needs to grow: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Then, we divide that by how much it grows each day: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.


12 

"
"Okay, so James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then 8 more dogs show up, so he needs 8 more toys. That's 12 toys total.

But then, there are twice as many dogs! That's 8 times 2, which is 16 more dogs. So now he needs 16 more toys, making it 28 toys.

Uh oh, 3 dogs left, so he doesn't need those toys anymore. 28 minus 3 is 25.


25 

"
"Okay, so they put in $1200 total. Dylan put in 2/5 of that, which is like saying he put in (2/5) * $1200 = $480.

That leaves $1200 - $480 = $720 left.

Frances put in 2/3 of what was left, so she put in (2/3) * $720 = $480.

That means Skyler put in the rest, which is $1200 - $480 - $480 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Carol and Jennifer have 64 signatures already. They want to get to 100.  

That means they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures.


36 

"
"Karen makes double what Lorie makes, so she earns $10 * 2 = $20 per hour.

If she works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 * 3 = $60 each day.

Over two days, she'd make $60 * 2 = $120.


120 

"
"Okay, so if 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 divided by 6 is 6).  If you have 96 potatoes, you can make a whole bunch of hash browns!  You'd multiply 96 by 6, which is 576.


576 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 adults plus Jack, that's 9 people in total.  If each adult weighs 80 kg, then they all weigh 9 * 80 = 720 kg.  The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they're going over by 720 - 700 = 20 kg.


20 

"
"Okay, so Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more than her, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. The Cookie Monster has 12 less than Max, so he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer has 23 more than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up all the cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.


298 

"
"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer by half its original size, which is like adding 50% more. Then she added 20cm of lace.  If the dress is 140cm long now, we need to figure out how long it was before.

Let's think about it like this:

* If 140cm is the dress with the extra length and lace, we need to take away the 20cm of lace first. That leaves us with 120cm.
* Since the 120cm is 150% of the original length (100% + 50%), we need to figure out what 100% is.
* To do that, we divide 120cm by 1.50 (which is the same as 150%).

120cm / 1.50 = 80cm


**Answer: 80** 

"
"Okay, so Chris mows his whole lawn in an hour on turtle mode, which is 60 minutes.  If he does half in turtle mode, that's 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.

He mows the other half in rabbit mode, which takes 40 minutes total, so half is 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

To find the total time, we add those together: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Okay, so they already walked for 6 minutes plus 13 minutes, which is 19 minutes total.  They have 30 minutes to get to school, so they have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left.


11 

"
"Okay, so Catherine buys apples for $4. Bananas are $2 a kilo, and she gets 2 kilos, so that's $4. Oranges are $3 a kilo, and she gets 2 kilos, so that's $6.  

Let's add it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14


14 

"
"Okay, so Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, who made 30. That means Celinda baked 30 x 2 = 60 cookies.  

Together they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

They ate 10, so they put 90 - 10 = 80 cookies in the box.


80 

"
"Okay, so there are two twins and three triplets. One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years, and all together they are 44 years old.  To figure out how old one of the twins is, we gotta do some thinking!

Let's say the triplets are all 'r' years old. That means one twin is 'r + 7' years old. Since there are two twins, their total age is 2 * (r + 7). The triplets' total age is 3 * r.

All together, their ages add up to 44, so: 2 * (r + 7) + 3 * r = 44

Let's solve for 'r':

2r + 14 + 3r = 44
5r + 14 = 44
5r = 30
r = 6

So each triplet is 6 years old.  

One twin is 7 years older than a triplet, so that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.


13
"
"Okay, so John has 3 hours before dinner, which is 3 times 60 minutes, so that's 180 minutes.  He has 20 minutes of math, 40 minutes of reading, and 20 minutes of history, so that's 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes of homework.

If he takes away his homework time from the time before dinner, he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes for a nap!


100 

"
"Okay, so Manolo buys 5 lollipops for 40 cents each, that's 5 times 40 cents, which is $2.00.  That means the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

If each candy costs $1.20 divided by 4, that's 30 cents per candy.

Ten lollipops would cost 10 times 40 cents, which is $4.00. Ten candies would cost 10 times 30 cents, which is $3.00.

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins each month. Neil saves 2/5 more than that, which is like 20 x (2/5) = 8 more coins.

So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

In ten years, Rong saves 20 x 12 x 10 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 x 12 x 10 = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Okay, so the vaccines cost $20 each, and he needs two, so that's $20 x 2 = $40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the whole bill, and we don't know the whole bill yet.  But we know the heartworm check is $24 because 60% of something is the same as multiplying by 0.60.

So, the total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

If he brought $125, he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left. 


$61
"
"Okay, so they have 5 bananas, and each banana costs $1.00, so that's 5 times $1.00 which is $5.00.

Then there are 12 apples at $0.50 each, so that's 12 times $0.50 which is $6.00.

The oranges are the priciest at $3.00 each, and they have 7, so that's 7 times $3.00 which is $21.00.

Now we add it all up: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


$32.00
"
"Okay, so Brittany has a bunch of squares on her comforter.  Let's see... she has 14 red ones. Then she has 4 more blue ones than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

She has 6 more green squares than blue, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

And she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

To find out how big the comforter is, we add up all the squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet. 


68
"
"Okay, so Mia has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, which is 8 x 5 = 40 regular chairs.  That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

But she needs enough chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies, so that's 42 + 15 = 57 people.

She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so half of the deer are bucks, which is 50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks.

Then, 20% of those bucks have 8 points, so that's 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks.


5 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

Betty got 30% more points than Adam, who has 50. That means Betty got 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta did really well! She got 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they still need 400 - 255 = 145 more points.


145 

"
"Okay, so Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids, and each of them had 3 kids. That means she has 3 times 3, which is 9 grandkids.  Then each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so that's 9 times 3, which equals 27 great-grandbabies.


27 

"
"Okay, so Greta makes $2400.  She saves half of that for retirement, which is $1200. Then she spends $480 on her car.  If you add those together, that's $1680.  

If she started with $2400 and spent $1680, she has $720 left.


$720.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 spots for pencils, but 4 are missing. That means there are 16 pencils left.  Since pencils come in pairs, we divide the number of pencils by 2: 16 / 2 = 8 pairs.


8 

"
"Okay, so the city is setting off a lot of fireworks!  They have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each, so that's 15 times 20 which equals 300 fireworks. Hannah can see 40% of those, so that's 300 times 0.40 which is 120 fireworks.

Hannah also sets off her own fireworks, 3 boxes with 5 in each, so that's 3 times 5 which equals 15 fireworks.

In total, Hannah sees 120 plus 15 fireworks, which is 135 fireworks!


135 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 people going to the movies.  Each person gets 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 drinks and 20 x 3 = 60 snacks.

That's a total of 40 + 60 = 100 drinks and snacks.

Since each one costs $2, they spent 100 x $2 = $200 on snacks and drinks.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Gissela's truck can carry 4000 pounds. Gordy's truck is bigger, it can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.

Together, Gissela and Gordy can carry 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.

If all three trucks together can carry 11600 pounds, then Gary's truck must carry 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


2800
"
"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls. The girls each ate 3 dumplings. The guys ate 1 more than the girls, so they ate 4 dumplings each.

Let's see... 8 guys times 4 dumplings each is 32 dumplings.  The girls ate 6 girls times 3 dumplings each, which is 18 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings!


50 

"
"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100.  Gerald got 3 parts and Julia got 2 parts, which means they split it into 5 parts total. Each part is worth $20 because 100 divided by 5 is 20. Gerald got 3 parts, so he had $60. Then he spent $10 on a book, so he has $50 left.


50 

"
"Okay, so the cat is super fast, running 15 feet every second! The turtle is way slower, like 5 times slower.  That means the turtle only goes 3 feet every second (15 / 5 = 3).

If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it'll cover 120 feet (3 x 40 = 120).


120 

"
"Okay, so they need to raise $4200 more.  If they raise $700 each hour, it will take them 6 hours to get to their goal.


6 

"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses a bunch of water from the river, right?  They use 40% of it. And then, most of that water, like 80%, goes to factories and stuff.  That means the rest, 20%, is for other things, like homes and parks.

So, if they use 40% of the river water, and only 20% of that is for non-factory stuff, then they use 8% of the whole river's water for everything else.


8 

"
"Okay, so Alex makes $12 each day tutoring.  There are 7 days in a week, so she makes $12 x 7 = $84 each week. For two weeks, she'd make $84 x 2 = $168.


168 

"
"Okay, so they make 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream every 2 hours. That means they make 50 quarts each hour.  They make vanilla slower, 50 quarts every 4 hours, so that's 12.5 quarts each hour.

Together, they make 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 quarts every hour.

If they work for 48 hours straight, they'd make 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts!


3000 

"
"Okay, so Marcus bought a bunch of stuff: 5 croissants for $3 each, 4 cinnamon rolls for $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4 each, and 13 blueberry muffins for $1 each.

First, let's figure out how much each type of thing costs:

* Croissants: 5 * $3 = $15
* Cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10
* Mini quiches: 3 * $4 = $12
* Blueberry muffins: 13 * $1 = $13

Now, let's add all that up: $15 + $10 + $12 + $13 = $50.

But wait! He has a loyalty card for 10% off.  So we need to take 10% of $50: $50 * 0.10 = $5.

Finally, subtract the discount from the total: $50 - $5 = $45.


$45.00 

"
"Okay, so the ice cream is $1.50 per scoop, and if you buy two you get one free. That means every three scoops cost $3.00 (2 scoops * $1.50 = $3.00).  Erin has $6.00, so she could buy two sets of three scoops, which is six scoops total. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Ginger eats 4 candies a day for 14 days, that's 4 times 14 which is 56 candies. Amy eats 3 candies a day for 14 days, so that's 3 times 14 which is 42 candies.

Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 candies left.

Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 candies left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more candies than Ginger.


14 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden wants to tile two-thirds of his bathroom. That's like cutting the bathroom into three parts and using tiles for two of them.

His bathroom is 36 square feet, so two-thirds of that is 36 divided by 3, which is 12, and then times 2, so 12 times 2 is 24 square feet.

He needs 24 tiles for every square foot, so for 24 square feet, he'll need 24 times 24, which is 576 tiles.


576 

"
"Okay, so James paid $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. He got 30 pounds, so that's 30 x $1.50 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

So in total, he spent $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 x $2.50 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own.


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each, but the price went up by 10%.  

First, we gotta figure out how much the price went up: 10% of $700 is $70 (cause 10% is like 10 out of every 100, so we do 10/100 times $700).

So now each computer costs $700 + $70 = $770.

To find the total cost, we multiply the new price by the number of computers: $770 * 500 = $385,000.


$385,000 

"
"Okay, so he used 6 eggs and each egg has 75 calories, so that's 6 times 75 which is 450 calories.  The cheese and ham are each 2 ounces. Cheese has 120 calories per ounce, so that's 2 times 120, which is 240 calories. The ham is 40 calories per ounce, so 2 times 40 is 80 calories.  

Now we add it all up: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.


770 

"
"Okay, so pencils are 50 cents each, and erasers are 25 cents.  You bought 6 pencils, so that's 6 times 50 cents, which is $3.00. Then you got 8 erasers, so that's 8 times 25 cents, which is $2.00.  

In total, you spent $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00.

If you paid with a $10 bill, your change would be $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the 100 people get interviews, which is 30 people. Then 20% of those 30 people get job offers, so that's 6 people.  Finally, one-third of those 6 people take the job, which is 2 people.


2 

"
"Okay, so Goldy gave away 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks of rice.

Since each sack has 25 kilograms, she gave away a total of 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms of rice.


175 

"
"Castle bought 8 boxes this week (3 + 5 = 8).  She bought 4 boxes last week. So she bought 4 more boxes this week (8 - 4 = 4).


4 

"
"Okay, so Helga's a super fast dancer!  

Let's see... she taps her feet really fast when her arms are down, 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, so that's 550 taps every minute! She does that for 3 minutes, so that's 550 times 3 which is 1650 taps.

When she puts her arms up, she slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot, so that's 400 taps a minute total. She does that for 2 minutes, so that's 400 times 2 which is 800 taps.

To find the total, we add the taps from both parts: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps!


2450 

"
"Okay, so Ron doesn't want his car to get messed up, right?  Fixing the pothole himself costs him $120 for the fine plus $75 for the asphalt stuff. That's a total of $195.

If he doesn't fix it, it'll cost him $450 to fix his car later.

So, he saves $450 - $195 = $255 by fixing it himself.


$255 

"
"Okay, so they started with 170 regular chairs and 23 baby chairs. That's a total of 193 chairs.  Then they took away 20 regular chairs and 13 baby chairs, so they took away 33 chairs in all.  

If they started with 193 and took away 33, they have 160 chairs left.


160 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 pizzas with 12 slices each, that's 60 slices total. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so they ate 2/3 * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices. The other two friends ate 3/4 * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.  

That means they ate a total of 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

So, there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left.


18 

"
"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. The dog is faster and eats them in 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  

To find the average, we add the times together: 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Then we divide that by 2 because we have two animals: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.


25 

"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's like 96 inches plus 4 inches, so it's 100 inches long!

The problem says his shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So if we take away 10 inches from Topher's shoe size, we get 90 inches.

That 90 inches is 9 times the size of Bobby's shoe.  If we divide 90 inches by 9, we find out Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so Hannah breaks a bunch of car windows.  Let's see... she breaks windows on a quarter of the student cars, and there are 64 student cars. So that's 64 divided by 4, which is 16 cars. Each of those cars has 4 windows, so that's 16 times 4, which is 64 windows.

Then she breaks windows on three-quarters of the teacher cars. There are 32 teacher cars, so that's 32 times 3 divided by 4, which is 24 cars. Each teacher car has 2 windows, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 windows.

Finally, we add up the windows she broke on student cars and teacher cars: 64 plus 48 is 112 windows.


112 

"
"Okay, so Candy has a bunch of thread.  Let's see... 15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools.  She has 150 spools in total.  To find the percentage, we do (60 / 150) * 100. That equals 40%!


40 

"
"Okay, so 2/5 of the people voted by midday, which is 2000 people. That means 3000 people were left. Then, 2/3 of those people voted by 4 pm, so that's another 2000 people.  That leaves 1000 people who didn't vote yet.


1000 

"
"Okay, so Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day, and he wants it to last for 30 days.  That means he needs 4 x 30 = 120 pieces of gum.

Each pack has 15 pieces, so he'll need 120 / 15 = 8 packs of gum.


8 

"
"Okay, so they need enough graham crackers for 18 kid smores plus 6 adult smores, which is 24 smores total.  Each sleeve makes 8 smores, so they need 3 sleeves. Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they only need 1 box of graham crackers.

1 

"
"Okay, so Dora is 15. Her dad is twice her age plus 8 more years, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is 4 years younger than her dad, so she's 38 - 4 = 34 years old.

To find their total age, we add them all up: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old.

"
"Okay, so Cindy has two books that weigh 2 pounds each, so those are 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. Her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. Her history book is double her English book, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.  

To find the total, we add up all the weights: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.


17 

"
"Okay, so Candidate A got 20 votes out of 100. Candidate B got 50% more than that, so they got 20 + (20 * 0.50) = 30 votes.  That means Candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.


50 

"
"Okay, so Beck starts with 100 - 23 = 77 apples. Then Boris gives him 10 more, so Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples left.  That means Boris has 90 - 87 = 3 more apples than Beck.


3 

"
"Okay, so Peter uses 12 ounces for the big cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes.  That's 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces total.

If he started with 32 ounces, he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left. 


2
"
"Okay, so Clara has 20 books and that's twice the number Steven has.  That means Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.


4 

"
"Okay, so a gallon of milk costs $5, and a half-gallon costs $3.  If she buys 10 gallons, that's 10 * $5 = $50.  And for the half-gallons, it's 16 * $3 = $48.  

So, in total, she spent $50 + $48 = $98.


98 

"
"Okay, so 10 kids like to bake, 5 like basketball, and 10 like music (because that's double the basketball players).  That's 10 + 5 + 10 = 25 kids.

If there are 50 kids in total, then 50 - 25 = 25 kids like video games.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy started with 12 birds. Then, he scared away 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds. That means there were 12 minus 4, or 8 birds left. Then, 20 more birds came, so there are 8 plus 20, which equals 28 birds in the backyard.


28 

"
"Okay, so there are 80 students in total, and they're split into two classes, so each class has 40 students.  If 40% are girls, that means 60% are boys.  

To find out how many boys are in each class, we do 40 students * 60% = 24 boys.


24 

"
"Okay, so Mara starts with 2 slices, then adds 3 more, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 slices.  Then she triples them, so she has 5 x 3 = 15 slices. She eats 2, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices. But then her friend takes 5, so there are 13 - 5 = 8 slices left.


8 

"
"Okay, so Melissa has to groom a bunch of animals this week. Let's see... she's got 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. That's a lot!  

That's 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals total.

Since there are 7 days in a week, she'll groom 28 / 7 = 4 animals each day.


4 

"
"Okay, so Mark spent $1800 times 3 on the packs, which is $5400.  He got two really good cards worth $4000 and $1000, so that's $5000 right there. Then he got 30 more cards worth $50 each, so those are worth $1500.  

If you add up all the good cards, they're worth $6500.  If you take away the money he spent, $6500 - $5400, he made $1100 profit.


$1100 

"
"Okay, so Jake's family has 2 adults and 2 kids.  

The first park costs $26 per adult, so that's 2 * $26 = $52.  

Kids are $12 each, so that's 2 * $12 = $24.

The first park would cost $52 + $24 = $76 total.

The second park is $14 per adult, so that's 2 * $14 = $28.

Kids are $10 each, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.

The second park would cost $28 + $20 = $48 total.

If they go to the second park, they'll save $76 - $48 = $28.


$28
"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 on each tomato.  Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, that's 500 * $0.10 = $50 saved every day.

If he saves $50 a day, then in a week he saves $50 * 7 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, so Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 x 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the amount Sean has, so Carl has 56 x 4 = 224 marbles.  To find the total, we add up Cal's and Carl's marbles: 112 + 224 = 336 marbles.


336 

"
"Okay, so they have 54 students and want to split them into groups of 9.  That's 54 divided by 9, which is 6 groups.  But they need 12 groups total.  So they need 12 minus 6, which is 6 more groups.


6 

"
"Okay, so Candy rents out chairs. On weekdays she rents 60 a day, and that's 5 days a week, so that's 60 times 5 which is 300 chairs. On the weekend she rents 100 chairs a day, and there are 2 weekend days, so that's 100 times 2 which is 200 chairs.  

That means she rents out 300 plus 200, which is 500 chairs every week.

In a month, there are 4 weeks, so she rents 500 times 4 which is 2000 chairs each month.

If she does this for two months, she'll rent out 2000 times 2 which is 4000 chairs.


4000 

"
"Okay, so Gunther starts with 48 bananas.  That sneaky Arnold takes half, which is 24 bananas.  So Gunther has 24 left. Then he gets 25 more, so now he has 49.  But Arnold takes 12 more, leaving Gunther with 37.  Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, giving him a total of 43 bananas.


**Answer:** 43 

"
"Okay, so the bill is $100 each month, and there are 4 roommates.  That means each roommate pays $100 / 4 = $25 each month.

To find out how much they pay each year, we multiply that by 12 months: $25/month * 12 months = $300 per year.


$300 

"
"Okay, so Jeff had 8 groups of 12 glasses, which is 96 glasses. He also had 4 groups of 12 plates, so that's 48 plates.  

Then some stuff broke - 10 glasses and 6 plates.  

So, he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left.

And he has 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

That means he has 86 + 42 = 128 glasses and plates all together now. 


128 

"
"Okay, so Lorraine has a bunch of stickers and wants buttons.  

* She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them, which is 27 stickers. Since each small sticker gets her one button, she gets 27 buttons. She can also trade those 27 buttons for 9 big buttons (27 divided by 3).

* She has 40 big stickers and trades half of them, which is 20. Each big sticker is worth one big button, so she gets 20 more buttons.

* She has 20 big stickers left and trades them for small buttons. Each big sticker gets her 3 small buttons, so she gets 60 small buttons.

*  Let's add up all her buttons: 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons!



**Answer:** 107
"
"Okay, so Joey played 2 games on Monday and then 4 on Saturday because that's double the Monday games.  He also played 1 game on Friday.  

Let's add them up: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7

He played 7 games in one week. 

7 

"
"Okay, so there were 33 people voting, and twice as many voted ""yes"" as ""no"".  

That means if we split the council into 3 groups, one group voted ""no"" and two groups voted ""yes"".

Since 33 divided by 3 is 11, there must have been 11 votes against the new rule.

That means 2 times 11, or 22 people, voted for it!


22 

"
"Okay, so Krissa has a lot of kids to buy shirts for!

* She needs 11 extra-small shirts.
* Twice that many need small, so that's 11 x 2 = 22 small shirts.
* Four less kids need medium than small, so that's 22 - 4 = 18 medium shirts.
* Half as many need large as medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 large shirts.
* And 6 more kids need extra-large than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 extra-large shirts.

To find the total, we add them all up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts


75 

"
"Okay, so the bag is 5% off, which means we need to figure out what 5% of $140 is.  

To do that, I can multiply 140 by 0.05 (because 5% is the same as 0.05). That gives me $7.

So the discount is $7.  

Now we subtract that from the original price: $140 - $7 = $133


$133 

"
"Wow, that's a lot of songs!  

Okay, so he has 20 playlists with 300 songs each, so that's 20 * 300 = 6000 songs total.

And each song is 10 hours long, so 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours of music!


60000 

"
"Okay, so 20 out of 50 people like horse #2. That leaves 30 people.  Then 60% of those 30 people like horse #7, so that's 18 people.  That means 12 people must like horse #12.


12 

"
"Okay, so one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 girl Pomeranians. That means there are 6 x 3 = 18 Pomeranians in total.

Since the Pomeranians are two-thirds of all the puppies, Jana has 18 x 3 / 2 = 27 puppies.


27 

"
"Okay, so Jayden has $70 and his sister gives him $45. That means he has $70 + $45 = $115.  The camera costs $200, so he needs $200 - $115 = $85 more.


$85 

"
"Okay, so they need 250 cases of shingles total. The second house needs more than the first, and the third house needs double the first.  

Let's say the first house needs 50 cases. That means the second house needs double that, or 100 cases. The third house needs double the first house, so that's another 100 cases.

50 + 100 + 100 = 250!  

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles. 

100 

"
"Okay, so Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6.  Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5. And Chase spent $3 on lettuce.  

If you add those up, they spent a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $14 on salad stuff.


14 

"
"Okay, so George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than that.  

To find out how many more pears he has, I can multiply the number of bananas by 45% which is the same as 0.45.

200 bananas * 0.45 = 90 pears

So he has 90 more pears than bananas.

That means he has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears.

In total, he has 290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits.


490 

"
"Marissa had $60 left after buying the ball. Since each candy bar costs $5, she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars.


12 

"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for every liter of juice.  If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 5 times 4, which is 20 kilograms of oranges.

Each kilogram costs $3, so 20 kilograms will cost 20 times 3, which is $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Ezra read 300 books, and that's twice as many as Ahmed.  That means Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra read 150 more books, so now he's read 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Together they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.


600 

"
"Okay, so Tanya gets paid $15 for each hour she teaches.

On Monday, she taught for 5 hours and got a $5 bonus because she taught more than 3 classes. So that's 5 hours * $15/hour = $75, plus the $5 bonus, for a total of $80.

On Wednesday, she taught for 2 hours, so she made 2 hours * $15/hour = $30.

To find out how much she made in total, we add up Monday's earnings and Wednesday's earnings: $80 + $30 = $110.


110 

"
"They sold 20 vanilla scents (4 scents * 5 sales each) and 16 fruity scents (8 scents * 2 sales each).  That means they sold 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.

"
"Okay, so Bennet makes $60 from selling his eggplants.  That means he needs to make another $75 from the corn.  If he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each one for $3 to make that much money. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, that's 7 + 5 = 12 hours total.

She reads for 3 hours, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.

She spends 1/3 of that time on video games, which is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

That means she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To find out what percentage that is, we do (6 / 12) * 100% = 50%.


50 

"
"Anthony gave away a bunch of pencils! First, he gave Brandon half of his 50 pencils, which is 25 pencils.  That left him with 25 pencils. Then he gave Charlie 3/5 of those, which is 15 pencils. So Anthony kept 25 - 15 = 10 pencils.


10
"
"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, that's 300 miles total.

Since he drives 75 miles per hour, it takes him 4 hours to get there and 4 hours to get back (300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours).

He also spends 6 hours at the museum, so in total, he's gone for 10 hours (4 hours + 6 hours + 4 hours).


10 

"
"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for his toys.  He's making 57 cars and each car needs 4 wheels, so that's 57 times 4 which is 228 wheels. Then he's making 73 motorcycles and each one needs 2 wheels, so that's 73 times 2 which is 146 wheels.  

In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

He has 650 wheels, so he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.


276 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $1000, and you get 20% off.  That means you save 20/100 * $1000 = $200.

So you have to pay $1000 - $200 = $800.


$800 

"
"Okay, so Mike has a lot of movies!  

First, let's figure out how many movies are in a series: 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.

Those series movies are cheaper, so they cost 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in a series.

Of those, 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies are older and cost $5 each, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies are newer, so that's 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67



$3866.67
"
"Okay, so Winston got 6 pounds of peaches at $2 a pound, so that's 6 times 2 which is $12.  Then he got 8 pounds of plums at $1 a pound, so that's 8 times 1 which is $8.  And lastly, he got 6 pounds of apricots at $3 a pound, so that's 6 times 3 which is $18.  

To find out how much he spent in total, we add up the cost of each fruit: $12 + $8 + $18 = $38.00


38.00 

"
"Okay, so they drove for 4.5 hours and went 50 miles each hour, so they drove 4.5 times 50 which is 225 miles. Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles an hour, so they hiked 1.5 times 20 which is 30 miles.  To find the total distance, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance: 225 + 30 = 255 miles.


255 

"
"This is a tricky one!  

We know Ava does better in some ways, but worse in others.  To figure out who wins, we'd need to know how many enemies Emma jumps on, how many berries she gets, and how much time she has left.  

Let's say Emma jumps on 5 enemies and gets 2 berries, and has 10 seconds left on the timer. We could figure out her score, then see how Ava does with those extra enemies and berries, but less time.  

It's like a puzzle! 

"
"Okay, so they spent $30 on two pizzas, which means the other two pizzas cost $64 - $30 = $34.

Since the other two pizzas cost the same, each one costs $34 / 2 = $17.


$17 

"
"Okay, so they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 times.

Then on the other two days, they ride twice as much, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 times each day.

For those two days, they ride a total of 6 * 2 = 12 times.

Adding it all up, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times in a week.


27 

"
"Okay, so Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He buys some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he has 4 + w white fish total.

The orange fish he has are 3 plus however many weren't white (17 - w). So he has 3 + (17 - w) orange fish.

We know the orange fish are double the white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2 * (4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4


He bought 4 white fish. 

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home every day. That's 10 miles a day.

He does that 5 days a week, so that's 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles a week.

His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so he uses 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas each week.

Gas costs $3 a gallon, so he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 on gas every week.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Carrie got ten $20 bills, which is $200. She also got 140 quarters, and each quarter is $0.25, so that's 140 * $0.25 = $35.

She spent 3/5 of the twenties, so that's (3/5) * $200 = $120.

In total, she spent $120 + $35 = $155 on lunch.


$155 

"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes. That's 5 times 22, which is 110 tomatoes.  He also has 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants. So that's 8 times 4, which is 32 eggplants.  To find the total, we add the tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.


142 

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs in total.  A quarter of them were smart TVs, which is 40 / 4 = 10 TVs. Then 1/8 were analog, so that's 40 / 8 = 5 TVs.  

That means he sold 10 + 5 = 15 TVs that weren't OLED.

So, he sold 40 - 15 = 25 OLED TVs.


25 

"
"Okay, so the school is paying for half the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.  That means John still needs $300 - $150 = $150. Since he already has $50, he's still missing $150 - $50 = $100.


$100 

"
"Okay, so it's 45 degrees during the day but way colder at night.  It's 33 degrees colder, so that means it's 12 degrees at night (45 - 33 = 12).

Uh oh, that's too cold! The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees.  

Each log warms things up by 5 degrees, so Carson needs to burn enough logs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20).

He needs to burn 4 logs because 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.


4 

"
"Okay, so they had 90 people and put them in groups of 9, so that's 10 groups.  Then 3 out of every 5 groups brought back seashells, so that's 6 groups. Each person in those groups brought back 2 seashells, and there are 9 people in each group. So that's 6 groups * 9 people * 2 seashells = 108 seashells!


108 

"
"Okay, so there were 172 people on the train. Then 47 got off, and 13 got on, so now there are 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 people. Then 38 more get off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people left on the train.


100 

"
"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each one is worth 25 cents.  That means he makes 10 times 25 cents, which is $2.50 each day.

If he does that for a whole month of 30 days, he'd make $2.50 times 30, which is $75.00.


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 each hour for her regular work.  That means for 8 hours she makes $20 x 8 = $160.

She worked 3 extra hours, and those hours pay more.  It's 150% of her regular pay, so that's $20 x 1.50 = $30 per hour for overtime.

For those 3 overtime hours, she made $30 x 3 = $90.

So, in total, she made $160 + $90 = $250 that day.


$250
"
"Okay, so there are 12 girl lions.  There are half as many boy lions, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 boy lions.  

Then there are 14 baby lions.  

To find the total, we add them all up: 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions.


32 

"
"Okay, so the jeans are 25% off, and they were originally $40.  That means the discount is $40 times 0.25, which is $10.  So the jeans cost $30 now. If Mike pays with a $50 bill, he'll get $20 back.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so they start with 200 people. Then they add 20 more each month for three months, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 new people.

That means they have 200 + 60 = 260 people working there.

If each person makes $4000, then they pay out 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000 in total.


1040000 

"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" two times, and that song is 150 seconds long each time.  That's 150 x 2 = 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" which is 240 seconds.  So all together it's 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy gets paid $11.50 an hour now. Sally makes $10.50 an hour. If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $11.50 x 20 = $230. Sally makes $10.50 x 20 = $210.  That means Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.


$20 

"
"Okay, so 3 loaves of bread would cost 3 times $2, which is $6. Two bagels would cost 2 times $1, which is $2.  That means 3 loaves cost $4 more than 2 bagels.


$4 

"
"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score.  

Half of Pierson's score is 278 divided by 2, which is 139.

Then we add 11 to that: 139 + 11 = 150. So Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score: 278 + 150 = 428


428 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 kids in each, so that's 40 times 25 which is 1000 kids.  Each kid plants one tree, so that's 1000 trees. Then there are 3 teachers per class, so that's 40 times 3 which is 120 teachers. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that's 120 times 2 which is 240 trees.  

So in total, they plant 1000 plus 240 trees, which is 1240 trees!


1240 

"
"Okay, so Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals.

If she wants goats to be 30% of her collection, she needs to figure out 30% of 14.  

30% is like 30 out of every 100, so we can do (30/100) * 14 = 4.2

Since you can't buy parts of a stuffed animal, she needs to buy 5 goats. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Kris wants to play for 30 hours total.

She plays for half an hour each day for two weeks, that's 14 days. So that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then she plays for 2 hours a day for a whole week, which is 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

In total, she's played 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours.

"
"Okay, so the faster car is going 10 miles per hour faster than the slower one.  That means every hour it pulls ahead by 10 miles.  After two hours, it will be 20 miles ahead.

"
"Okay, so the diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so that's $600 + $300 = $900 in total.

But there's also a 30% extra charge to make the ring.  That means 30% of $900 is $900 * 0.30 = $270.

So, the total cost is $900 + $270 = $1170.


$1170
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many kids passed overall.

Third grade: 340 out of 500 passed.

Fourth grade: 40 out of 100 passed.

Fifth grade:  They passed twice as much as fourth grade, so that's 40% times 2, which is 80%.  So 400 kids times 80% is 320 kids.

Now let's add up all the kids who passed: 340 + 40 + 320 = 700

There are 1000 kids total (500 + 100 + 400).

So, 700 out of 1000 passed, which is 70%.

"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips for every inch of his mosaic, and his mosaic is going to be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. He has two bags of chips, which is 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  So, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"
"Okay, so they had 10 quarts left.  

First, the four students drank 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.

Then the other students drank 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

So they drank a total of 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

That means they started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they had 48 / 4 = 12 gallons at the beginning.

"
"Dale started with 100 candies and got 100 more, so he has 100 + 100 = 200 candies. He already sold 150, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 left to sell.


50 

"
"Okay, so the school starts with 10 students.  Each month, they double. So after one month, there are 20, then 40, then 80, then 160, and finally 320 by the end of May.

If you take away the starting 10, that means 310 more students joined.


310 

"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 and each branch costs 25 cents.  To find out how many branches he climbed, we gotta divide the total money by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

If he worked 5 days, we divide the total branches by the number of days: 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.


84 

"
"Okay, so Rose picks a bunch of flowers, right? Let's see...

* She starts with 3 flowers that have 5 petals each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
* Then she gets 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so that's 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
* Next, she adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
* Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so that's 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

That's a lot of petals!  Let's add them all up: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But wait, she drops one of each kind of flower.  So that's 5 petals gone.

So, she has 101 - 5 = 96 petals in the vase.


96 

"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows. They used 9 for John's s'mores and 9 for DeSean's, that's 18 marshmallows gone. Then they dropped 3 more.  So, they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 s'mores.


7 

"
"Okay, so Jack plays for 20 minutes with one quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get half that time, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter. His other friend is better and gets to play for 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters.

His worse friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00


$17.00 

"
"Okay, so Tanya uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Let's say she uses 1 ounce of zest. That means she also uses 1 ounce of fragrance. Since she uses twice as much salt as zest, she uses 2 ounces of salt. That means she also uses 2 ounces of sugar.

Because she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses 4 ounces of oil.

If you add all that up (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2) it equals 10 ounces, which is the size of her jar.



**Answer:** 4 

"
"Okay, so John bought 3 goats and each goat cost $500.  That's 3 times 500, which is $1500. He also got 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 times 1500, which is $3000.  To find out how much he spent total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.


$4500 

"
"Okay, so Paul needs 63 cupcakes total. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones.  That means he has 48 cupcakes already (8 + 40 = 48).  

To find out how many more he needs, we subtract: 63 - 48 = 15

He needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 


15
"
"Okay, so Joe has double the cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is like 20/100 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so he gives her 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, he got rid of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That means he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.


16 

"
"Okay, so the charity got $175,000 total.  They got $50,000 from other places, so the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

If 20 students raised that much, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.


$6,250 

"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.  The second day she walked half that time, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 cars at first, then 20 more came, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 cars.  But then half of them left, so 70 / 2 = 35 cars left. That means there were 35 cars left at lunch.


35 

"
"Okay, so John does a lot of work!  

He does 30 sets of tasks each day, and each set has 5 tasks. If each task pays him $1.20, let's figure out how much he makes in a day:

*  He does 30 sets * 5 tasks/set = 150 tasks a day
* He earns $1.20/task * 150 tasks = $180.00 a day

Now, for a whole week (7 days), he makes:

* $180.00/day * 7 days = $1260.00


$1260.00 

"
"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, so she got 4 points.  

To find Sasha's total points, we add up her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18


18 

"
"Okay, so Kimberly has a lot of pets! Let's see... she has 8 packs of cat food and each one has 11 cans, so that's 8 times 11 which is 88 cans of cat food.  She has 6 packs of dog food with 6 cans each, so that's 6 times 6 which equals 36 cans of dog food.  To find the difference, we do 88 minus 36, which is 52.


52 

"
"Okay, so PJ has some cards, let's call it 'x'. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

If we add up all their cards, it should equal 341. So, x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: 7x + 12 = 341
* Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3 times that plus 12, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.


153
"
"Okay, so Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice that many blue eggs, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Then she had 1/3 as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which is 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

To find the total, we add them all up: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.


27 

"
"Okay, so Milly has to pay to ship the book back, right?  

Let's see... shipping is 35 cents per pound, and the book is 4 pounds, so that's 35 times 4, which is $1.40. Then it's 8 cents per mile, and it's 20 miles, so that's 8 times 20, which is $1.60.  

So shipping costs $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will give her back some money, 75% of the $32, which is... hmm... 75 out of 100 is three-quarters, so that's $24.00.

So she loses the $3 for shipping plus the $8 she doesn't get back from the book, which is $3 + $8 = $11.00.



$11.00 

"
"Okay, so Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two pairs, so that's $30 x 2 = $60.  Then the bag is $20, so she spends a total of $60 + $20 = $80.  If she started with $140 and spent $80, she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars every month.  

In the first week, he makes 8,000. The second week he only makes half of that, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

The third week is tricky! He makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Let's see how many he's made so far: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

He needs to make 50,000 total, so in the fourth week he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.


14000 

"
"Okay, so Britany makes a lot of TikToks! Let's see...

* She makes 18 videos a week, and each one is 4 minutes long, so that's 18 times 4, which is 72 minutes.
* She also spends 2 hours on songs, and that's 2 times 60, which is 120 minutes.
* And she does her makeup for 15 minutes each day for 6 days, so that's 15 times 6, which is 90 minutes.

So in total, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 minutes on TikTok each week, which is 282 minutes.

Now, there are 4 weeks in a month, so she spends 282 times 4 minutes on TikTok each month, which is 1128 minutes.

That's a lot of TikTok!

"
"Okay, so the basic install is $129.  

Let's see, she has 2 extra mirrors, and each extra thing costs $15, so that's 2 times 15, which is $30.

She has one extra chandelier, so that's another $15.

And she has 10 extra pictures, so that's 10 times 15, which is $150.

Now we add it all up: $129 + $30 + $15 + $150 = $324.00


$324.00
"
"Okay, so Anthony saved $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20. That means Anthony has $30. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so we gotta figure out what 40% of $30 is.  That's $12.  So Roy saved $30 + $12, which is $42.


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay is way stronger and can lift a mountain 12 times higher, so that's 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger and can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so that's 12 times 4 which is 48 inches. Naruto is the strongest and can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so that's 48 times 10 which is 480 inches.  

But we need to know how many feet that is. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 divided by 12, which is 40 feet high!


40 

"
"Okay, so Mason bikes 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, so that's 8 times 4, which is 32 miles. Then he bikes for another 6 hours, so that's 8 times 6, which is 48 miles.  To find the total, we add those together: 32 + 48 = 80 miles.


80 

"
"Okay, so if three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.

If a turtle is half as fast as a kangaroo, it would take a turtle twice as long, so 54 hours times 2 is 108 hours.

But we have four turtles, so they'd be four times faster than one turtle. That means it would take them 108 hours divided by 4, which is 27 hours.


27 

"
"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  To find the total, we add up all the dishes: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


140 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $600, but it's $200 cheaper if she trades in her old one. That means it'll cost $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80.  She also needs $50 more, so that means she has $150 + $80 = $230.

If she needs $50 more to get to $400, she must have $230 in her purse already.


$230 

"
"Okay, so Adam has 3 big apples and each one makes 5 slices, so that's 3 times 5 which is 15 slices. Then he has 5 small apples and each one makes 3 slices, so that's 5 times 3 which is 15 slices too.  That means he has 15 plus 15, which is 30 slices in total.  He eats 15, so there are 30 minus 15 left.

15 

"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow every day. He has 3 cows, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 liters.

He wants 25 liters, so he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.

That means he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows.

"
"Okay, so each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters.  

* The first one has 1/6 left, so 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 is gone. That's 5/6 * 12 mm = 10 mm used up.

* The second one has 2/3 left, so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 is gone. That's 1/3 * 12 mm = 4 mm used up.

* The third one has 1/2 left, so 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 is gone. That's 1/2 * 12 mm = 6 mm used up.

Now, to find the total unused length, we add up the unused parts of each glue stick: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

"
"Okay, so Gabriel needs $10,800 in total. He already has $5,200.  If we subtract what he has from what he needs, that's $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

"Okay, so Thea gave the guy $80 because four $20 bills is $80.  The hat only cost $70, so she got $10 back.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Craig starts with $40 because 2 twenty dollar bills are $20 each.  The squirt guns cost $12 because 6 squirt guns times $2 each is $12. The water balloons cost $9 because 3 packs times $3 each is $9.  

If he spends $12 + $9 = $21, then he has $19 left because $40 - $21 = $19.


$19 

"
"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes.  That means he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks. Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they have 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes together. 


180
"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids in the class. 5 are only good at math, and 8 are only good at English.  That means the rest are good at both.  

20 - 5 - 8 = 7 kids are good at both.

So, 5 + 7 = 12 kids are good at math.

"
"Okay, so Vicki has 2 hours for the concert, which is 120 minutes.  She needs 10 minutes for a break, so that leaves 110 minutes for the bands. Each band needs 10 minutes (2 to get on, 6 to play, and 2 to get off).  So, she can fit 11 bands in the concert. 

11 

"
"Okay, so Brenda starts with $300.  Each year she earns three-quarters of that amount in interest, which is $300 times 3/4, or $225.

After one year, she has $300 + $225 = $525.

After two years, she has $525 + $225 = $750.

After three years, she has $750 + $225 = $975.


$975 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, which means 20 white shirts don't have collars.  There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons, so 30 floral shirts don't have buttons.  

That means there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.


10 

"
"Okay, so the farmer has a lot of eggs!  He can fit 30 eggs on each tray, and he has 900 eggs total.  That means he has 900 / 30 = 30 trays.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75.


$75 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y.  He sells 10 from Farm X, so there are 55 - 10 = 45 goats left there.  He sells twice that from Farm Y, which is 10 * 2 = 20 goats. So Farm Y has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

In total, he has 45 + 25 = 70 goats left.


70 

"
"Okay, so James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, and that's 2 times 12 months, which is 24 pairs a year.  If he spends $2640 on shoes in a year, we gotta divide that by the 24 pairs.  

$2640 divided by 24 pairs is $110 per pair.


$110 

"
"Okay, so you buy 3 baskets of green food and that's 3 times $25, which is $75. Then you get 3 baskets of red food, but each one is $2 cheaper, so they're $16 each.  That's 3 times $16, which is $48.  

So, the total is $75 + $48 = $123.


$123 

"
"Okay, so they have 90 rooms and want to clean half, which is 45 rooms.  Each room takes 20 minutes to clean.  So, 45 rooms times 20 minutes each is 900 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is equal to 15 hours.


15 

"
"Okay, so they build 12 houses the first year. Then they build 12 times 3, which is 36 houses the next year.  That's 12 + 36 = 48 houses in two years.

Then they double that number, so 48 times 2 is 96 houses.

In total, they build 48 + 96 = 144 houses.


144 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

* My brother is 3 years older than me, so if I'm *x* years old, he's *x + 3*.
* I'm 2 years older than my sister, so she's *x - 2*.
* My mom is tricky - she's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's 3*(x + 3) - 1.

Now, if we add all our ages together, it equals 87:

*x* + *x + 3* + *x - 2* + 3*(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Let's simplify that:

* 4x + 3 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87
* 7x + 11 = 87
* 7x = 76
* x = 10.86

Since you can't be part of a year old, I'm guessing I'm 11 years old.


11
"
"Okay, so Mr. Jackson has 27 kids and each kid needs 2 glue sticks. That's 27 times 2, which is 54 glue sticks.  The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so he needs to buy 54 divided by 8 packs. That's 6 with some leftover. Since he can't buy parts of a pack, he'll need to buy 7 packs.


7 

"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons. Then it rains and there's twice as much water, so that's 4000 times 2 which is 8000 gallons.  On the third day, it goes up by 6000 more gallons, so we add that to the 8000. 8000 plus 6000 is 14000 gallons.


14000 

"
"Okay, so it starts with 10 people sick. Each of them makes 6 more people sick, so that's 10 times 6, which is 60 more people. Now there are 70 sick people.

On the second day, those 70 people each make 6 more sick, so that's 70 times 6, which is 420. Now there are 490 sick people.

On the third day, those 490 people each make 6 more sick, so that's 490 times 6, which is 2940.  That means there are 3430 people sick after three days.


3430 

"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 people, so she made 20 * 40 = $800 in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so she made 10% of $800 which is $80 less.

That means Julieta made $800 - $80 = $720.

Together they made $800 + $720 = $1520.


$1520 

"
"Jennifer gave her daughters 6 oranges (3 daughters x 2 oranges each).  She gave her son 3 oranges. That's a total of 9 oranges given away (6 + 3).

If she started with 12 and gave away 9, she has 3 left (12 - 9).

"
"Okay, so Claire gets 1 badge each month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets 1 badge every 2 months. That means in a whole year, she gets 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges.

Wendy gets 3 times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges each month. In a year, that's 3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges.

Wendy gets way more badges than Amber! She gets 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.


30 

"
"Okay, so Paige bakes 2 banana breads every hour.  She bakes for 5 hours, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 banana breads.

Each banana bread has 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

She sells each slice for 50 cents, so she makes 80 * $0.50 = $40.00.


$40.00 

"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  If she has 70 gold coins, that means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.

To find the total, we add the gold and silver coins: 70 + 40 = 110 coins.


110 

"
"Okay, so Mr. George got 600 burritos.  There are 50 kids in sixth grade, and they each got 10 burritos, so that's 50 x 10 = 500 burritos.  Mr. George ate 20, so that's 500 + 20 = 520 burritos gone.  

That means there are 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left over.


80 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 red cars and 2 less green cars than that, so 10 green cars. Then they have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, which is 30 blue cars.  That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.  If they have 75 cars total, then they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.

"
"Okay, so Fawn, Anne, and Sofie have 85 books all together.  We know Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 less than Fawn.  

To figure out how many books Fawn has, let's think of it like this:

* Let's say Fawn has ""F"" books.
* Anne has 12 less than Fawn, so Anne has F - 12 books.
* Sofie has 25 more than Anne, so Sofie has (F - 12) + 25 books, which is the same as F + 13 books.

Now, if we add up all their books, it should equal 85:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Let's solve for F:

* 3F + 1 = 85
* 3F = 84
* F = 28


So Fawn has 28 books.

"Okay, so Daisy's potatoes weigh 5 pounds. Her sweet potatoes weigh twice that, so they're 5 times 2 which is 10 pounds.  Her carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so they weigh 10 minus 3, which is 7 pounds.


7 

"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to have 4 cups each. That's 30 times 4, which is 120 jello cups.

Each box makes 10 cups, so he needs 120 divided by 10, which is 12 boxes.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 times $1.25, which is $15.00. 


$15.00
"
"Okay, so the phones cost $700 each, and he bought 5, so that's 700 times 5 which is 3500 bucks.  He paid with 4000, so the change is 4000 minus 3500. That's 500 dollars.


$500 

"
"Okay, so Madeline pays for most of the food, right?  If they spend $400 a month and she pays 60%, that means she pays $240.  That leaves $160 for Keenan.  Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 each week.


$40 

"
"Okay, so Tobias ate a lot of pizza! 

* On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, which is like 24 pieces (2/5 * 60 = 24).
* Then he ate 10 more pieces on the second day.
* That leaves 26 pieces left (60 - 24 - 10 = 26).
* On the third day, he ate 7/13 of those 26 pieces, which is 14 pieces (7/13 * 26 = 14).

So in total, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces of pizza.


48 

"
"Okay, so David wants to buy some soda and water.  

Soda costs $3.00 per bottle, and he wants 3 bottles, so that's 3 x $3.00 = $9.00

Water costs $2.00 per bottle, and he wants 2 bottles, so that's 2 x $2.00 = $4.00

In total, it will cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00


$13.00
"
"Okay, so David starts with $12.48.  Each bolt costs 3 cents, and he wants 16 bolts.  

First, we gotta find out how much all the bolts cost: 16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Then we subtract that from how much money he started with: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David has $12.00 left. 


$12.00
"
"Okay, so Ella makes $11 each hour walking dogs. If she walks dogs for 12 hours, she'd make $11 times 12, which is $132.


$132 

"
"Okay, so Paul starts with 52 marbles and gets 28 more, so that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then he loses a quarter of them, which is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.


60 

"
"Okay, so Amy's test has different types of questions worth different points.

* She gets 8 out of 10 multiple-choice right, which is 8 points.
* She gets 18 out of 20 true/false right, which is 18 points.
* For the long answer, she gets 3 out of 5 right, so that's 3 times 5 points, which is 15 points.

If you add all those up, she gets 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points. 

41 

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 extra. He's selling each chicken for $50, and he's bringing 3/5 of his 300 chickens to market. That's 180 chickens!

If he sells all 180 chickens, he'll make 180 * $50 = $9000.

Since he wants to make $2000 profit, that means he bought the chickens for $9000 - $2000 = $7000.


$7000
"
"Okay, so Julie sold 14 glasses. Micah and Mitchell sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

Since they sold the same amount, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.

Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.


5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.  Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, so it was $400 / 4 = $100. Her pedicure cost 3/4 of the manicure price, which is $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


575 

"
"Sarah earns $40 because 20 meters times $2 per meter is $40.  The new rope costs $30 because 20 meters times $1.50 per meter is $30. If she earns $40 and the new rope costs $30, she has $10 left over.


$10 

"
"Melanie is 8 years old now. In 10 years, she'll be 18.  That means she needs to get to 24 years old for her age to be three times what it is now.  

So, 24 - 8 = 16 years.


16 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The bacon cost $10 for 5 packs, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.

The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each pack of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4.  Six packs of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

Strawberries are $4 a pack, so 3 packs cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 each. Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding up everything, Kelly spent $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

If she had $65 to start, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left. 


$5
"
"Okay, so Elaina's final concert is double the length of her normal ones, plus an extra 15 minutes for the encore.  If the whole thing is 65 minutes long, we gotta figure out how long her normal concerts are.

Let's see... if we take away the 15 minutes for the encore, that leaves 50 minutes (65 - 15 = 50).  Since the concert is twice as long as usual, we divide that 50 minutes in half to find the length of a normal concert: 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.


25 

"
"Argo started with 200 toys. He gave away 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.  That means he has 200 - 150 = 50 toys left.


50 

"
"Okay, so they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

On Friday they make double the amount from Tuesday, so that's 125 x 2 = 250 chimichangas.

In total, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.


500 

"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't fit.  That means 10 microphones won't fit (50 x 0.20 = 10).

That leaves 40 microphones that can be used (50 - 10 = 40).

Since microphones are paired up, he can make 20 pairs (40 / 2 = 20).


20 

"
"Okay, so Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then he sees 2/3 of that number flying, which is like 6 divided by 3, which is 2, and then times 2, so that's 4 birds.  He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 3 times 8, which is 24 birds.

To find the total, we add them all up: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds.


34 

"
"Lani had 50 cookies left after she ate some.  She put them in 5 jars, so each jar has 10 cookies.


10
"
"Okay, so Joelle has 5 orchids with 5 petals each, that's 5 times 5 which equals 25 petals.  Her daisies have 10 petals each, and she has 4 of them, so that's 10 times 4 which is 40 petals.  

To find out how many more petals the daisies have, we subtract the orchid petals from the daisy petals: 40 minus 25 equals 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are inside, so that's 100 / 4 = 25 plants.

That leaves 100 - 25 = 75 plants left. Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 75 * (2/3) = 50 plants.

That means 75 - 50 = 25 plants are flowering plants.

To find the percentage, we do (25 / 100) * 100% = 25%


25 

"
"Okay, so the whatchamacallit is super fast, going 121 meters per second!  It's like, eleven times faster than the thingamabob.  That means the thingamabob goes 121 divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second.

The whirligig is five times faster than the thingamabob, so it goes 11 times 5, which is 55 meters per second.


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spends $6 on salad and $3 on yogurt (because it's half the price of the salad). That's $9 total for those two things.  She spends $11 in all, so the carrots cost $2 ($11 - $9 = $2). Since she buys two carrots, each one costs $1 ($2 / 2 = $1).


$1 

"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day, and he works 5 days a week. That's 8 times 5, which is 40 hours a week.

His pay went up to $12 an hour. So to find out how much he makes in a week, we do 40 hours times $12 an hour.

40 x 12 = $480


$480 

"
"This problem is kinda tricky!  We know Tasha made $80 total, but we don't know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn.  

If we knew that, we could figure out how much she made mowing all the lawns, and then subtract that from $80 to find out how much she made from lemonade. 



"
"Okay, so Carl weighs 16 more than Martin, who is 55 kg. That means Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so he weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so he weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John rents his car a lot! He makes $25 each hour, and he rents it for 3 hours, 10 times a month.  That means he makes $25 x 3 x 10 = $750 every month. But he has to pay $500 for the car, so he makes $750 - $500 = $250 profit.


$250 

"
"Martha had 2 notebooks at first because she bought 5 more to get to 7.  Joseph had 6 notebooks because he had 3 times as many as Martha. That means Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.


1 

"
"Okay, so Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than that, so he rowed 10 more miles (50 / 5 = 10).  That means Anis rowed 60 miles (50 + 10 = 60).

To find the total, we add Dijana's distance and Anis's distance: 50 + 60 = 110 miles.


110 

"
"Okay, so Susan had 100 cookies, but her husband ate some. That leaves 96 cookies.  She has 6 nephews, so if she splits them evenly, each nephew gets 16 cookies. 

16 

"
"Okay, so Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, which is 10 + 18 = 28 pages total. Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and zero today, so he read 13 pages total.  

Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.


15 

"
"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for 8 kid bowls, which is the same as 4 adult bowls.  His family is 2 adults and 2 kids, so they'll use up 4 bowls of soup. That leaves 4 bowls leftover. Since there are 2 kids, each kid can have 2 bowls of soup for lunch.


2 

"
"Okay, so William bought 5 notebooks and each notebook costs $1.50.  That means the notebooks cost 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.

The ballpen costs $0.50, so in total he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Jo needs to figure out how much material she needs for all those masks. 

For the small masks, she uses 2 yards for 4 masks, so that's 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards per mask.  She needs 20 small masks, so that's 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

For the big masks, she uses 2.25 yards for 3 masks, so that's 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards per mask. She needs 8 big masks, so that's 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

To get the total, she adds up the material for the small and big masks: 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.


16 

"
"Deepa saw 9 movies times 3, so that's 27 times she went to the movies.  If she spent $216, then each ticket cost $216 divided by 27, which is $8.


$8 

"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps a lot, 10 hours!  He works 2 hours less than that, so 8 hours.  Then he walks his dog for an hour.  That's 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.  

There are 24 hours in a day, so he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours left.


5 

"
"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He uses 3 blue ones for fishing, so he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left.  He uses 1/3 of his red boxes, which is 9 / 3 = 3 red boxes. That means he has 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.

So, he has 4 + 6 = 10 shoeboxes left in total. 

10 

"
"Joseph had 18 books because Sarah had 9 and he had twice that amount. Then he lost 2, so he has 16 books now.

16 

"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (because 30 divided by 5 is 6) and then 10 to Donald.  That's a total of 16 marbles gone.  

If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left.


14 

"
"Okay, so Duncan is 60 now, but eight years ago he was 52.  That means Adam was half Duncan's age back then, so Adam was 26.  If Adam was 26 four years ago, he's 30 now. In eight more years, he'll be 38.


38 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has twice that amount plus 100 more, so that's 200 x 2 = 400 acres, then add 100 more, so 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

To find the total, we add both farms together: 200 + 500 = 700 acres.


700 

"
"Okay, so Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does 10 less than 50 an hour, so that's 40 packages.  

That means he makes 40 times 20 cents, which is $8.00 every hour.

If he works 8 hours, he makes $8.00 times 8, so he earns $64.00 a day.


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times longer than a normal one, which is 45 minutes.  That means it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

He drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, so in 180 minutes he drinks 180 / 30 = 6 bottles.


6 

"
"Okay, so Benny used 2 pieces of bologna for each red balloon and he had 20 red balloons. That's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna just for the red ones.

He used 58 pieces total, so he used 58 - 40 = 18 pieces for the yellow balloons.

Since he used 3 pieces for each yellow balloon, there were 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.


6 

"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles a day, and he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  If he drives for a whole month, that's 30 days times 100 miles a day, which is 3000 miles.  

Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3 tune-ups that month. 


3
"
"Okay, so Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.  Then on Wednesday he works twice that, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 hours. On Thursday he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 10 minus 2 which is 8 hours.

To find the total, we add up all the hours: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.


23 

"
"Okay, so they spent $11 on a cake and $3 on balloons, that's $14 already. Then they spent another $14 on ice cream.  So all together they spent $14 + $14 = $28.

Since they each chipped in the same amount, they each had $28 / 2 = $14. 


$14
"
"Kira bought a bunch of fruit: 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.

Lola ate 2, so there are 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left.


12 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 kids playing tennis and double that playing volleyball, so that's 6 times 2 which is 12 kids.  Then there's 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so that's 16 plus 22 which is 38 kids.  

Now we add up all the kids: 6 plus 12 plus 38 equals 56 kids.


56 

"
"Okay, so they sold 300 lollipops because 30 students sold 10 each.  If they sold them for 80 cents each, they made 300 x $0.80 = $240. But they spent 300 x $0.50 = $150 to buy them. So they made a profit of $240 - $150 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, so Larry has a lot of pets! Let's see... he has 3 cats.  He has 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  He has 3 times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 7 x 3 = 21 fish. And lastly, he has 1/3 the number of gerbils as fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total, we add up all the pets: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.


47 

"
"Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats double that, so he eats 2 * 2 = 4 slices. Together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices every day.  The bread has 24 slices, so it will last 24 / 6 = 4 days.

4 

"
"Martha collects shells for 5 years, and she gets one new shell each month.  So that's 5 years times 12 months a year, which equals 60 months. Since she gets one shell per month, she'll have 60 shells.


60 

"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups and puts them in 3 rows, so that's 9 cups in each row.  She wants the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row. That means each row has 9 cups / 2 types of tea = 4.5 cups of each.


4.5 

"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each trip up and down the tree.  If he has 8 hours, he can do 8 / 4 = 2 trips.

He needs to get 24 berries, so he needs to get 24 / 2 = 12 berries each time he goes down.


12 

"
"Okay, so the pool has 10,000 gallons, and they use half for the tank, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Then they use 500 gallons each day for 6 days, so that's 500 * 6 = 3,000 gallons used up.

That means they have 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 gallons left in the tank.


2000 

"
"Okay, so Colby has $150 for movies this month.  He already spent some on tickets and snacks. Let's see how much he has left.

He saw 5 movies on Friday or Saturday, and those cost $10 each, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.

He saw 8 movies on other days, and those cost $7 each, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.

He bought 2 popcorns at $8 each, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.

He got 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Now let's add up all that spending: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

Since tickets on Friday cost $10, he can see $20 / $10 = 2 movies tonight. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Andrew made a bunch of mini pastries.  

The cinnamon rolls are mini, so they only have 200 calories each (600 calories / 3 = 200 calories). He made 200 of those, so that's 40,000 calories total (200 rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories).

The blueberry muffins are also mini, so they have 150 calories each (450 calories / 3 = 150 calories). He made 300 of those, so that's 45,000 calories (300 muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories).

To find the total calories, we add the cinnamon roll calories and the muffin calories: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.


85000 

"
"Okay, so Rita got rid of a bunch of Junebugs! Let's see...

* On Tuesday and Wednesday, she got twice as many as Monday, so that's 39 x 2 = 78 Junebugs each day.
* That's 78 x 2 = 156 Junebugs for both those days.
* Altogether, she got 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.
* To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.


60 

"
"Okay, so the bus goes 60 miles every hour for 5 hours. That means it went 60 * 5 = 300 miles.

The car goes 30 miles every hour for 8 hours, so it went 30 * 8 = 240 miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance: 300 - 240 = 60 miles.


60 

"
"Okay, so Sophie has a bunch of toys: 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings. That's 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys.

She has 62 toys total, so she must have 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls.


14 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how old Peter is.

We know that Peter, Paul, and John's ages all add up to 100. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

Let's think about it like this:

* If Paul is 10 years older than John, we can think of their ages like this: John's age + 10 = Paul's age.

* Peter's age is John's age + Paul's age, so it's like adding John's age + John's age + 10.

* That means Peter's age is 2 times John's age plus 10.

Now we need to figure out what John's age is so we can find Peter's age.  We know all their ages add up to 100, so we can try some numbers to see if we can figure it out.

Let me know if you want to try guessing John's age together!



"
"Okay, so Maria gave her friends 8 balloons total (4 friends x 2 balloons each).  She had 1, so that's 9 balloons to start. Then her mom gave them 15 more (5 people x 3 balloons each).  So they had 24 balloons in all!

24 

"
"Okay, so they have a lot of stuff!  Let's see... 10 people gave 5 boxes each, so that's 10 times 5, which is 50 boxes.  They already had 10, so that's 50 plus 10, which is 60 boxes total.

Each table holds 2 boxes, so they need 60 divided by 2, which is 30 tables.  They already have 15, so they need 30 minus 15, which is 15 more tables.


15 

"
"Okay, so Zoey spits her seeds 40 times and each one goes 10 feet, so that's 40 * 10 = 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds and each goes 12 feet, so that's 35 * 12 = 420 feet.  

To find the average, we add up the total distance and divide by the number of people: (400 + 420) / 2 = 410 feet.


410 

"
"Okay, so Fern wants to make the most money, right?

The Widgeteer 3000 makes way more widgets than the WidgetMaster 9000. It makes 60 an hour, and the other one only makes 45.  If it runs all day and all month, that's a lot of extra widgets!

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 will make Fern $64,800 more than the WidgetMaster 9000.


64800 

"
"Okay, so Cameron stays for 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.

So, he has to pay for 5 extra hours, which is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

That means his total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

A full 24 hours would cost 1600 pesos, so he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.


250 

"
"Okay, so each goat eats 5 pounds of hay.  There are 15 goats, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Sheep eat a little less. They eat 2 times what a goat eats, minus 3 pounds. So that's (2 * 5) - 3 = 7 pounds of hay per sheep.

There are 12 sheep, so they eat 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay. 


159
"
"Okay, so John makes $50 each hour and worked for 6 hours, so he made 50 * 6 = $300.

Then he spends $50 on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = $250 left.

He buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so those cost 5 * 10 = $50.

Now he has 250 - 50 = $200 left.

He puts $100 in the bank, leaving him with 200 - 100 = $100.

Each pen costs $25, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, that's 20 times 15 which equals 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than that, so he spelled 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.  To find the total, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters: 300 plus 350 equals 650.


650 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 kids in each row, and 7 rows for each school. That means each school has 8 times 7, which is 56 kids.  Since there are 5 schools, we multiply 56 by 5 to get the total number of kids. 

56 times 5 is 280.


280 

"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons and each one gets her 100 bottles of juice, so that's 9 times 100, which is 900 bottles.  Then she gives each of the 29 kids 2 bottles, so that's 29 times 2, which is 58 bottles.  If she starts with 900 and gives away 58, she has 900 minus 58 left.  That's 842 bottles.


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come over. Then she charges $35 for every hour she works, even if she doesn't work a full hour.  She worked for 2.25 hours, so that's 2.25 times $35, which is $78.75.  

Then she used $60 in parts.  So to find the total, we add up all the costs: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75


$178.75
"
"Okay, so James bought 10 CDs for $15 each, so that's 10 times 15 which is $150.  But they were 40% off, so we gotta figure out what 40% of $150 is.  That's $60.  So he paid $150 minus $60, which is $90.

Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, so that's 5 times 40, which is $200.

Finally, we subtract how much he paid from how much he made: $200 minus $90 is $110.


$110 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 6 yams at $1.50 each, that's 6 times 1.50 which is $9.00.  Then she has 10 sweet potatoes at $2.00 each, so that's 10 times 2, which is $20.00. And lastly, she has 4 carrots at $1.25 each, so that's 4 times 1.25, which is $5.00.

If we add all that up, $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00


$34.00 

"
"Okay, so James swims 60% of the lake first, which is 20 miles times 0.60, that's 12 miles.

He swims that at 2 miles per hour, so that takes him 12 miles divided by 2 miles per hour, which is 6 hours.

He rests for half that time, so 6 hours divided by 2 is 3 hours.

He has 8 miles left to go (20 miles - 12 miles). But now he's tired, so he only swims at 1 mile per hour.

That last part takes him 8 miles divided by 1 mile per hour, which is 8 hours.

So, in total, it takes him 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to cross the lake.

"
"Okay, so the bakery has seven times the amount of bread Sam had, which is 7 * 70 = 490 loaves. But then they have 40 less than that, so 490 - 40 = 450 loaves.


450 

"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers, then lost 7, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.  Then her teacher gave her 5 more, so she has 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.


13 

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10 cents for every New York Times he sells and 8 cents for every Wall Street Journal.

He sells 6 New York Times, so he makes 10 cents x 6 = 60 cents from those.

He sells 10 Wall Street Journals, so he makes 8 cents x 10 = 80 cents from those.

In total, he makes 60 cents + 80 cents = $1.40.


$1.40 

"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so he's 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be twice as old as Marcus. That means Leo is 21 times 2, which is 42.


42 

"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most points, and we know the team scored 45 points total.  

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points. Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

To find out how many points Azibo scored, we add up all the points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 3x = 15

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5


Answer: 5 

"
"Okay, so the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages.  That means there are 1.5 x 100 = 150 pages in the book.


150 

"
"Okay, so Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 hours (from 8 am to 11 pm). That's 900 minutes total (15 hours * 60 minutes).

If he staples for 15 minutes at a time, he does that 60 times (900 minutes / 15 minutes).

So, he staples 1800 reports in total (60 times * 30 reports).


1800 

"
"Okay, so Kim sleeps for 8 hours normally. That's 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for a bit, so we gotta take that out.  2:15 to 2:38 is 23 minutes.  

So 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.

But she woke up early too, 5 minutes early. So 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.


452 

"
"Okay, so Jonathan has 24 cups because two dozen is 2 times 12.  He has 16 spoons because 2/3 of 24 is 16. After he gives Pedro some spoons, he only has 10 left.  So, he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils.


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, which is 200 beds. That means 800 beds are empty.

Then, they get 50 new patients every day for two weeks. Two weeks is 14 days, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Now, there are 200 + 700 = 900 patients in the hospital.

So, there are 1000 - 900 = 100 empty beds left.


Answer: 100 

"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  She sends 7 for work, so that leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails left.

Two-thirds of those are to her family, so that's 9 * (2/3) = 6 emails.

That means she sends 9 - 6 = 3 emails to her boyfriend. 


3
"
"Okay, so Aliya is 3. Shawna is three times older than Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's dad is five times older than Shawna, so he's 5 * 9 = 45 years old.


45 

"
"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people, but she was off by 20%.  That means she counted 20% too many people. To find out how many were really there, we gotta figure out what 20% of 48 is.

20% is like 20 out of every 100, so we can do (20/100) * 48 = 9.6.

That means Courtney counted 9.6 people too many.  So we take that away from her number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since you can't have part of a person, there were probably about 38 people at the concert.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls.  Jeffrey carried half that amount, which is 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 4 balls.  To find the total, we add them up: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.


7 

"
"Okay, so they dug a bunch of holes, right?  

* Day one: 10 holes
* Day two: 13 holes
* Day three: 8 holes, but they filled in 2, so that's 6 new holes.

That's 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes total.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one. So, there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of day one. That doesn't make sense, so maybe the map was a little wrong.

Anyway, they had 29 holes at the end of day three, and they only had 7 at the end of day one. That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on day four.


22 

"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips.  Collins got 15 more than them, so he got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.

To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400.  The tickets cost 50% more than that, so we need to figure out what 50% of $400 is.  Half of $400 is $200, so 50% is also $200.  

That means the tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600.


$600
"
"Okay, so they caught a total of 339 Pokemon, right?  

Let's see... Adelwolfe caught some, and Stan caught 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught.  Alex caught 5 more than Stan.  

Hmm, this is kinda tricky.  

Let's say Adelwolfe caught ""A"" Pokemon. Then Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, and Alex caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

If we add all those together, it should equal 339. So, A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13) + 5 = 339

Let me simplify that... 9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9: A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, to find out how many Stan caught, we do 4 * 40 - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147



**Answer:** 147 

"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes long.  And there are 10 episodes because 20 divided by 2 is 10.  So, to find out the total time, we do 10 episodes times 20 minutes each, which equals 200 minutes.


200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 times 30 which is 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so that's 2 times 18 which is 36 miles.  Then it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 times 22 which is 110 miles.

So, it flew 300 miles south, then 36 miles north, then 110 miles south. To find the total distance south, we do 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.


374 

"
"Okay, so Greta got a bunch of brownies!

* She made 12.
* Her office gave her 6 more.
* Her friends brought 48! That's a lot of brownies.

So, she had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

Then they ate 18.

That means she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left. 


48
"
"Okay, so Nani is 8. His brother is twice that, so he's 8 times 2 which is 16. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so she's 8 minus 2, which is 6.  

To find their total age, we add them all up: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30


30 

"
"Okay, so Andy has to string a bunch of tennis racquets.  

Let's see... 3 racquets take 15 minutes each, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

The polyester ones take longer, 22 minutes each, and he's doing 5 of those, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

The hybrid ones take 18 minutes each, and he's got 4 of them, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Now, to find the total time, we add it all up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.


227 

"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, which is $600 each, so that's 2 * $600 = $1200.

The other two phones are half price, so they each cost $600 / 2 = $300.

That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

In total, he spent $1200 + $600 = $1800 on all the phones.


$1800 

"
"Okay, so Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13. That means Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.  

To find the total, we add the number of players on both teams: 20 + 13 = 33 players.


33 

"
"Okay, so Robert needs to find out how much fencing he needs first.  

Since it's a rectangle, you add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet of fencing.

He needs 2 slats for every foot, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.


100 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 to her sister, so that's 4 boxes gone.  That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She kept a quarter of those, which is 8 * (1/4) = 2 boxes.

That means she sold 8 - 2 = 6 boxes.

Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 * 20 = 120 oranges.


120 

"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states.  Half of that is 25. India has 4 more than that, so they have 29 states.  If you add those together, there are 79 states in total.

"
"Okay, so Tyler needs to figure out how much money he still needs and then how many hours he has to work to earn that much.

The books cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $39 total.

He already has $14, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.

If he earns $5 each hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Robert has 30 cherries and Richard has 10 less than that, which is 20 cherries.  That means Richard and Robert have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries together.  If they have 60 cherries total, then Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. 


20
"
"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie. Let's figure out how much he made!

On Saturday, he sold 10 gingerbread and 6 apple pies (because he sold 4 fewer apple pies than gingerbread).

* Gingerbread earnings on Saturday: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
* Apple pie earnings on Saturday: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90

On Sunday, he sold 15 gingerbread (5 more than Saturday) and 15 apple pies.

* Gingerbread earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90
* Apple pie earnings on Sunday: 15 boxes * $15/box = $225

Now let's add up all his earnings:

* Total Saturday earnings: $60 + $90 = $150
* Total Sunday earnings: $90 + $225 = $315
* Total earnings for both days: $150 + $315 = $465


$465
"
"Okay, so Pamela needs sunscreen for 4 hours each day for 8 days. That's 4 times 8, which is 32 hours.

She uses a whole ounce every hour, so she'll need 32 ounces of sunscreen.

Each bottle has 8 ounces, so she'll need 32 divided by 8, which is 4 bottles.

"
"Okay, so the blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper, so it costs $60.  If you add those together, both cars cost $160.

"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now.  In 5 years, he'll be 24.  That's when he'll be half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 times 2, which is 48.  And his brother will be half Emil's age then, so he'll be 12.

But we want to know their ages *now*.  So the dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old, and the brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

If we add those together, 43 + 7 = 50.


50 

"
"Okay, so Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her double what her mom gave her, which is 20 x 2 = 40 beads.  To find the total, we add them all up: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.


90 

"
"Okay, so Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday. Then on Friday, he caught 4 times that, which is 3 times 4, or 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, so that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6 pounds.

To find out how many servings he has, we add up all the pounds: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 divided by 3, which is 7 servings. 


7 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 kids in the class.  20% of them play football, so that's 30 times 0.20 which is 6 kids.

That leaves 24 kids who aren't football players. 25% of those kids are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 times 0.25 which is 6 kids.

So, a total of 6 football players plus 6 cheerleaders/band kids equals 12 kids leaving early.


12 

"
"Okay, so Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots. That means Charlie wears a size 5 * 5 = 25.

To find the average, we add their sizes together: 5 + 25 = 30.

Then we divide that by 2 because there are two people: 30 / 2 = 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Pat's flower bed is super long, 111 feet!  But her flowers only grow 12 inches wide, and she needs to leave space between them.  

First, let's figure out how many inches the whole flower bed is: 111 feet times 12 inches per foot is 1332 inches.

Each plant needs 12 inches for itself plus 18 inches of space, so that's 30 inches total.

Now we divide the total inches of the bed by how much space each plant needs: 1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4 plants. Since you can't buy parts of plants, she needs to buy 45 plants.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so 28 plants times $6 per plant is $168.

"
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  

In a week, he eats 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

63 

"
"Okay, so Katherine needs 3 petunias times $3.00 each, which is $9.00. Then she needs 2 sweet potato vines times $2.50 each, which is $5.00.  So each basket costs $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Since she has 5 baskets, it'll cost her $14.00 times 5, which is $70.00.


$70.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 30 pounds of soil. Sunflowers take up a lot of soil, 3 pounds each, and they're planting 4, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.  Carnations need 1.5 pounds each, and they're doing 10 of those, so that's 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

That means they've used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds already.  They started with 30, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left for roses.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses. 


3
"
"Okay, so Jessica saves 25% of her $2000 paycheck, which is $500 every month.  That means she saves $500 x 12 = $6000 in a year.

Since each pair of shoes costs $1000, she can buy $6000 / $1000 = 6 pairs of shoes. 


6
"
"Okay, so Emily peels shrimp pretty fast! She can do 6 shrimp every minute.  If she needs to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 divided by 6, which is 15 minutes.

Cooking is a little slower. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So for 90 shrimp, it'd take her three times as long, which is 30 minutes.

To get the total time, we add the peeling time and cooking time: 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.


45 

"
"Okay, so the AC cools the room down.  

* On low, it cools 2 degrees each hour, and it was on low for 3 hours, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 degrees cooler.
* Then it was on high, cooling 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 degrees cooler.
* That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.
* But then it was off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees each hour, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 degrees warmer.
* So, the room ended up 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it started. 


14
"
"Okay, so Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30. Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

The comet comes around every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, so that means it had been 90 / 75 = 1.2 times around the sun since his dad saw it.

That means Bill was 75 years old when he first saw the comet.

"
"Okay, so Buford pays his electric and gas bills every month, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives money to the church twice a month, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 checks. And he pays for the yard stuff four times a year.

Let's add it all up: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks.

"
"Okay, so the first plane flies a lot! It goes to Greece most of the time, like 3 out of every 4 times.  The other plane only goes to Poland, and it flies 44 times a day. That's only half as many times as the first plane, so the first plane flies 44 * 2 = 88 times.

If it goes to Greece 3/4 of the time, that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights to Greece.

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since it splits those flights evenly, it goes to France 22 / 2 = 11 times.


11 

"
"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so he howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two together, so that's 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

To find the total time, we add up all their howl times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

"
"Okay, so we know Helene is twice as old as the average age of all the kids.  If all the kids' ages added up equal 20, then the average age is 20 divided by 4, which is 5. That means Helene is 5 times 2, which is 10 years old.

Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.  

If Helene is 10 and Akbar and Alessandro are 7 together, that's 10 + 7 = 17 years.

Since all the kids' ages add up to 20, Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

"Okay, so Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from online, that's $2000 total. His lawyer is gonna give three times that much, so that's $2000 times 3 which is $6000!  

6000 

"
"Okay, so there were a lot of cookies! 100 guests times 15 cookies each is 1500 cookies.  The bride gave half of them away, so that's 1500 divided by 2, which is 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 divided by 15, which equals 50 people.

"
"Okay, so there are 2 adults and 4 kids, right?  And the adults get twice as much watermelon as each kid.  

Let's say each kid gets one slice. That means each adult gets two slices.

So, that's 4 slices for the kids and 4 slices for the adults, for a total of 8 slices.

Each adult gets 2 out of the 8 slices, which is like 25%.

"
"Okay, so Dr. Jones works for 9 hours.  He spends 20 minutes on each of his 9 patients, so that's 9 times 20 which is 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours right there! Then he has 10 appointments at 30 minutes each, so that's 10 times 30 which is 300 minutes. That's 5 more hours.  So he's already spent 3 plus 5 which is 8 hours.

That means he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for his records.

"Okay, so Jordan needs 20 minutes to mix the batter, 30 minutes to bake it, and then it has to cool for 2 hours. That's 120 minutes for cooling! Plus, she needs another 10 minutes to frost it.

Let's add it all up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

That's 3 hours total!  If she wants the cake ready by 5:00 pm, she needs to start at 2:00 pm.


2:00 pm

"Okay, so Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes and Peter sold 4 and a half, that's a total of 8 boxes.  They sold 64 chocolate bars all together.  To find out how many are in each box, you just divide: 64 divided by 8 is 8.

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the studio, and then $1.50 for each student.  Since there are 10 students, that's $1.50 x 10 = $15 extra per session.

So each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They have classes 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 each week.

In a month, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480.


$480 

"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split into 4 boxes, which means each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each of her boxes has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

That means Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of them are girls. That means there are 30 girl porcupines (50 x 3/5 = 30).

Each girl porcupine has 4 babies every month, so that's 120 babies each month (30 x 4 = 120).

In a year, there are 12 months, so there would be 1440 babies born (120 x 12 = 1440).

If you add the babies to the original number of porcupines, there would be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year (50 + 1440 = 1490).


1490 

"
"Okay, so they need to figure out how much water their pool holds.  

First, you multiply the length, width, and depth: 25 feet x 14 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Then, they said to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons: 1400 cubic feet x 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, they pay 10 cents for each gallon, so it'll cost 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00 to fill it up.


$826.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add up all the sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.


34 

"
"Okay, so Matteo drove 55 miles every hour for 4 hours, so he drove 55 * 4 = 220 miles.

Shandy drove 45 miles every hour for 10 hours, so she drove 45 * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so half of the 3000 students are older than 16, which is 1500 students.  A quarter of those older students are boys, so that's 1500 divided by 4, which is 375 boys. That means 1125 of the older students are girls.

The other half of the students are younger than 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, so that's 750 boys. That means 750 of the younger students are girls.

To find the total number of girls, we add the girls who are older and the girls who are younger: 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls.


1875
"
"Okay, so Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 less than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn.

"
"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill a big tank. It holds 18,000 gallons of water.

On the first day, Wanda filled a quarter of the tank, which is 18,000 / 4 = 4,500 gallons. Ms. B filled three-quarters of what Wanda did, so she pumped 4,500 * (3/4) = 3,375 gallons.

That means on the first day they put in 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda filled two-thirds of what she did on the first day, which is 4,500 * (2/3) = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B only filled one-third of what she did on the first day, so she pumped 3,375 * (1/3) = 1,125 gallons.

So on the second day, they added 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

In total, they filled 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

To find out how much more they need, we subtract that from the tank's size: 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.



**Answer:** 6000 

"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank was losing power while it was charging her friends' phones.  

First, it lost 9% every hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.

Then it lost 7% every hour for 3 hours, so that's 7 * 3 = 21% more gone.

That means it lost a total of 45 + 21 = 66% of its charge.

If it had 28% left at the end, and that's after losing 66%, then it must have started with 28 + 66 = 94% charge.

But wait, that doesn't make sense! Power banks can't be more than 100% charged.  

That means there must be a mistake somewhere in the problem. Maybe Maria's power bank wasn't losing charge as fast as we thought? 



"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour at her job and gets another $15 an hour in tips. That's $25 an hour total! If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 times 40, which is $1000 a week.

She needs 20% of $10,000 for a down payment, so that's $10,000 times 0.20, which is $2000.

To figure out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 divided by $1000 is 2.

"
"Okay, so Jamaar spent $1.50 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $2.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples. That's a total of $9.25.

If he started with $10.00, he has $0.75 left. Plums cost $0.25 each, so he can buy 3 plums.

"
"Okay, so Anne had 15 packs of candy with 60 pieces each, that's 15 times 60 which is 900 pieces total. She kept 2 packs for herself, so that's 2 times 60 or 120 pieces.  That leaves 900 minus 120, which is 780 pieces for her friends. She has 10 friends, so each friend gets 780 divided by 10, which is 78 pieces.


78 

"
"Okay, so the carrots start at $120.  Each year they go up by 5%, which is like adding 5 out of every 100 dollars to the price.

* After one year, they'd be $120 + ($120 * 0.05) = $126

* After two years, they'd be $126 + ($126 * 0.05) = $132.30

* After three years, they'd be $132.30 + ($132.30 * 0.05) = $138.92

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years. 


$139
"
"Okay, so Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, so each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.

She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.

And she has 2 albums of portraits, which is 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.

So she has a total of 27 + 18 = 45 selfies and portraits. 


45
"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, we gotta figure out how many sets of 3 pages that is. 

18 pages / 3 pages per set = 6 sets of pages

Since each set takes 10 minutes, he reads for 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.


60 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 people at the hotel at first. Then 24 left early, so there were 100 - 24 = 76 people left.

Then 15 people wanted to stay later, and twice that many, or 15 * 2 = 30 people, checked in. So now there are 76 + 30 = 106 people.

Finally, 7 more people came after dinner, so there are 106 + 7 = 113 people at the hotel.


113 

"
"Okay, so John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday, then 6 on Thursday. On Friday, he picks three times the amount from Wednesday, so that's 4 x 3 = 12 bananas.

To find the total, we add up all the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bananas.


22 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.  40% of them are easy, which is 60 * 0.40 = 24 questions. That leaves 36 questions that are either average or hard.

Since they're split evenly, there are 36 / 2 = 18 average questions and 18 hard questions.

Aries gets 75% of the easy ones right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct.

She gets half of the average and hard ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 average questions right and 18 * 0.50 = 9 hard questions right.

In total, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.


36
"
"Okay, so Teresa sells the big stuffed animals for $12 each because they're three times the price of the small ones.  She sold twice as many small ones as big ones, and made $120 total.  The small ones cost $4 each.

Let's see... if she sold 'x' number of big ones, she sold 2x small ones.  That means she made 12x dollars from the big ones and 8x dollars from the small ones.  

So, 12x + 8x = $120. That's 20x = $120.  

If we divide both sides by 20, we get x = 6.  

She sold 6 big ones, so she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small ones.


12 

"
"Okay, so they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.  

In a week, that's 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches.


77 

"
"Okay, so Suzanne made $80 from the cookies and $240 from the cupcakes. That's a total of $320.  Then she gave her sisters $20.  So she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 * 2 = 60 eggs.  If 10 eggs were left over, then their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, so one dwarf can dig up 12 pounds of ore a day with just his hands.  If he uses an iron pickaxe, he can dig up twice that much, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds.

A steel pickaxe is even better! It lets him dig 50% more than the iron pickaxe.  That means he digs up 24 * 0.50 = 12 more pounds.

So with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf digs up 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

In a month, that's 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

If we have 40 dwarves, they'd dig up 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds!


43200 

"
"Okay, so the store sells sandwiches in packs.  The pack with 4 sandwiches costs $6, so each sandwich costs $1.50.  If you get 8 sandwiches, that's 8 times the amount in the pack of 1, so it would cost 8 x $1.50 = $12.00


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000 but gets $1000 from selling his old one. That means he still owes $2000.  

If he has to pay 10% each month, that's $2000 times 0.10 which equals $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, so Sally starts with a bunch of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.  Then some blow away! 40% of the red ones pop, which is 10 balloons (25 x 0.4 = 10).  She loses half her yellow balloons too, so that's 6 gone (12 / 2 = 6).

Then she finds some blue balloons, 8 of them! She takes 75% of those, which is 6 blue balloons (8 x 0.75 = 6).

So, let's add up what she has left: 15 red (25 - 10) + 6 yellow (12 - 6) + 6 blue = 27 balloons.


27 

"
"Okay, so Marcus has a few things going on.  

There's a 50/50 chance he'll get a sub, and subs don't care about homework. So that's good.

If his regular teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone more time. That means 60% of the time she won't.

Even if she doesn't give everyone more time, there's still a chance Marcus can lie about his dog eating it. That's a 20% chance.

So, let's see... 60% chance she doesn't give everyone more time, and then 80% chance he can't get out of it.  That's 60 times 80, which is 48%.

So there's a 48% chance he has to do it.


Answer: 48 

"
"Okay, so they have 6000 seats but 950 are for the graduates and 300 are for teachers. That means 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats are left for everyone else.

If there are 950 graduates, each graduate gets 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets.


5 

"
"Okay, so Grandpa eats a lot of jelly beans!  He can eat 75 big ones.  He can eat twice as many medium ones, so that's 75 x 2 = 150 medium jelly beans.

And get this, 3 small ones are the same as 1 medium one. So he can eat 150 x 3 = 450 small jelly beans!


450 

"
"Okay, so Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, that's 6 times 3 which is 18 hours.

She makes $15 each day, so for 3 days she makes 15 times 3 which is $45.

Parking costs $3 each day, so for 3 days it's 3 times 3 which is $9.

If she makes $45 and spends $9 on parking, she has $45 - $9 = $36 left.

So, she makes $36 for 18 hours of work. That means she makes $36 divided by 18 which is $2 per hour.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Ted spent $48 on books because 3 books times $16 each is $48.  He spent $18 on pencils because 3 pencils times $6 each is $18.  If you add those together, he spent a total of $66.


66 

"
"Okay, so Richard has a driveway that's 24 feet wide and he puts a soda bottle every 3 feet.  That means he can fit 8 bottles (24 / 3 = 8).

He takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 7 spaces between 8 bottles, it'll take him 35 seconds to set them all up (7 x 5 = 35).


35 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes with 40 apples each, so that's 2 * 40 = 80 apples total.  If he puts 8 apples in each pack, he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs.


10 

"
"Okay, so Amor buys Parmesan for $11 a pound and she gets 2 pounds, so that's 2 times 11 which is $22.  Then she gets mozzarella for $6 a pound and she gets 3 pounds, so that's 3 times 6 which is $18.  

So all together the cheese costs $22 plus $18 which is $40. If she started with $50, she has $50 minus $40 left, which is $10.


$10 

"
"Okay, so Jim borrowed a lot of money for college, right?  He borrowed $50,000 each year for four years, so that's $50,000 x 4 = $200,000.

He also didn't make any money while he was in school. He used to make $25,000 a year, and he was in school for four years, so he missed out on $25,000 x 4 = $100,000.

That means he needs to earn back $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

His new job pays him $75,000 a year, so it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years to earn it all back. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jim's bed is 6 feet by 8 feet. He needs the fabric to be 2 feet longer and wider on each side, so that means:

* The fabric needs to be 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 feet long.
* The fabric needs to be 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday.  On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's amount.  One-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 divided by 5, which is 85.  So Tuesday they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's amount is 102 times 2, which is 204.  So Wednesday they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total, we add up all the letters: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.


736 

"
"Okay, so Molly has 16 people coming to the party.  10 want chicken salad at $6.50 each, so that's 10 times 6.50 which is $65.00. Then 6 people want pasta salad at $6.00 each, so that's 6 times 6 which is $36.00.  To find the total, we add those together: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00


$101.00 

"
"Okay, so Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second race.  But then he lost $16.50 on the third race.  

To find the average, you add up all the money he lost and divide by the number of races. So, $5 + $16.50 = $21.50 lost total.  Then $21.50 divided by 3 races is $7.17.


$7.17 

"
"Okay, so there are 26 countries in South America, and each one has 5 cities with 1000 people in each city.  

To find the total, we multiply: 26 countries * 5 cities/country * 1000 people/city = 130,000 people


130,000 

"
"Okay, so Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so now he's 51 inches tall. Cole was already 50 inches and grew 2 inches, making him 52 inches tall.  

That means Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier.

"
"Let's figure this out!

If the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got twice what the second got, we can use some algebra.

Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars.

* The second person got x + $80.
* The third person got 2 * (x + $80) which is 2x + $160.

All together they got $1920, so:

x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x's and the dollar amounts: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Dividing both sides by 4: x = $420


$420
"
"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day. That's like 9 hours because 3 times 12 is 36 and 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, and then times 2 is 9.

They worked for 3 weeks, which is 21 days. So each painter worked 9 hours a day for 21 days.

That's 9 times 21, which is 189 hours.


189 

"
"Okay, so Rory picked up some tennis balls.  Let's see...

* The second set had the fewest balls. Let's say he got 'x' balls in the second set.
* The first set had 4 more than the second, so that's x + 4 balls.
* The third set was half the amount of the second set, so that's x / 2 balls.

He got 19 balls total, so we can add those up: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Hmm, let's solve for x.  

* Combine the x's: 2.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, the second set had 6 balls. The first set had 4 more, which is 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Okay, so the car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, it would be worth 20000 - (20000 * 0.21) = $15800
* In 2009, it would be worth 15800 - (15800 * 0.21) = $12478
* In 2010, it would be worth 12478 - (12478 * 0.21) = $9860.62

"
"Okay, so half the books are in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.  Then 10% are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books in English or German.  So the rest must be in Spanish, which is 50 - 30 = 20 books.


20 

"
"Okay, so Bernice wants to drive from San Diego to New York. That's a long way!  

She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, so she drove a total of 325 x 4 = 1300 kilometers.

If the whole trip is 1955 kilometers, she still has to drive 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers.


655 

"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups a day, and there are 16 cups in a gallon.  That means she drinks half a gallon each day (8 / 16 = 0.5).

Over 30 days, she'd drink 15 gallons (0.5 x 30 = 15).

"
"Okay, so there were 120 people on the train at first. Then 20 more got on, so there were 140.  Then 50 got off, but 100 got on, so now there are 190. Finally, 80 people got off, leaving 110 people on the train.

"
"Okay, so Alison bought a tank top for $10. Her shorts were $5 more, so those were $15. Her shoes were half off of $48, so they were $24. And her socks were $8 but she had a coupon for $2 off, so those were $6.  

Let's add it all up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55


55 

"
"Okay, so you need to cover 200 square feet, and each tile is one square foot. That means you need 200 tiles.  If each tile costs $12, then you'll need 200 times $12, which is $2400.


$2400 

"
"Okay, so his insurance went up because of the accident.  It's 60% more than the normal $120.  That means it went up by 60/100 * $120 = $72.

So now his insurance costs $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

For a whole year, that's $192 * 12 = $2304.


$2304 

"
"Okay, so Greg washes sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can only do 2 sets of twin sheets at once and 1 king set at a time.  

Let's see... he needs to do 4 twin sheets / 2 sheets per load = 2 loads for the twin beds.

Then he needs 1 load for the king-size bed.

So that's 2 + 1 = 3 loads every week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads a year.


156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half of that on Sunday, which is 2 movies. That means they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies every weekend.

Over 4 weeks, they'd watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies.


24 

"
"Okay, so Leo started with 100 stickers. Then he got 50 more last year. This year he got double that, so that's 50 x 2 = 100 stickers.

In total, he got 50 + 100 = 150 new stickers.

Now he has 100 + 150 = 250 stickers!


250 

"
"Okay, so Imma has 3 cats and feeds them 60 grams of food each, twice a day. That means she uses 3 * 60 = 180 grams of food every day.

If she has 720 grams of food, it will last for 720 / 180 = 4 days.


4 

"
"Okay, so there were 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, that's 4 * 8 = 32 slices total.

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 less than Becky, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate double what Jake ate, so she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total, we add up what everyone ate: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

"
"Let's see... Donovan's part took less time than Betsy's.  If their times added up to 98 minutes, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer, I can try subtracting 18 from the total time: 98 - 18 = 80.

That means Donovan's part took 80 minutes divided by 2, which is 40 minutes.

Betsy's part was 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.


58 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

* The cast costs $200.
* The doctor charges $300 an hour, and she was there for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So that's $300 / 2 = $150.
* The pills are $4 each, and she got 30, so that's $4 x 30 = $120.
* Parking is $6 an hour, and she had to park for 2 hours, so that's $6 x 2 = $12.

Now, let's add it all up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

"
"Okay, so James gets a ton of emails!  

First, we gotta figure out how many emails he *doesn't* have to answer. That's 20% of 80, which is like 20 out of every 100. So 80 times 0.20 equals 16 emails.

That means he has to answer 80 minus 16, which is 64 emails each day.

Over a whole work week, that's 64 times 5, which equals 320 emails.


320 

"
"Okay, so they had a lot of classes visit! Let's see...

* Tuesday had twice as many as Monday, so that's 32 x 2 = 64 classes.
* Wednesday had three times as many as Monday, so that's 32 x 3 = 96 classes.
*  Now we add them all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes

"Okay, so John got 100 three times and then an 80. To find the average, you add up all his scores and then divide by how many tests he took.

So, 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Then, 380 divided by 4 is 95.


95 

"
"Okay, so the glee club ate a lot of pizza! They ate 70% of their 20 pizzas, which is 14 pizzas (20 x 0.70 = 14). That means they had 6 left over (20 - 14 = 6).

The football team got twice as many pizzas, so they had 40 pizzas (20 x 2 = 40). They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas (40 x 0.80 = 32).  They had 8 left over (40 - 32 = 8).

So, in total, there are 14 pizzas left (6 + 8 = 14).

"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out a lot of coupons! He's sending out double the big coupons compared to the small ones, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The small coupons cost 5 cents each, so those will cost 700 * $0.05 = $35.00 to mail.

The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so mailing those will cost 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.

To find the total cost, we add those together: $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00


$245.00 

"
"Okay, so Sidney started with 7 meatball subs, which is 7 times 4 meatballs, so that's 28 meatballs. Then Mark ate some, leaving Sidney with 3 subs, which is 3 times 4 meatballs, or 12 meatballs. Sidney got 3 more subs, so now he has 6 subs total. That's 6 times 4 meatballs, which is 24 meatballs.  Adding the meatballs he already had, Sidney has 12 + 24 = 36 meatballs.


36 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each one had 20 tons of fertilizer. That's a lot of fertilizer!  But then 5 of the trucks broke down.  So, 15 trucks made it to the farmers.  

If each truck had 20 tons, then 15 trucks would have 15 * 20 = 300 tons of fertilizer.


300 

"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for each dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

The store has a deal where if you buy one pound, you get another half off.  So, for every two pounds he buys, he only pays for one and a half.

Since he needs 6 pounds, he'll buy 3 full-priced pounds and get 3 half-priced pounds.

Three pounds at $4.00 each is $12.00.

Three half-priced pounds are like paying $2.00 each, so that's $6.00.

In total, the butter will cost him $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00. 


$18.00
"
"Okay, so Kayla invited a bunch of people! Let's see... 25 classmates plus 7 dance friends plus 13 family members is 45 people. But 4 can't make it, so that leaves 41 people coming.

The theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and then $6 for each extra person.  So, 41 minus 20 is 21 extra people. That's 21 times $6, which is $126.

Adding that to the $125 base price, the party will cost $251.


251 

"
"Okay, so Maggie and Riza both started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter of hers, which is like $60 divided by 4, so she spent $15. That means she has $45 left. Riza spent a third of hers, which is $60 divided by 3, so she spent $20. She has $40 left.  If you add their leftover money, $45 plus $40, they have $85 left together.


85 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for the whole week.  That means each day he has 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas a day, and the second eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.

Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.

That means the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas each day.


21 

"
"Okay, so Teddy did half of the first puzzle, which is 500 divided by 2, that's 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other puzzle, so that's another 500 pieces.  In total, he put together 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.


750 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses, which is one group of 12 and then 3 more.  A dozen roses costs $15, and 3 roses cost $6 (3 x $2 = $6). So the roses cost $21 in total.

Jenny has $25 because she has five $5 bills.  That means she gets $4 back ($25 - $21 = $4).

Since quarters are worth 25 cents, she gets 16 quarters back ($4 / $0.25 = 16).


16 

"
"Okay, so Terry sells a bunch of stuff:

* Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes times $5.50 each is $33.00
* Burger Platters: 9 platters times $11 each is $99.00
* Sodas: 20 sodas times $1.50 each is $30.00

If you add all that up, he makes $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.00


162.00 

"
"Okay, so Paul has to wait for the fourth train.  

* The first train comes in 10 minutes and hangs out for 20 minutes.
* The second train gets there 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes. It only stays for 5 minutes though.
* The third train comes an hour after the second one leaves, so that's 60 + 60 = 120 minutes. It leaves right away.
* The fourth train, the one Paul wants, comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so that's 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

So Paul has to wait for 140 minutes. 

140 

"
"Okay, so Melanie needs 200 toothpicks. She already has 120, which means she needs 80 more. Since she saves 10 each week, it will take her 8 more weeks to get enough.

"
"Okay, so the watch originally cost $2000. Mr. Rogers got it for 75% of that, which is like getting 75 cents for every dollar.

So he paid 0.75 * $2000 = $1500.

Then he sold it for 120% of what he paid, which is like getting $1.20 for every dollar he paid.

That means his friend paid 1.20 * $1500 = $1800.

To find the discount, we subtract what his friend paid from the original price: $2000 - $1800 = $200.

Finally, to find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so each spring makes a jellyfish every second.  That's 60 jellyfish a minute, and 3600 jellyfish in an hour!

If we have 5 springs, they'd make 5 times that many, so 18,000 jellyfish every hour.

In 4 hours, that's 18,000 times 4, which is 72,000 jellyfish!


72000 

"
"Okay, so Binkie scored 90. Frankie scored twice that amount plus 15 more points.  

Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.

Then add 15: 180 + 15 = 195

Frankie scored 195. 


195
"
"Okay, so James walks 4 miles to the store, but he has to walk back home halfway there. That means he walked 2 miles to the halfway point. Then he walks 2 miles back home and 2 miles to the store again.

So, he walked a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 miles.

If he walks 4 miles every hour, it takes him 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours to get to the store.


1.5 

"
"Okay, so Jenny bought a lot of bananas!  

She got 10 bunches, and each bunch has 4 bananas, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 bananas.

If she bought them one by one, it would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

But she got the bunches for $3.00 each, so that's 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence to split. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  

Let's see... if we take away the extra 60 feet Harry gets, they would have 100 - 60 = 40 feet to split evenly.

That means Sam would get 40 / 2 = 20 feet.


20 

"
"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  That means it grows 2 inches each year (8 divided by 4 is 2).

If it grows 2 inches a year, in 13 years it will grow 26 inches (2 times 13 is 26).


26 

"
"Okay, so Marcel sold a bunch of bikes! Let's see how much money he made.

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes, and those are half the price of an MTB, which costs $500. So a BMX bike costs $500 / 2 = $250.  That means he made 45 * $250 = $11,250 from BMX bikes.
* He sold the rest of the bikes, which were MTBs. That's 300 total bikes - 150 Trekking bikes - 45 BMX bikes = 105 MTB bikes. He made 105 * $500 = $52,500 from those.

Now, let's add up all the money: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


$131,250
"
"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 times 6 which is 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales every hour for 6 hours, so that's 3 times 6 which is 18 bales.  If you take the bales the farmer made and take away the bales the truck picked up, you get 30 minus 18 which is 12 bales.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has 8 classes a day because he has 2 extra. That's 8 times 40 minutes, which is 320 minutes of class each day.  

He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 320 times 5, which is 1600 minutes.

On the weekend, he studies for 100 minutes each day, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 minutes.

In total, he studies 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he studies 1800 / 60 = 30 hours a week.


30 

"
"Okay, so the ball starts on the third floor, which is 3 times 24 feet high, so that's 72 feet.

Then it bounces up to 2/3 of that, which is like cutting 72 in half and then in half again.  That's 48 feet.

The second bounce is 2/3 of 48 feet.  Cutting 48 in half is 24, and cutting that in half is 12.  So the second bounce is 32 feet!


**Answer:** 32 

"
"Okay, so the first kid is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches. The second kid is 2 inches taller, so they're 74 inches. The third kid is 5 inches shorter than that, so they're 69 inches.  The fourth kid is 3 inches taller than the third, so they're 72 inches tall.


72 

"
"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples.  That means they sold 2000 / 10 = 200 bags.

If each bag costs $5, then they made 200 * $5 = $1000.


$1000 

"
"Okay, so the Allosaurus ate what was left, which was 270 kilograms. That means before they got there, there was double that, right? So 270 times 2 is 540 kilograms.

But that was after the velociraptors ate half!  So before they showed up, there must have been double again.  540 times 2 is 1080 kilograms.

So the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat on it.


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to figure out how much paint he needs.  

First, let's find out how big each of the long walls are: 10 feet times 8 feet is 80 square feet. Since there are two of those walls, that's 80 times 2, which is 160 square feet.

The shorter walls are 5 feet times 8 feet, which is 40 square feet each.  With two of those, it's 40 times 2, or 80 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the walls: 160 square feet plus 80 square feet is 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so he needs 240 divided by 20, which is 12 gallons.

If each gallon costs $12, then 12 gallons will cost 12 times $12, which is $144.


$144 

"
"Okay, so Ellen left 2 sodas that were shaken out of 8 total.  That means her friend has a 2 out of 8 chance of getting a shaken one.  To make that a percentage, you do (2 divided by 8) times 100, which is 25%.


25 

"
"Okay, so the fast train goes 60 miles every hour, and the slow train goes 30 miles every hour because it's half as fast.  

If they both go for 3 hours, the fast train will have gone 60 x 3 = 180 miles.

The slow train will have gone 30 x 3 = 90 miles.

To find out how far apart they are, we add those distances together: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours each day. That means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people every day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days.

He takes 20% of those days off, so he takes 50 * 0.20 = 10 days off.

That means he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

So, in total, he helps 40 * 6 = 240 people.


240 

"
"Okay, so there were 12 buses and each one had 35 people, so that's 12 times 35 which is 420 people. Then there were 20 cars with 3 people in each, so that's 20 times 3 which is 60 people.  

If you add those together, 420 plus 60, you get 480 people.


480 

"
"Okay, so Mike is 24. Martha is 4 years younger than him, so she's 20. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30.


30 

"
"Okay, so the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet every minute.  That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to go down.

The smaller slide is 240 feet and you go 80 feet per minute, so it takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

That means the big slide takes 5 - 3 = 2 minutes longer. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a half-hour lunch every day, and two 15-minute breaks, which is another 30 minutes. That's a total of 60 minutes of breaks each day.

Over 5 days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes of breaks.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300 / 60 = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times that, so he ran 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.  Together they ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.


16 

"
"Okay, so Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. Then she returned something for $15.00, so she had $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00 left.

The frying pan was on sale for 20% off, so that's $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00 off.  So the pan cost $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The towels were 10% off, so that's $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00 off. The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

She spent $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00 on the new stuff.

So her new balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00


$113.00
"
"Okay, so a fifth of the jellyfish are big, and a third of those big ones change color. That means 6 jellyfish changing color is like a third of the big jellyfish.  So there must be 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

If 18 jellyfish are a fifth of all the jellyfish, then there are 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in total.


90 

"
"Okay, so Chris is 4. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 8.  Caroline is three times older than Ben, so she's 24.


24 

"
"Okay, so Lauren wants to save up enough money to live on for 20 years after she retires.  She wants to spend $40,000 each year during retirement. That means she needs to save up $40,000 x 20 = $800,000.

She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year, which is $100,000 x 0.20 = $20,000.

To save up $800,000, it will take her $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.


40 

"
"Okay, so Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He cuts it into 4 equal pieces, so each piece is 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long.

Then he cuts each of those pieces into 5 smaller pieces. So each tiny piece is 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.


5 

"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school is like 100%.  To find out how many kids are in the whole school, we can think of it like this:

If 40% is 240 kids, then 10% is 240 / 4 = 60 kids.

That means 100% is 60 x 10 = 600 kids.

If there are 600 kids total and 240 are boys, then there must be 600 - 240 = 360 girls.


360 

"
"Okay, so my mom spent $19 on pots and $26 on soil, so that's $19 + $26 = $45.  But she had a coupon for $7 off, so she only paid $45 - $7 = $38.


$38 

"
"Okay, so there are six women in total. Three have 4-inch heels and three have 2-inch heels.  To find the average, we add up all the heel heights and divide by the number of women.

So, it's (4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3

"
"Okay, so Soledad wants to hike a ton of miles! She wants to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days.  

If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 125 x 2 = 250 miles each day.

In a whole month, she'd hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

That's not enough! She needs to hike 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 more miles.

To get those extra miles in, she needs to hike 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 more miles each day.


60 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 red balls at $9 each, that's 3 times 9, which is 27 bucks. Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's 11 times 5, which is 55 dollars.  And lastly, 25 green balls at $3 each, so 25 times 3 is 75 dollars.

If you add all that up, 27 plus 55 plus 75, they'll make $157 when they sell all the balls.


157 

"
"Okay, so they have 12 kg of apples. Peter takes a quarter, which is 12 divided by 4, so he gets 3 kg. Paul takes a third, which is 12 divided by 3, so he gets 4 kg.  Together they take 3 + 4 = 7 kg. That leaves 12 - 7 = 5 kg for James.


5 

"
"Okay, so it started at 2 degrees. Then it got colder by 8 degrees, so that's 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  But then it warmed up a bit by 3 degrees, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.

"
"Okay, so Raymond starts with $21. Then he gets $11 more, so now he has $21 + $11 = $32.  

He spends $5 on a comic, so he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.

Then he buys a puzzle for $19, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.


$8 

"
"Okay, so Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12.  Then she had $2 left, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on books.

Since she bought 2 books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5.


$5 

"
"Okay, so last year there were 50 students. This year there were 20% more students.  To find out how many more students there are, we can do 50 times 0.20, which is 10.  So there are 10 more students this year.  That means there are 50 + 10 = 60 students this year.


60 

"
"Okay, so the lighthouse blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. That means it blinks 51 times every minute (255 divided by 5).  To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51, which equals 9. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Tate starts with more girl fish than boy fish.  Then he buys more girl fish. Let's see...

* He starts with 7 boy fish and 12 girl fish.
* He buys 2 more boy fish and 4 more girl fish.
* That means he has 9 boy fish (7 + 2) and 16 girl fish (12 + 4).

He has 7 more girl fish than boy fish (16 - 9 = 7).


**Answer:** 7 

"
"Okay, so Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than that, so she walked the dog for 4 + 2 = 6 hours. Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, so she did laundry for 4 + 4 = 8 hours.  

To find the total time, we add up all the times: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.


18 

"
"Okay, so John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents. That means it's 70 x 2 = 140 miles each way.

Since he has to drive back home, that's 140 x 2 = 280 miles for one trip.

He does this twice a month, so he drives 280 x 2 = 560 miles every month.


560 

"
"Okay, so Sofie walks 10 miles each day for 7 days, that's 10 x 7 = 70 miles.

Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles.


35 

"
"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys, right?  

Let's see... two workers make 6 toys each hour, so that's 2 times 6 equals 12 toys every hour. They work for 10 hours, so that's 12 times 10 equals 120 toys.

Then there are two more workers who make 4 toys an hour, so that's 2 times 4 equals 8 toys an hour. Over 10 hours, they make 8 times 10 equals 80 toys.

So those four workers made 120 plus 80 equals 200 toys.

They need 20 more toys to finish the order, so that means the last worker made 400 minus 20 minus 200 equals 180 toys.

That means the last worker made 180 toys in 10 hours, so he makes 180 divided by 10 equals 18 toys every hour.


18 

"
"Okay, so Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth that weight, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds together.  

All the dogs together weigh 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Okay, so Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 more, so that means Kris had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers before giving some to Rob.

That means Luis gave Kris 16 stickers, and that was only half of what Luis had! So Luis had 16 x 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis got half his stickers from Seth, so Seth must have had 32 x 2 = 64 stickers at the beginning.


64 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 bags of M&Ms and each bag weighs 10 ounces. That's 3 times 10, which is 30 ounces total.

Each ounce has 30 M&Ms, so he has 30 times 30, which is 900 M&Ms.

If he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 900 divided by 10, which is 90 small bags.


90 

"
"Okay, so Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  Halfway around the Earth is like half the Earth's size, which is 40,000 kilometers divided by 2, that's 20,000 kilometers.

To find out how many days it takes Alfie, we divide the total distance by how far he flies each day: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.


50 

"
"Wow, 1.25 times faster? That's super fast!

So the second fastest car goes 5 times faster than a normal car, which is 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph.

And the fastest car is even crazier, 1.25 times faster than that, so it goes 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph!


750 

"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, but two years ago he was 14.  That means Vince was 7 two years ago because 14 divided by 2 is 7.  So now Vince is 9 years old.


9 

"
"Okay, so Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Sarah must have painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9).  That means Camden painted 21 eggs (9 + 12 = 21).

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest of the eggs, which is 26 (56 - 30 = 26). They each painted the same amount, so Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).


8 

"
"Okay, so Nik has a lot of crayons!  

He's got 200 crayons and wants to put 8 in each box. That means he needs 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so all the boxes together weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too, since each one is 1 ounce.

That's a total of 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.

"Okay, so the tree is 80 feet tall, but he can only use 80% of it, which is 64 feet.  Then he makes logs that are 4 feet long, so he gets 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  Each log makes 5 planks, so that's 16 * 5 = 80 planks.  If he sells each plank for $1.20, he makes 80 * $1.20 = $96.

"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month. Her brother makes double that, which is $5000 x 2 = $10000.

Together they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mom makes twice that, so she makes $15000 x 2 = $30000.

To find out how much they all make together, we add it all up: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000


45000 

"
"Okay, so Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and it takes her 40 minutes. That means she walks at 3 miles per hour on the beach (because 2 miles divided by 40 minutes is like 2 miles divided by 2/3 of an hour, which is 3 miles per hour).

On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast, so she goes 6 miles per hour. Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 10 minutes (because 1 mile divided by 6 miles per hour is 1/6 of an hour, and 1/6 of an hour times 60 minutes per hour is 10 minutes).

So, her whole walk takes 40 minutes (beach) + 10 minutes (sidewalk) = 50 minutes.

"
"Okay, so Jane has $32 saved up already. She wants to have $60. That means she needs $28 more.

Since she saves $4 each week, it will take her 7 more weeks to save up enough.

"
"Okay, so there are three trees with 7 birds each, that's 3 times 7 which is 21 birds. Then there are two trees with 4 birds each, so that's 2 times 4 which equals 8 birds. And lastly, one tree has 3 birds.  

If we add all those up, 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 birds.


32 

"
"Okay, so Bob gets 24 more marbles because 2 dozen is 2 times 12, which is 24.  That means he had 36 marbles before (60 - 24 = 36). If he loses 10, he'll have 26 left (36 - 10 = 26).


26
"
"Okay, so Donny needs his water to be at least 40 degrees.  He's got one mug that's only 33 degrees, so the other mug has to be pretty warm to make up for it.

He puts 4 ounces from the cold mug into his bottle, and 1 ounce from the hot mug. That means the hot mug is gonna have a bigger impact on the final temperature.

Since the mix has to be at least 40 degrees, the hot mug has to be way warmer than that to make up for the cold water. I'd say the hot mug has to be at least 68 degrees. 


68
"
"Okay, so he starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows a day for three weeks, that's 20 * 7 * 3 = 420 cows!

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens a day for three weeks, so that's 10 * 7 * 3 = 210 chickens.

So now he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

That means he has a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals.


700 

"
"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. That means he spends 4 times $10.00, which is $40.00.

But wait, there's a discount! It's 10% off, so we need to figure out what 10% of $40.00 is.  That's $4.00.

So, the bagels cost $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00 after the discount.

He gets 9 bagels in each pack, and he bought 4 packs, so he has 9 times 4 = 36 bagels.

To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total price by the number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.


$1.00 

"
"Okay, so Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, which is 18 scoops.  

It takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops, so one scoop needs 1.5 potatoes.

If Gomer ate 18 scoops, he ate 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.


27 

"
"Okay, so Chester eats a lot of eggs! 

First, he eats 3 eggs a day for a whole month, that's 30 days. So that's 3 times 30 which is 90 eggs.

Then he eats even more, 5 eggs a day for another month. That's 5 times 30, which is 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 plus 150, so 240 eggs in those two months.

Now, a dozen has 12 eggs, right? So we divide 240 by 12, and that gives us 20.


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jelly beans and double that amount of red ones, which is 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans together.

If there are 60 jelly beans total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.


9 

"
"Okay, so Tim has 5 trees and each one gives him 6 lemons every year. That means he gets 5 times 6 lemons, which is 30 lemons every year.

A decade is 10 years, so he gets 30 lemons a year times 10 years, which is 300 lemons!


300 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 men for every 9 women on the bus. That means there are 5 + 9 = 14 parts in total.

If there are 84 people on the bus, then each part has 84 / 14 = 6 people.

There were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 * 6 = 54 women on the bus at first.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.


Answer: 34 

"
"Okay, so Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

He makes $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets every day. That's a total of $26 + $56 = $82 each day.

Since each sunflower in a bouquet is worth $8 / 12 = $0.67, he makes $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 for each sunflower he sells.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

To find out how many sunflowers he sold, we divide his total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower: $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = about 30.7 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold about **30** sunflowers. 

30 

"
"Okay, so Adam starts with $100. He buys rocks for $5 each, so he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

He sells 60% of them, which is 20 * 0.60 = 12 rocks.

If he sells each rock for $7, he makes 12 * $7 = $84.

Since he spent $100 and only made $84, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.


$16 

"
"Okay, so Lauren has a lot of pictures to draw! 

Let's see... for the big pictures, she needs 9 days because 45 scenes divided by 5 scenes a day is 9.  The medium ones take 6 days (36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days). And the small ones take 7 days (49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days).

If we add all those days up, it's 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days.

"
"Okay, so Chatty has 36 eggs (cause 3 dozen is 3 times 12).  She has 4 kids, so if she splits them evenly, each kid gets 9 eggs.

"
"Okay, so Jen has 3 fish and each one needs $1 of food every day.  That means she spends 3 x $1 = $3 each day on fish food.

May has 31 days, so she spends $3 x 31 = $93 on fish food for the whole month.

"
"Okay, so Patricia starts with 30 roses, but gives 24 to her mom. That leaves her with 30 - 24 = 6 roses. Then she buys 15 more, so she has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.

"
"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  That means he traveled a total of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.

He was driving for a total of 2 + 3 = 5 hours.

To find his average speed, we do 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so Mark's first ticket has a 20% chance of winning.  His second ticket is three times more likely to win, so that's 20 times 3 which is 60%. To figure out the chance of BOTH tickets winning, we multiply the chances together: 20% times 60% equals 12%.


12% 

"
"Okay, so Jim has 27 seashells. Carlos has 5 less than Jim, so he has 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carrey has half as many as Carlos, so he has 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

To find out how many each person gets, we add up all the seashells: 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. Then we divide that by 3 because there are 3 people: 60 / 3 = 20 seashells each.


20 

"
"Okay, so Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday, that's 4 times 5 which is 20 carrots. Then on the weekend he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 times 2 which is 10 carrots.  

In total, he eats 20 plus 10 carrots, which is 30 carrots a week.


30 

"
"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes.  That means it's 5 times 0.60, or 3 minutes longer. So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

That means the whole cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes long.


13 

"
"Okay, so Linus buys each phone for $20 and sells them for $40, which means he makes $20 profit on each one.

He bought 2 phones on Monday, so he made $20/phone * 2 phones = $40.

On Tuesday, he bought 4 phones and made $20/phone * 4 phones = $80.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120.


120 

"
"Okay, so Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall.  Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 6 divided by 2, which is 3 feet long.

"
"Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles of juice each day. Each bottle gives you 20% of the energy you need for the whole day.  

We need to figure out how much more juice they need to make so that 2300 people get all the energy they need.

First, let's see how much energy 2300 people need in total. That's 2300 people * 100% energy each = 230,000% energy.

Now, let's see how much energy the juice they make now gives us: 4200 bottles * 20% energy per bottle = 84,000% energy.

To find out how much more energy they need, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000% energy.

Finally, to see how many more bottles they need, we divide the extra energy needed by the energy in each bottle: 146,000% / 20% per bottle = 7300 bottles.



**Answer:** 7300 

"
"Okay, so Carla has 8 babies, and 6 of them wear purple.  Two of the purple babies and both of the blue babies wear bows. That means 4 babies have bows in total.

Since 2 of the babies with bows are wearing purple, there's a 50% chance a baby with a bow is wearing purple.

"
"Okay, so they got a bunch of reports last week, right?  They got 1907 on Monday and Tuesday, and then 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  That's a total of 1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports for those four days.

If they got 5168 reports all week, then they got 5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports on Wednesday.

"
"Okay, so Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it first, which is 80 divided by 2, so that's 40 square meters. He gets $50 for that.

Then he sells another chunk, which is a quarter of what he had left.  That's 40 divided by 4, so 10 square meters. He gets $30 for that.

Now he only has 30 square meters left. He sells that for $3 per square meter, so that's 30 times 3, which is $90.

To find out how much he made in total, we add up all the money: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.


$170 

"
"Okay, so Haley is 26. Half of Haley's age is 26 divided by 2, which is 13. Geb is 10 years younger than that, so he's 13 minus 10, which is 3 years old.

"
"Okay, so Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. That means he uses 2 * 3 = 6 masks every day.

Over two days, he'd use 6 * 2 = 12 masks.

"
"Okay, so Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 times 12, or 36 eggs.  Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that, so she found 5 times 2, which is 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Let's add up how many they found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden.

"
"Okay, so John has a lot of apartments to collect from! 

The first two places have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The last place is bigger, like 60% bigger than those two put together.  So, it's 400 times 0.60, which is 240 more apartments.

That means the last place has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He goes to each place three times a week, so that's 1440 times 3 = 4320 times he collects garbage.

He gets 40 cents for each time he collects, so he makes 4320 times $0.40 = $1728.00 every week.


$1728.00
"
"Okay, so the avocado tree starts with 50 fruits. Then it goes up to 150, then 350, and then it gets tricky.  

The 8-year-old tree makes less than the 10-year-old, by 200 fruits. The 10-year-old makes 20 times the original 50, so that's 1000 fruits! So the 8-year-old makes 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

The 9-year-old makes nothing, and the 10-year-old makes 1000.

Adding it all up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits

"
"Okay, so the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  And all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  

Let's see... if we think of the blue rope as 'b', the yellow rope is 'b + 7' and the red rope is '4b'.

If we add them all up, it's b + (b + 7) + 4b = 37

That means 6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides, so 6b = 30

Then divide both sides by 6, and we get b = 5.

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is 4 times the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.


20 

"
"Okay, so Rissa got three times more than Ronnie, which is 3 * $5 = $15.

Rissa gave some money to her sister, and now she has 4/5 of what she started with. That means she gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 * (1/5) = $3.

Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister.  So, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.


**Answer:** 2 

"
"Okay, so half the mural is yellow, which means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're all used the same amount, each color got 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"
"Okay, so Tom has four bedrooms, and each one is 20 feet by 12 feet.  That means each bedroom is 20 times 12, which is 240 square feet.  

All the bedrooms together are 240 times 4, so that's 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.

So the bedrooms and living room together are 960 plus 1200, which is 2160 square feet.

Don't forget the rest of the house is 1000 square feet, so the whole house is 2160 plus 1000, which is 3160 square feet.

"Okay, so Alice starts with 3 clouds on Monday. Then each day she sees double the clouds from the day before.

* Tuesday: 3 x 2 = 6 clouds
* Wednesday: 6 x 2 = 12 clouds
* Thursday: 12 x 2 = 24 clouds
* Friday: 24 x 2 = 48 clouds

To find the total, we add up all the clouds: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds


93 

"
"Okay, so the big box has 20 more pods than the regular one, which is like 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

Since the big box still costs $12, that means you get 120 pods for $12.  To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, you divide 120 by 12, which is 10.


10 

"
"Okay, so Thomas starts with $1000, and since each bill is $20, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Then he loses 10, so he has 50 - 10 = 40 left.

He uses half for a bill, so he uses 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

That leaves him with 40 - 20 = 20 bills.

If he triples his money, he has 20 * 3 = 60 bills worth $20 each.

That's 60 * $20 = $1200 total.

Finally, he changes them all to $5 bills, so he has $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.


**Answer:** 240 

"
"Okay, so Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and Team B scored 2 less than that, so they got 2 goals.  Then in the second half, Team B scored 4 times the amount from the first half, which is 2 times 4 = 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of that, so they got 8 divided by 4 = 2 goals.

That means Team A scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

All together, there were 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the game.

"
"Okay, so the teacher started with 5 inches of chalk and used 45% of it, which is like 2.25 inches (5 x 0.45 = 2.25). That means he has 2.75 inches left (5 - 2.25 = 2.75).

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is like 1 inch out of 5 (5 x 0.20 = 1).  So, he can use the rest of the chalk for 2 more days (2.75 / 1 = 2.75, but he can't use it for part of a day).

2 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 girls and 12 boys, that's 24 kids in total.  One-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 girls. And one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 / 4 = 3 boys.  

That means 4 + 3 = 7 kids are on varsity.  

So, 24 - 7 = 17 kids are not on varsity.

"Okay, so the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 teeth (because 4 + 7 = 11). That means the dentist fixed 4 + 11 = 15 teeth in total.

To find the percentage, we do (15 teeth fixed / 30 total teeth) * 100% which equals 50%.


50 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought a bunch of milk, right?  He got 4000 gallons, and each gallon cost $3.50. That means he spent 4000 * $3.50 = $14,000 on milk.

But then, yuck, 2 out of every 5 gallons went bad! That's 1600 gallons of spoiled milk.  Since each gallon cost $3.50, the bad milk was worth 1600 * $3.50 = $5600.

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back.

"Okay, so Wendy is way older than Colin right now.  In seven years, Colin will be older, and Wendy will be even older than that.  

It says in 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age *now*. That's a big difference!  

Let's see... if Colin is a third of Wendy's age in 25 years, then Wendy must be a lot older now.  

Hmm... I think Colin is 20 now.  That seems to make sense with the clues.

"
"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. That means each school gets $9,000 ($27,000 / 3 = $9,000).

He can buy 100 books for $500, so each book costs $5 ($500 / 100 = $5).

If each school has $9,000, he can buy 1800 books for each school ($9,000 / $5 = 1800).


1800 

"
"Okay, so there were 2 apples at first. Then 5 more fell, so that's 2 + 5 = 7 apples. He kept one and threw one back up, so there were 6 in his pocket. Then 6 more fell, so now there are 6 + 1 + 6 = 13 apples!

"
"Okay, so Ali needs 850 kilos of coal. Each bag has 50 kilos, so he needs 850 / 50 = 17 bags.

$306 

"
"Okay, so Kate's friends eat a lot of pizza!  Let's see... they eat 6 slices of cheese each and there are 12 slices in a cheese pizza, so she needs 6 friends * 6 slices = 36 slices of cheese pizza. That means she needs 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.

For pepperoni, they eat 4 slices each and each pizza has 8 slices, so she needs 6 friends * 4 slices = 24 slices of pepperoni. That's 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.

In total, she needs 3 cheese pizzas + 3 pepperoni pizzas = 6 pizzas.

"
"Okay, so Sam ran 3 miles three times this week, so that's 3 x 3 = 9 miles.

Then he ran 5 miles two times, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 miles.

"
"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs every hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That means every hour, 8 snowballs melt (because there are four 15-minute chunks in an hour).

So, he actually gains 12 snowballs every hour (20 made - 8 melted).

To get 60 snowballs, he needs to gain 40 more (60 - 20 = 40).

If he gains 12 every hour, it will take him 3 and a bit hours to get to 60 (40 / 12 = 3.33 hours).

"Okay, so they used a bunch of bandages and ordered more. Let's see...

* Day 1 they used 38 and got 50 more, so they had 50 - 38 = 12 left over.
* Day 2 they used 28, so they had 12 - 28 = -16.  Wait, that doesn't make sense, they can't have negative bandages!
* Oh, they must have had some from before. Let's say they started with 'x' bandages.
* After day 1 they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages.
* After day 2 they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages.
* Day 3 they used 25 and got 100 more, so they had x - 16 - 25 + 100 = x + 59 bandages.
* They ended with 78, so x + 59 = 78
* That means they started with x = 78 - 59 = 19 bandages!

"
"Okay, so May's haircut cost $30 per inch and she got 2 inches cut off (10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches).  That means the haircut cost $60 (2 inches * $30/inch = $60).

100 

"
"Okay, so Jen works a lot! Let's see... she works 7 and a half hours each day, and she gets paid $1.50 for every hour.  That means she makes 7.5 times 1.5 which is $11.25 each day.

She works 6 days a week, so she makes $11.25 times 6 which is $67.50 every week.

April has 4 weeks, so she makes $67.50 times 4 which is $270 for the whole month.

Oh, and she gets an extra $10 for coming to work every day, so we add that to her total.

That means she makes $270 + $10 = $280 for the whole month!

* He took out the trash twice and gets $0.75 each time, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
* He cleaned his room once and gets $1.50 for that.

Now let's add it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00


$9.00

"Wow, that's a lot of blood! So a shark has three times the blood of a whale, which is 40 gallons times 3, that's 120 gallons!  If there are ten sharks, we multiply that by 10, so 120 times 10 equals 1200 gallons.


1200 

"
"Okay, so there were 50 people at first. Then 40 more came, so that's 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then twice the number who came at 10:00 came in, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 more people. Now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, three times the first group came, so that's 50 * 3 = 150 more people.  

In total, there were 170 + 150 = 320 people at the restaurant.

"
"Alain has 10 packs of black pens because he has twice as many black pens as red pens. That's 15 packs in total (5 red + 10 black). Since each pack has 5 pens, he has 75 pens altogether (15 packs * 5 pens/pack).


75 

"
"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600, which means each bottle costs $60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.

Cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90.

So the cognac costs 20 * $90 = $1800.

In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.


$2400
"
"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day and 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

That means he planted a total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"
"Okay, so Fred started with 24 gallons of root beer. His kids drank 4 gallons, so there were 20 left. Then his wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 13.  His friend drank 5 gallons, so there were only 8 gallons left for the party. Since there were 4 people at the party, they each got 8 divided by 4, which is 2 gallons.

"
"Okay, so it says ""eight more than four times"" the number of mugs is 40.  That means we need to do some math!

Let's say there are 'x' mugs.

Four times the mugs is 4x.

Eight more than that is 4x + 8.

And we know that equals 40.

So, 4x + 8 = 40

Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32

Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

There are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. 

"
"Okay, so there are 66 fish total. One-third of them have red stripes, so that's 66 divided by 3, which is 22 fish.  

That means 66 minus 22 equals 44 fish don't have red stripes.

Then, 5 out of every 11 of those fish have blue stripes. So, we do 44 times 5 divided by 11, which is 20 fish.

Finally, we add the red stripe fish and the blue stripe fish: 22 plus 20 equals 42 fish.


42 

"
"Okay, so Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, and each has four colors, so that's 2 times 4 equals 8 colors. Then she has three makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 times 6 equals 18 colors.  

That means she has 8 plus 18 equals 26 colors in total.

But her sister takes one of the palettes, which is 4 colors, so now she has 26 minus 4 equals 22 colors.

Then she uses half the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 divided by 2 equals 3 colors.

So, she has 22 minus 3 equals 19 colors left.


19 

"
"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times taller than him, which is 60 x 7 = 420 inches.

The first floor is 3 times his height, so that's 60 x 3 = 180 inches.

If we add his height and the first floor height, we get 60 + 180 = 240 inches.

That means the second floor is 420 - 240 = 180 inches tall.


180 

"
"Okay, so the Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280 shells (700 x 0.40 = 280).  That leaves 420 shells (700 - 280 = 420).

The Finders got 60% of those leftover shells, so they found 252 shells (420 x 0.60 = 252).

That means the Gogetters found the rest, which is 168 shells (420 - 252 = 168).


168 

"
"Okay, so Bernie has four dogs and they need to walk a total of 12 miles.  The first three dogs need to walk 1, 4, and 3 miles, so that's 8 miles total.  That means the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

"
"Okay, so John's house is worth $250,000, and he borrows 40% of that, which is like 40 out of every 100 dollars.  

So, he gets $100,000 from the loan (250,000 x 0.40 = 100,000).

Then he uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. That's like 60 out of every 100 dollars of the loan.

So, he uses $60,000 to pay off debt (100,000 x 0.60 = 60,000).

That means he has $40,000 left over (100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000).


$40,000
"
"Okay, so Deandre caught three tunas.  They weighed 56, 46, and 26 kilograms. That's a lot of tuna!

To find out how much he'll make, we gotta add up the weights: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.

Each kilogram of tuna sells for 50 cents, so we multiply: 128 x $0.50 = $64.00

He'll earn $64.00 selling all the tuna.


$64.00
"
"Okay, so Trinity bought the magazines for $72.  She sells them for 11/8 times that amount.  To find out how much she sells them for, we multiply: $72 * (11/8) = $99.

To find her profit, we subtract what she paid from what she earned: $99 - $72 = $27.

So her profit is $27. 


$27
"
"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier takes out water from the air.  

On low, it takes out 1 liter each day. He used it on low for 3 days, so that's 1 x 3 = 3 liters.

On medium, it takes out twice as much as low, so that's 1 x 2 = 2 liters per day. He used it on medium for 3 days, so that's 2 x 3 = 6 liters.

On high, it takes out twice as much as medium, so that's 2 x 2 = 4 liters per day. He used it on high for 5 days, so that's 4 x 5 = 20 liters.

To find the total, we add up all the liters: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.


29 

"
"Okay, so they had 10 packs of balloons with 30 in each pack, so that's 10 times 30 which is 300 balloons. Then they had 12 left over, so they must have thrown 300 minus 12, which is 288 balloons.


288 

"
"Okay, so Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine and three times that amount of the second one, which is 14 * 3 = 42 mL.

That means each dose has 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL total.

If she needs 8 doses, she'll need 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.


448 

"
"Okay, so Ali's class can hold 120 students. John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's, so each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, they can hold a total of 15 * 2 = 30 students.  

To find the total capacity of both schools, we add the number of students each school can hold: 120 + 30 = 150 students.


150 

"
"Okay, so Stephen borrowed $300 and has to pay back 2% extra. That's like $300 x 0.02 = $6 extra.

So, he owes a total of $300 + $6 = $306.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, so that's $25 x 11 = $275.

To find out how much he pays in the last month, we subtract what he already paid: $306 - $275 = $31.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Jordan has two kids who need diaper changes.  Each kid needs 5 changes a day, so that's 2 kids times 5 changes, which is 10 changes total. His wife does half, so she does 10 divided by 2, which is 5 changes. That means Jordan does the other 5 changes.


5 

"
"Okay, so the jar is like a box, right?  It's 6 by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall.  To find out how much space is inside, we multiply those numbers together: 6 times 6 times 15 equals 540.

But jelly beans don't fit perfectly together, so there's gonna be some empty space.  He said they only use about 80% of the space, so we multiply 540 by 0.80, which is 432.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15 to see how many jelly beans fit: 432 divided by 0.15 is 2880.

He thinks 30% are red, so we multiply 2880 by 0.30, which is 864.

But there are actually 900 red jelly beans, so he was off by 900 minus 864, which is 36. 


**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

Then at the next stop, 3/4 of those 40 people get on, which is 30 people. So now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.


20 

"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 each time. That's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.

Over 5 years, she spends $6 * 5 = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 * 1.5 = $3 to the price.

So now each visit costs $2 + $3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5 * 3 * 3 = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75.


75 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 kids from each grade that get to try the escape room, and there are 4 grades. That's 10 times 4, which is 40 kids total.

But the escape room can only fit 8 kids at a time. So, 40 kids divided by 8 kids per group is 5 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 5 groups times 45 minutes, which is 225 minutes. 

**225** 

"
"Okay, so John made 4 tables and each one cost $20. That's 4 times 20, which is $80. He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each, so that's 2 times 10, which is $20.  To find the total, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

100 

"
"Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces, and the longer piece has to be four times bigger than the shorter one.  

To figure out how long the longer piece is, we can think of it like this:

* Let's say the shorter piece is ""x"" feet long.
* The longer piece is 4 times that, so it's 4x feet long.

Together, the two pieces have to equal the whole board, which is 40 feet. So:

x + 4x = 40

That means 5x = 40

If we divide both sides by 5, we get x = 8.

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long.

The longer piece is 4 times that, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.


32 

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. That means he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of meat.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so he'll need 5 * 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


10 

"
"Okay, so Luke has 5 windows and each one is 35 inches wide.  To find the total width, we multiply: 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.

Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, we multiply again: 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.

Luke needs 350 inches of fabric. 


350
"
"Okay, so the call costs 25 cents a minute for the first 16 minutes. That's 16 times 0.25, which is $4.00.

Then it's 20 cents a minute for the rest of the call. So that's 20 times 0.20, which is $4.00.

Add those together and it's $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so it rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday is supposed to get twice that amount plus one more inch.  So that's 2 times 2 which is 4, and then plus 1 more inch, making a total of 5 inches.


5 

"
"Okay, so Carly needs enough cupcakes and brownies for everyone in her class to have two treats.  That's 5 people times 2 treats each, which is 10 treats total.

She makes way more brownies than cupcakes, like three times more, but then takes away two.  

Let's say she makes 'x' cupcakes.  That means she makes 3x - 2 brownies.

So, the cupcakes plus the brownies have to equal 10: x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combining the 'x's, we get 4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4x = 12

Then, dividing both sides by 4, we find out x = 3.


So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, so together that's $35 + $40 = $75.

But wait, there's a discount! If you get both, it's 20% off.  That means we gotta do 20% of $75, which is $15 off.

So now it's $75 - $15 = $60.

Oh, and she wants nail art on each finger, and that's $3 per nail. She has 10 fingers, so that's $3 x 10 = $30 for the nail art.

Finally, we add the nail art price to the manicure/pedicure price: $60 + $30 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, so Susan gets a lot of magazines! Let's see...

She gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 issues.

Then she has one that sends 6 issues.

And the last one sends 4 times the 6 issue one, so that's 6 times 4, which is 24 issues.

To find the total, we add them all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.


66 

"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings. Shelley has 12 more than that, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Kim has 8 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.


31 

"
"Okay, so the toy cost $40 at first. Then it went up by 80%, which is like adding 80% of $40, which is $32. So in December it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

But then in January it went down by 50%, which is like taking away half of $72, which is $36. So in January it cost $72 - $36 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson.  He has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he takes off $20 from his normal price, so he charges $80 - $20 = $60.

He gives 2 lessons to veterans, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.

To find his total money, we add up the regular lessons and the veteran lessons: $320 + $120 = $440


$440
"
"Okay, so to find Sally's average score, we gotta add up all her quiz scores and then divide by how many quizzes she took.

So, 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Then, 630 divided by 9 quizzes is 70.


70 

"
"Eve started with 20 pomelos and now has 1/4 of that left.  That means she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left.

So, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.


15 

"
"Okay, so Walter started with 60 apples. He ate 24 of them (that's 2/5 of 60).  Then he had 36 left. He gave his sister 9 apples (that's 25% of 36).  That left him with 27 apples. He sold those for $3 each, so he made 27 * $3 = $81.


$81 

"
"Okay, so Regina wrote 9 books last year, and that's only three-quarters of the books she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we can think of it like this:

If 9 books is 3/4, then 1/4 would be 9 books divided by 3, which is 3 books.

That means she wrote 4 groups of 3 books this year, so she wrote a total of 3 times 4, which is 12 books!


12 

"
"Okay, so Michael drives 50 km every hour.  He drives for 3 whole days, which is 3 times 24 hours, so that's 72 hours of driving.

If he drives 50 km each hour for 72 hours, he goes 50 times 72 kilometers, which is 3600 kilometers.

The trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 kilometers long. To find out what percentage of the trip he finished, we do (3600 divided by 6000) times 100%. That equals 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes gone already.

Then their mom used 48 grapes for pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, at the beginning, they had 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 82 teachers but 13 were sick. That means 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were there.  Then they got 9 substitute teachers, so 69 + 9 = 78 teachers were at school.


78 

"
"Okay, so Bud makes mac and cheese every week.  The noodles cost a dollar, the cheddar cheese is three dollars, and the gruyere cheese is double the cheddar, so that's six dollars.  That means each week he spends ten dollars ($1 + $3 + $6 = $10).

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he spends 52 times ten dollars, which is $520.00.


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 80 classrooms to clean and it takes 15 minutes per room. That's 80 times 15, which is 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 times 60, or 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 480 times 5, which is 2400 minutes.

To find out what percentage of their time is spent cleaning, we do 1200 divided by 2400, which is 0.5.  Then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage, so 0.5 times 100 is 50%.


50 

"
"Okay, so Elly's middle shelves hold 10 books each, and she has two of those, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 books. The bottom shelf holds double the middle shelves, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

That means each bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since she has 110 books, she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought a bunch of eggs, right? Five dozens is like 5 times 12, which is 60 eggs. She paid $2.40 for each dozen, so that's 5 times $2.40, which is $12.00 total.

Now, she's selling them in groups of 3 for a dollar. So she can make 60 divided by 3, which is 20 groups.  That means she'll make 20 times $1.00, which is $20.00.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the money she made: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So Rose will make a profit of $8.00.


$8.00
"
"Okay, so Skyler has a bunch of hats. Half of them are red, which is 100 / 2 = 50 hats.  That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.  Then, 3/5 of those are blue, so that's (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.  That means he has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.


20 

"
"Okay, so the jerky is $18, but it's on sale for $3 off.  That means it costs $15.  There are 30 sticks in a bag, so each stick costs 15 divided by 30, which is 50 cents. 


50
"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the questions right on both tests together.  That means she needs to get 77 questions right (because 110 total questions times 0.70 is 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test, so she needs to get 35 right on the second test. 


35 

"
"Okay, so Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then she makes a bunch more blueberry cubes.  The blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, but she takes away 4.  

If she makes 116 cubes total, let's figure out how many are blueberry.

Let's say she makes 'x' strawberry cubes. Then the blueberry cubes are 5x - 4.

All together, that's x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining the 'x's, we get 6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 20. That means she made 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"
"Ara played a lot of games!  She played 40 games each year for four years, so that's 40 x 4 = 160 games.

If she scores 21 points in each game, then she scored a total of 160 x 21 = 3360 points.


3360 

"
"Okay, so Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half, which is 5. Then he found 3 of them.  That means he lost 2 marbles (5 - 3 = 2).

So he had 3 marbles left, plus the 2 he found, which is 5 marbles. But wait, one wasn't even a marble! So he only has 4 marbles left.

"
"Okay, so Jason wants to sell 15 cars.  He gets one person to come to the dealership for every 25 calls he makes.  Then, for every 2 people who come in, 1 buys a car.

So, he needs 15 people to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to come to the dealership (15 x 2 = 30).

To get 30 people to come in, he needs to make 750 phone calls (30 x 25 = 750).


750 

"
"Okay, so they have 4 flashlights, one for each person.  

Then they have 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles = 16 candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles = 20 candles.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the flashlights, they have 36 + 4 = 40 candles and flashlights.

"
"Okay, so Mitchell has 2 bags of chips and each bag has 55 chips. That's 2 times 55, which is 110 chips total.  He's sharing with 4 other people, so there are 5 people eating.  If they split the chips evenly, each person gets 110 divided by 5, which is 22 chips.

"
"Okay, so it takes John 5 minutes for the first side.  Then the next two sides take twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each. That's 20 minutes already. The last two sides are half the time of the first, so they each take 2.5 minutes.  So that's 5 minutes more.  

Let me add it all up: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes.


30 

"
"Okay, so there were 20 helmets.  There were half as many robots, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots. There were twice as many footballs as helmets, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

To find the total, we add them all up: 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = 70 items.


70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works for 6 hours a day, and each call takes him 15 minutes.  

First, we gotta figure out how many minutes he works in a day: 6 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 360 minutes.

Then, we divide the total minutes by how long each call takes: 360 minutes / 15 minutes per call = 24 calls a day.

Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the daily calls by 5: 24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls.


120 

"
"Okay, so the old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, and she has 6 paintings. That's 7 times 6, which is 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it's 12 times 6, which is 72 minutes.

To find out how much longer the new varnish takes, we subtract the old time from the new time: 72 minus 42 equals 30.


30

"Okay, so Crista has a lot of plants! Let's figure out how much water she needs.

* The plants that need half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups total.
* The plants that need a whole cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups total.
* That leaves 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants that need a quarter cup.
* Those plants need 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups total.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water.

"
"Okay, so Phineas has to go 200 yards. Half of that is on land, which is 100 yards.  He hops that part at 20 yards a minute, so that takes him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.

The other half is in the water, also 100 yards. He swims that at 10 yards a minute, so that takes 100 / 10 = 10 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the hopping time and the swimming time: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.


15 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks.  Each box has 8, so he'll need 56 divided by 8, which is 7 boxes. If each box costs $2.00, then 7 boxes will cost 7 times $2.00, which is $14.00.


$14.00 

"
"Okay, so the main phone costs $20, and the other phones cost half that, which is $10 each.  Since there are four extra phones, they cost a total of $10 x 4 = $40.

So, the whole plan costs $20 + $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 10 times 12, or 120 doughnuts.  He sells each one for $2, so he makes 120 times 2, which is $240 every day.

June has 30 days, so he makes $240 times 30, which is $7200 for the whole month.


$7200 

"
"Okay, so Jade takes a bunch of pictures, right?  She takes 210 in total.  She puts 7 pics in each group she uploads, and she does 6 groups every day.  So, that's 7 times 6, which is 42 pics a day.  

To find out how many days it takes, we divide the total pics by the pics per day: 210 pics / 42 pics/day = 5 days.


5 

"
"Okay, so Alicia has to dry clean 5 blouses at $5 each, so that's 5 times 5 which is $25.  Then she has 2 pairs of pants at $8 each, so that's 2 times 8 which is $16. And her skirt costs $6.  

So her total each week is $25 + $16 + $6 = $47.

Over 5 weeks, it would be $47 times 5, which is $235.


$235.00 

"
"Okay, so John talks super fast now!  

He used to talk 150 words every minute, but now he's 2.5 times faster, so that's 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute.

He has to read 10 pages with 450 words each, so that's 10 * 450 = 4500 words total.

To find out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes.


12 

"
"Okay, so Conor saw 50 people on the first day. Then 20 more came the next day, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.

The third day was super busy, twice as many as the second day, so that's 70 x 2 = 140 people!

For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day, and there are 4 more days, so that's 60 x 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the days: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.


500 

"
"Okay, so Garrett's popcorn is popping like crazy!

* First, he gets 20 popcorn pieces.
* Then, it pops three times faster, so that's 20 x 3 = 60 more.
* Next, it pops even faster, four times the first amount, so that's 20 x 4 = 80 popcorn pieces.
* But then it slows down to half the last amount, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 popcorn pieces.
* Even after he takes it off the heat, some more pop, about a quarter of the last batch, so that's 40 / 4 = 10 more.

Let's add them all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 popcorn pieces!


210
"
"Okay, so Tim needs lemons for 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and that's 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon.  He needs 6 lemons for each cup of juice, so that's 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

Then his friend wants an extra gallon that's super tart, like twice as much lemon juice. So that's 1 gallon * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup * 2 = 12 lemons.

In total, he needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.


36 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 German Shepherds and each one eats 5 kilograms of food a day. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 kilograms just for the German Shepherds.

Then there are 2 Bulldogs, and they each eat 3 kilograms a day. So that's 2 times 3, which is 6 kilograms for the Bulldogs.

 Altogether, they eat 15 plus 6, which is 21 kilograms every day.

In a week, that's 21 times 7, which equals 147 kilograms.


147 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 animals with 2 legs each, that's 10 times 2 which equals 20 legs. Then there are 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 times 4 which equals 60 legs.  

To find the total, we add the legs together: 20 + 60 = 80 legs.


80 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, which is 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks altogether.

If there are 32 blocks total, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks.


20 

"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, that's 5 times 18 which is 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so that's 8 times 18 which is 144 miles.  Since he's driving east, he's going back towards his house.  To find out how far he is from home, we subtract the distance he drove east from the distance he drove west: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.


54 

"
"Okay, so the boat starts at $9000.  The first year it loses 30% of its value, which is like 30 out of every 100.  So, it loses $2700 ($9000 x 0.30 = $2700). That means it's worth $6300 after the first year.

The second year it loses another 30%, so it loses $1890 ($6300 x 0.30 = $1890). Now it's worth $4410.

The third year it loses 20%, which is $882 ($4410 x 0.20 = $882).  That leaves it worth $3528.


$3528 

"
"Okay, so there are 232 candies in total.  There are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange, so that's 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow as red, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

If you add up all the red, orange, and yellow, that's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.

That means there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.


43 

"
"Okay, so Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80.  That means the hotel cost 3 * $80 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each ride was $80 * 0.10 = $8.

She took the bus 7 times, so that was 7 * $8 = $56.

In total, she spent $240 + $56 = $296 on the hotel and buses.


296 

"
"Okay, so Mazie starts with 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21, but he lost 4, so he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.  That means Darla got 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.


27 

"
"Okay, so they need two adult tickets which cost $12 each, so that's 2 times 12, which is 24 bucks. Then there's one kid's ticket for $8.  Popcorn is $3 each and they get two, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 dollars.

Let's add it all up: 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 dollars.


38 

"
"Okay, so the car weighs 1200 pounds, and there's also 250 pounds of stuff and two kids who each weigh 75 pounds.  That's 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds total.

To move it, he needs to push with 1% of that weight.  So, 1600 times 0.01 is 16 pounds.


16 

"
"Okay, so James needs enough streamer to go all the way around his fence.  That means we need to find out how long all the sides of the fence are together.

The fence is 20 feet long on one side and 15 feet long on the other side. To find the total length, we add up all the sides: 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 = 70 feet.


70 

"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and her older sister Emma is 16 years older. That means Emma is 56.  To find their average age, you add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 because there are two of them. 96 divided by 2 is 48.


48 

"
"Okay, so they found a bunch of seashells, but some were broken.  Let's see...

* Tom had 214
* Nancy had 432
* Benny had 86

That's 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells total!

But 67 were cracked, so we need to take those away: 732 - 67 = 665

They had 665 good seashells.


665 

"
"Okay, so Avery needs a plate setting for each person, right?  That's a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

Each setting costs $6 + $5 + $4 = $15.

Since she has 12 people coming, she needs 12 settings.

So, it'll cost her $15 x 12 = $180.00 


$180.00 

"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours. Half of that is 10 divided by 2, which is 5.  Anna took 2 more hours than that, so she took 5 + 2 = 7 hours.


7 

"
"Okay, so Dexter has 5 pigs and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. That's 8 pounds a day per pig!  

Since he has 5 pigs, they eat a total of 40 pounds a day (8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds).

In a week, that's 280 pounds (40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds).

If he started with 300 pounds of feed, he'll have 20 pounds left over (300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds).


20 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 36 more (40 - 4 = 36).

Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 6 packs (36 divided by 6 is 6). If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend $12 in total (6 times $2 is $12).


$12 

"
"Okay, so Frances makes $40 from selling cupcakes and $40 from selling cookies, that's $80 total.  She spends $20 on trays.  If she made $80 and spent $20, she has $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 kids at first. Then each kid gets a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids. Then on the next street, each kid gets two more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so 20 minus 5 is 15.


15 

"
"Okay, so Mamou started with 1360 meals. Then she gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  

To find out how many she has left, we do 1360 - 142 = 1218.

1218 

"
"Okay, so James has a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also has two nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 2 times 5, or 10 cents.  Then he has 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so that's 7 times 10, which is 70 cents.

If you add all that up, 25 + 10 + 70, he has 105 cents. 

105 

"
"Okay, so there are two brothers. One is 12, and the other is twice that age, so he's 12 x 2 = 24 years old.  There are three sisters, and they're all 16. So, the sisters are 16 x 3 = 48 years old together.

To find the total age, we add up everyone: 12 + 24 + 48 = 84 years old.


84 

"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day, and that's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for an hour, five days a week, so that's 300 minutes more.  That means she does 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, that's 2040 minutes!

2040 

"
"Okay, so Octavia has a bunch of old t-shirts she's gonna use.  

* The small ones are 3 feet by 3 feet, so each one is 3 times 3 which is 9 square feet.
* The medium ones are 4 feet by 4 feet, so they're 4 times 4 which is 16 square feet.
* The big ones are 6 feet by 6 feet, so they're 6 times 6 which is 36 square feet.

Let's see... she has 11 small ones, so that's 11 times 9 which is 99 square feet.

Then she has 8 medium ones, so that's 8 times 16 which is 128 square feet.

And 6 big ones, so that's 6 times 36 which is 216 square feet.

Now we add it all up: 99 + 128 + 216 = 443 square feet.


443 

"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 3 times 12, or 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more than that, so that's like half of 36, which is 18 more seeds.  So the big sunflower has 36 + 18 = 54 seeds.

Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.


90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that amount, which is 18 x 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.


27
"
"Okay, so Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches. That means Anne is 36 x 2 = 72 inches tall.

Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.

But she grew 3 inches over the summer, so before summer she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars each day and sell them for $2 each. That means they make 5000 * $2 = $10000 every day.

If they do that for a week, they make $10000 * 7 = $70000.

Over two weeks, they'd make $70000 * 2 = $140000.


$140000 

"
"Okay, so Jake gets a deal on the T-shirts.  One is full price, and the other is half off.  So, one T-shirt costs $8, and the other costs $8 / 2 = $4. That means the T-shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are 40% off, so we need to figure out how much the discount is. 40% of $40 is (40/100) * $40 = $16.  So the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add up the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 every week for doing his chores, and he did that for 3 weeks, so he made $6 x 3 = $18. Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 3 friends and himself for ice cream, so that's $1.25 x 4 = $5.  

That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, so that's $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 on each of the two bathrobes, so that's $30 + ($100 x 2) = $30 + $200 = $230.

To find out how much they spent together, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total: $105 + $230 = $335.


$335
"
"Okay, so Tim needs to figure out how much money he makes after making and selling his honey and jam mix.

First, let's see how much it costs him to make one jar:

* Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 = $12
* Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 = $12
* Honey: 2 pounds * $10 = $20
* Total cost: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes $50 - $44 = $6 profit on each jar.

If he sells 10 jars, he makes $6/jar * 10 jars = $60 profit.


$60 

"
"Okay, so let's see...

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 32 quarters are 32 x $0.25 = $8.00
* Dimes are 10 cents, so 95 dimes are 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
* Nickels are 5 cents, so 120 nickels are 120 x $0.05 = $6.00
* Pennies are 1 cent, so 750 pennies are 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, add it all up: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00


$31.00
"
"Okay, so Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, and then $7.50 for each movie ticket, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 for the tickets.  Then she spent $8.50 on a bracelet.  

Let's add up all her spending: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Her parents gave her $40.00, so she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00
"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week.  He fixes 3 cars each day, so that's 5 times 3, which is 15 cars a week.

He makes $4 for each car, so he makes 15 times 4, which is $60 each week.

Over two weeks, he'd make $60 times 2, which is $120.


$120 

"
"Okay, so Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, that's 18 total. He eats one of each kind, so that's 3 cookies gone, leaving him with 15. Then he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, so he has 13 left. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, so now he has 11.  Finally, he bakes 4 of each kind, which is 12 more cookies. That means he has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.


23 

"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  If he sells half for $5 each, that's 6 toys * $5 = $30.  Then the other 6 toys for $7 each is 6 toys * $7 = $42.  If he adds those together, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.


72 

"
"Okay, so the dog digs a bunch of holes while Nate's gone.  Let's see... 6 holes a day for 14 days is 6 times 14, which is 84 holes.

Then Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night. So that means Nate actually fills 9 - 6 = 3 holes each day.

To fill all 84 holes, it'll take him 84 holes / 3 holes a day = 28 days.

That's like, a whole month!  28 days is 4 weeks.


4 

"
"Okay, so Norman High has 4000 students. Butler High has 3/4 of that, which is like 3 out of 4 groups of 1000 students. So that's 3 groups of 1000, which is 3000 students.

Norman High has 1000 more students than Butler High.


1000 

"
"Let's see... they made 2595 rainbow cookies plus 3075 oatmeal cookies, so that's 5670 cookies.  If they made 7995 cookies total, then they made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.


2325 

"
"Okay, so Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half, which is 8.  He got 2 extra Petri dishes, so that's 16.  He got the right number of beakers, 7.  

That's 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 things in total. But Igor only put 29 things on the bench.

So, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 things.

Since he didn't lose any test tubes or Petri dishes, he must have lost 2 beakers. 


2 

"
"Okay, so James needs screws for 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws.  That means each table needs 4 legs * 2 screws/leg = 8 screws.

So for all 4 tables, he needs 4 tables * 8 screws/table = 32 screws.

He has 40 screws and only needs 32, so he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice that amount, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.  To find the total, we add the eggs from both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, so Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than that, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300. So Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up what everyone raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180


2180 

"
"Okay, so Vanessa ran 4 miles. Aaron is super fast, he runs twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron.  Aaron finished his part in 16 minutes. That means he runs a mile in 16 minutes divided by 4 miles, which is 4 minutes per mile. Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she takes 8 minutes per mile. Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 8 minutes per mile times 4 miles, which equals 32 minutes.


32 

"
"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there's 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.


594 

"
"Okay, so they get 6 groups of people each night, right? And each group spends $15 on food and drinks.  So that's 6 times $15, which is $90 each night.

If they're open two nights a week, they make $90 times 2, which is $180.


$180 

"
"Okay, so the guy bought 50 watermelons for $80.  He made a 25% profit, which means he made an extra $20 (cause 25% of 80 is 20).

So, he sold all the watermelons for $100 total.  To find out how much each one cost, we divide the total money he made by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

Each watermelon was sold for $2. 


$2
"
"Okay, so Dora is gonna be 12 in 3 years, so right now she's 9.  James is twice her age, so he's 18.  That means John had James when he was 19, so he's 37 now.  His youngest son was born when John was 32, so he's 5 now. In 3 years, he'll be 8. 


8
"
"Okay, so Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  If they both peel for a whole hour, which is 60 minutes, Ana will peel more oranges.

Let's see... 60 minutes divided by 3 minutes per orange is 20 oranges for Ana.

For Jane, it's 60 minutes divided by 4 minutes per orange, which is 15 oranges.

That means Ana peels 5 more oranges than Jane.


5 

"
"Okay, so the radiator was $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off.  That means he saved $400 x 0.80 = $320!

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour and it took 3 hours, so that's $50 x 3 = $150.

In total, he paid $80 + $150 = $230.


$230
"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and they have 70 legs in total. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4.  

To figure out how many chickens there are, we can think about it like this:

* If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40).
* That means there are some cows making up the extra 30 legs (70 - 40 = 30).
* Since each cow has 2 extra legs compared to a chicken, there must be 15 cows (30 / 2 = 15).
* If there are 15 cows, there are 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).


So the answer is 5. 

"
"Okay, so they have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. That's 7 times 8, which is 56 slices in total.  There are 4 people sharing, so they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
