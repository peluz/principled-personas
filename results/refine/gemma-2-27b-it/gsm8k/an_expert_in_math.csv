"Let's analyze John's trip.  

His initial outbound journey covers 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

During his return trip, he experiences 2 hours of no movement due to traffic.  He then travels an additional 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.

Finally, he covers 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles at a higher speed.

This gives him a total return distance of 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Therefore, John is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles from home.

"This is a classic geometric series problem.  The area of each level is half that of the one below it.  

The total area is the sum of the areas of each level: 16 + (16 * 2) + (16 * 2 * 2) + (16 * 2 * 2 * 2) = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

The average area per level is the total area divided by the number of levels: 240 square feet / 4 levels = 60 square feet per level.

* **Before the ants:** There were 5 fries + 1 fry (taken by ants) = 6 fries.
* **Before the raccoon:**  The raccoon took two-thirds, meaning the remaining 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon. So, there were 6 fries * 3 = 18 fries.
* **Before the pigeons:** The pigeons ate 9 fries, leaving 18 fries + 9 fries = 27 fries.
* **Before the seagull:** The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, meaning there were 27 fries + 7 fries = 34 fries.
* **Originally:** This 34 fries represents the initial amount Dave had.

"The total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

In this case:

* P = $100
* r = 0.02 (2% expressed as a decimal)
* n = 12 (interest is compounded monthly)
* t = 3/12 = 0.25 (3 months expressed as a fraction of a year)

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = $100(1 + 0.02/12)^(12*0.25)

We know the flag has a total of 76 stars. Three rows of 8 stars account for 24 stars (3 * 8 = 24), and two rows of 6 stars account for 12 stars (2 * 6 = 12).

This means the 5-star rows must contain the remaining stars: 76 - 24 - 12 = 40 stars.

Since each row of 5-star rows has 5 stars, there must be 8 rows of 5 stars (40 / 5 = 8).

"Let's break down this problem.  

Felix earns $0.25 per branch climbed.  Over the week, he earned a total of $105. To find his average daily climbs, we need to know how many branches he climbed in total and divide that by the number of days he worked.

Assuming a standard work week of 5 days, he climbed a total of $105 / $0.25 per branch = 420 branches.

Therefore, his average daily climb is 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.

* The second set adds 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals.
* The third set adds 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals.
* The final set adds 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals.

This gives us a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

However, Rose loses one flower from each group, resulting in a loss of 5 petals.

Therefore, the vase contains 101 - 5 = 96 petals.

"Let's break down this arcade scenario mathematically.

* **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of quarters Jack uses.
    *  Jack's worse friends use x * 0.5 quarters each.
    *  Jack's better friend uses x * 1.5 quarters.

* **Time conversion:** 4 hours of play is equal to 240 minutes.

* **Set up equations:**
    * Jack: 20 minutes/quarter * x = time played by Jack
    * Worse friends: 10 minutes/quarter * (x * 0.5) * 2 = time played by worse friends
    * Better friend: 30 minutes/quarter * (x * 1.5) = time played by better friend

* **Equate to total time:** The sum of all their playtimes must equal 240 minutes.

* **Solve for x:** This will give us the number of quarters Jack uses.

* **Calculate total cost:** Multiply the total number of quarters by $0.25. 

After performing these calculations, the total cost comes out to $17.00.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We know the total scrub volume is 10 ounces.  

Let 'z' represent the ounces of zest. Since the fragrance is equal to the zest, we also have 'z' ounces of fragrance.

The salt is twice the amount of zest, so we have 2z ounces of salt. The sugar is equal to the salt, so we also have 2z ounces of sugar.

Finally, the oil is twice the amount of salt, meaning we have 2 * (2z) = 4z ounces of oil.

The total amount of each ingredient is: z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 ounces.

Combining like terms, we get 10z = 10 ounces.

Solving for z, we find that z = 1 ounce.

Therefore, Tanya uses 4z = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break this problem down. We can use a system of equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each person has.

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Therefore, PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards. Finally, Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

* At $50 per chicken, his total earnings will be 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.
* To determine the cost of the chickens, we subtract his desired profit from his total earnings: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

"Let's analyze Kelly's grocery expenses. 

The cost of the chicken can be determined by multiplying the price per pack of bacon ($10 / 5 = $2) by 2, resulting in $4 per pack of chicken.  The total cost of the chicken is then $4 * 6 = $24.

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4 / 2 = $2. The total cost of the apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

The total cost of all the items is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Therefore, Kelly has $65 - $60 = $5 remaining in her budget.

*  The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50%, meaning there's a 50% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework due to the absence of the regular teacher.

* If the regular teacher is present, there's a 40% chance of a class-wide extension, again negating the need to submit the homework.

* Even without a class extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can secure a personal extension.

Therefore, the only scenario where Marcus *must* turn in his homework is when the regular teacher is present, there's no class extension, and he fails to convince the teacher about his dog. This probability is calculated as:

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

We're given:

*  The red rope (r) is four times the length of the blue rope (b):  r = 4b
*  The blue rope (b) is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope (y): b = y - 7
*  The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters: r + b + y = 37

To find the length of the red rope, we can use substitution. 

1. **Substitute** the second equation (b = y - 7) into the first equation: r = 4(y - 7)

2. **Simplify:** r = 4y - 28

3. **Substitute** both the simplified equation for 'r' and the equation for 'b' into the third equation: (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

4. **Combine** like terms: 6y - 35 = 37

5. **Add** 35 to both sides: 6y = 72

6. **Divide** both sides by 6: y = 12

7. **Substitute** the value of 'y' back into the equation b = y - 7: b = 12 - 7, so b = 5

8. **Finally, substitute** the value of 'b' into the equation r = 4b: r = 4 * 5, so r = 20



Therefore, the red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break down this word problem.

Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, meaning she started with 3 * $5 = $15.

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her original amount remaining. This means she gave away 1/5 of $15, which is $3.

Since both Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their sister, Ronnie also gave $3.  Therefore, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Initial Bills:**  Thomas begins with $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills.
* **Bills Lost:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.
* **Payment:** He uses half his remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.
* **Bills Remaining:** After paying, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.
* **Tripling Money:** Tripling his money means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills (each worth $20).
* **Total Money:** This equates to 60 bills * $20/bill = $1200.
* **Conversion to $5 Bills:** Converting to $5 bills results in $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 bills.

"Let's break down the scoring:

* Team B scores 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, meaning they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.
* In the second half, Team B quadruples their first-half score, netting 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scores a quarter of Team B's second-half total, adding 8 / 4 = 2 more goals.

Summing up, Team A scores a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scores 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

The match sees a total of 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.  We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

*  w = 5(c + 7) 
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Solving the first equation for 'w', we get:

* w = 5c + 35

Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:

* c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* 75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

"Let's break this problem down.  Jay's snowball production is a classic example of a system with both input and output. He builds snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, but experiences a loss of 2 snowballs every 15 minutes due to melting.

First, we need to determine the net gain in snowballs per hour. Since there are four 15-minute intervals in an hour, Jay loses 2 snowballs/interval * 4 intervals/hour = 8 snowballs per hour.

This means his net gain is 20 snowballs/hour - 8 snowballs/hour = 12 snowballs per hour.

To reach his goal of 60 snowballs, it will take him 60 snowballs / 12 snowballs/hour = 5 hours.

"Let's break down this relay race problem.  

Vanessa's distance is twice Aaron's, and Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's. This means Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile as Aaron does.

Since Aaron ran his portion in 16 minutes for 4 miles, he runs a mile in 4 minutes. Vanessa, running at half his speed, takes 8 minutes per mile.

Therefore, Vanessa's total time for 4 miles is 4 miles * 8 minutes/mile = 32 minutes.

"Let's break down the revenue calculation:

* Each reservation generates $15 in revenue (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine).
* With 6 reservations per night, the nightly revenue is $90 (6 reservations * $15/reservation).
* Operating 2 nights a week results in a weekly revenue of $180 ($90/night * 2 nights/week).

"Let's break down this age problem:

* Dora's age in 3 years is a key piece of information.  Since she'll be 12 then, she's currently 9 years old.

* James is twice Dora's age, making him 18.

* John was 19 when James was born, so he's currently 37 years old.

* John's youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5.

* In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Let's analyze the peeling rates:

* Ana peels at a rate of 1 orange every 3 minutes.
* Jane peels at a rate of 1 orange every 4 minutes.

Over an hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Jane will peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"This is a classic system of equations problem.  Let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows. We know:

* c + w = 20  (total animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Solving for 'c', we find that there are **5** chickens.
