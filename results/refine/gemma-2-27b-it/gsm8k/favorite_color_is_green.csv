"That's a great question! Flipping houses can be a lucrative venture if done right.  

Here's how to figure out Josh's profit:

* The house increased in value by 150% of its original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.
* After the repairs, the house is worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
* Josh's total investment was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.
* His profit is $200,000 (sale price) - $130,000 (investment) = $70,000.

* She already gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
*  So, she needs to give them 60 - 40 = 20 cups more.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning for every 7 years Darrell ages, Allen ages 11. Their combined age is 162.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we first need to figure out their current ages.  Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  

* Add the ratio parts: 7 + 11 = 18
* Divide their total age by the sum of the ratio parts: 162 / 18 = 9. This means each ""part"" of the ratio represents 9 years.

Now we can find their current ages:

* Darrell: 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years old
* Allen: 11 parts * 9 years/part = 99 years old

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, simply add 10:

Let's break it down:

*  Let 'l' be the number of games lost.

Since he watched 7 hours total, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Adrien's salary was a nice 30% bump above Lylah's.  Four years later, Adrien's salary jumped another 40%.  Since they both got raises at the same time, we can figure out their combined salaries four years down the road.

Here's the green light to the solution:

* Adrien started earning $40,000 four years ago. That means Lylah was making $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

* Adrien's raise was 40% of his old salary, which is $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000.

* Four years later, Adrien is making $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

* Lylah also got a 40% raise, so hers was $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69 (approximately).

* Four years later, Lylah is making $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

* Together, their salaries four years later add up to $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

We know Seth is twice Brooke's age, and in two years, they'll add up to 28 years old.  

If we think about it, Brooke's age in two years plus Seth's age in two years has to equal 28.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say:

Brooke's age in two years + 2 * (Brooke's age in two years) = 28

That means 3 * (Brooke's age in two years) = 28

So, Brooke's age in two years is 28 / 3 = 9.33 years old.

Since we want to know Brooke's current age, we subtract 2 years: 9.33 - 2 = 7.33 years old.

If we think about it, the white chickens are the real egg-laying superstars! They lay 5 eggs a day, which is more than the red chickens.  Since there are more white chickens, they must be contributing a good chunk of those 42 eggs.

To figure out exactly how many red chickens there are, we need to use some math.  

Let's say there are 'r' red chickens. That means there are 'r + 2' white chickens.

We can set up an equation to represent the total eggs:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Solving for 'r' will tell us how many red chickens Jerry has.

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, it will take him 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"Like a lush green meadow, this problem needs a little watering to bloom!  

Let's think about it:

* Both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in water between them is changing because of the leak.
* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool. Now it has four times the water. That means the big pool lost less water than the small pool in those four minutes.

Since they both leak at the same rate, the big pool must have started with more water.  

If the big pool has four times the water now, and it lost less water than the small pool, the small pool must have a smaller amount of water now.

Let's say the small pool has 'S' gallons now. The big pool has 4S gallons.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had 4S + 16 gallons, and the small pool had S + 16 gallons.

We know 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)

Solving for S, we get S = 8.

"Let's break this down. Andrea has 52 apples, and that's 8 more than Jamal. So Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together, they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Let's break down this knitting project!  

The collar uses 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

That leaves 1800 stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches for both sleeves.

Each sleeve takes 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches.

"That's easy!  Let's see... food is $25 a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 a month for food.  Then add the treats and medicine: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 a month.  Over a whole year, that's $220 * 12 = $2640.

"Let's break down John's vacation time!

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours.  He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours. That's 15 hours in total for those activities.

We know those activities make up 30% of his vacation.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

"Let's figure out how much more money Annabelle needs!

She wants a phone that costs $400 and already has $80 saved. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

But wait! She's got two jobs.  

* Job 1: $10/hour * 20 hours = $200
* Job 2: $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

That's a total of $200 + $75 = $275 earned from her jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

Finally, subtract that from the phone's price: $400 - $355 = $45

"Let's figure out how much money Dean has left!

* He spent $12 on toy cars (6 cars * $2/car).
* He spent $5 on teddy bears (5 bears * $1/bear).

* Mini-golf and the arcade tokens cost $10 per person.
* Go-karts cost $20 per person.
* That means each friend will cost Morgan $30.

Since Morgan has $90 and needs $30 for herself, she has $60 left for her friends.

* The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles going to the second and third cities.
* Coming back, it travels 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.
* That's a total of 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles for one round trip.
* Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips = 900 miles per day.
*  It needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

* The picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.
* Etching adds another 20% to each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  
* The total etching cost is 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords.
* The cords cost $12 each, so that's 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"Let's break this down!  

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  The area is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. So, 360 square feet = 9 feet * width. That means the width is 40 feet.

To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's break down this triathlon timing problem!

* Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

* James is 10% faster in the swim, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

* James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, for a total of 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

* Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

*  That means James's run time is 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

Since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% fewer red ones than blue, we know green has the most.

All together, that's b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500 jelly beans.

Combining like terms, we get 3b = 4500.

So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.

Let's try subtracting pairs of sheep (since they have the extra legs) until we get close to 70 legs.

* If we had 15 sheep, that's 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60).
* That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10).

Think of it like this: if we took away those extra 7 years from the older twin, we'd have a group where everyone is the same age.  

Let's say the triplets are each 'r' years old. That means one twin is 'r + 7' years old, and the other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age of the group would be: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

Combining like terms: 5r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Dividing both sides by 5: r = 6

That means each triplet is 6 years old.  

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Let's break this down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Since she fills a 10-ounce jar, we can think of the ingredients like pieces of a puzzle that add up to 10.  

If we let the zest be represented by ""1 piece,"" then the fragrance is also ""1 piece."" The salt would be ""2 pieces"" (twice the zest), the sugar is also ""2 pieces,"" and the oil is ""4 pieces"" (twice the salt).

Adding all the pieces together: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10

* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 cards.

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find x = 47.

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a whole month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so daily that's 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In a month, it's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 earns 43200 * $6 = $259200 a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 earns 32400 * $6 = $194400 a month.

"This is a classic problem about figuring out how many points each person scored!  

Here's how we can solve it:

* Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.
* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, meaning Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.

To find out Azibo's score (x), we add up all the points and set it equal to the team's total points:

x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Let's see... Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon, Stan caught 'S', and Alex caught 'X'. We know:

* Stan has 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught: S = 4A - 13
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
* Together they caught 339: A + S + X = 339

Now we can use substitution to solve for S.  

First, let's put the 'S' from the first equation into the second equation: X = (4A - 13) + 5, which simplifies to X = 4A - 8.

Then, substitute both 'S' and 'X' into the third equation: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Simplifying that gives us 9A - 21 = 339.  Adding 21 to both sides, we get 9A = 360.  Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Finally, plug A = 40 back into the equation S = 4A - 13: S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

"Let's figure out how many more plants Pat needs!  

First, we need to figure out the total space in inches: 111 feet times 12 inches per foot equals 1332 inches.

Each plant needs 30 inches of space (12 inches wide plus 18 inches between plants).  So, Pat can fit 1332 inches divided by 30 inches per plant, which is about 44.4 plants. Since she can't buy parts of plants, she'll need 45 plants total.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 45 minus 17, which equals 28 more plants.

* Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so she pumps 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.
* That's a total of 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

* On the second day, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her first day's amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumps in one-third of her first day's amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.
* That's a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

* Altogether, they pumped in 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

* They still need to pump in 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons to fill the tank.

"This problem reminds me of figuring out how much paint is left in a can after a project!  

Let's break it down:

* The power bank lost 45% in the first 5 hours and another 21% in the next 3 hours, for a total loss of 66%.
* That means 34% of the charge was left before Maria's friends started using it.
* Since the final charge was 28%, her friends used 6% of the power bank's capacity (34% - 28% = 6%).
*  This 6% represents a portion of the 34% that was left after the initial losses. To find the original charge, we can set up a proportion: 6% / 34% = x / 100%

Solving for x, we get x = 17.65% (approximately).

"Let's break this down.  Teresa makes a tidy profit selling those cuddly creatures!

Since each small stuffed animal costs $4 and she sells the large ones for three times that, the large ones must cost $12.  

She sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so if she sold 'x' large stuffed animals, she sold 2x small ones.

Her earnings from the large stuffed animals are 12x, and from the small ones, they are 8x (because 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

* The first set had 4 more than the second, so that's 'x + 4' balls.
* The third set had half the number of the second, which is 'x / 2' balls.

Adding those all together: (x + 4) + x + (x / 2) = 19

Now we can solve for x!

1. Combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So the second set had 6 balls.

The first set had 4 more than that, meaning it had 10 balls.

Let's break it down:

* Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes.
* Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.
* Together they took 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98

Solving for x:

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter. Since the deal is buy one get one half off, he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and get 3 pounds at half price.

That means he'll pay $4.00/pound * 3 pounds = $12.00 for the full-price butter.

The discounted butter will cost $4.00/pound * 0.50 (50% off) = $2.00/pound. So, the discounted butter will cost $2.00/pound * 3 pounds = $6.00.

In total, the butter will cost $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"Let's figure out the cost of Kayla's party!

First, we need to know how many extra guests are coming beyond the initial 20 included in the rental fee.  Kayla invited 45 people, and 4 can't make it, so that's 45 - 4 = 41 guests attending.

That means there are 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests.

Each extra guest costs $6, so the extra guests will cost 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, add the base rental fee: $125 + $126 = $251.

"Green is such a vibrant and refreshing color, don't you think?  

Anyway, let's figure this out.  

To cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people, we need to know how much energy that represents.  Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's needs, and we have 2300 people, that's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needed.

Currently, Hortex produces enough to cover 4200 bottles * 20% per bottle = 84,000% of daily energy needs.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Finally, to see how many more bottles are needed, we divide the remaining energy need by the energy per bottle: 146,000% / 20% = 7300 bottles.

* He earns $80 for each of his regular lessons, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.
* For veterans, he charges $60 per lesson, and he has 2 of those, bringing in 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding those together, Charlie makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Let's figure this out!  Each bookcase can hold a good amount of books.  

* The middle shelves hold 10 books each, so that's 10 + 10 = 20 books.
* The bottom shelf holds double the middle shelves, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 books.
* The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, so that's 40 - 5 = 35 books.

That means each bookcase holds 20 + 40 + 35 = 95 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 95 = 1.16 bookcases. Since you can't have part of a bookcase, she'll need 2 bookcases to fit all her books.
