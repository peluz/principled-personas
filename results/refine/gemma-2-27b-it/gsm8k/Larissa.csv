"Okay, so Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. That's a total of $130,000 invested.  

The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he bought it for.

Adding that to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

His profit is the selling price minus his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Well, let's see... Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them a total of 60 cups.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Since every other glass is discounted, Kylar is basically buying glasses in pairs.  Each pair costs $5 + ($5 * 0.60) = $8.

He's buying 16 glasses, which is 8 pairs, so the total cost is 8 * $8 = $64.

"Let's figure this out! If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 equals a total of 260 sheep.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, so to download the whole 200 GB file would normally take 100 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes).

But, the restart throws a wrench in things! She loses 80 GB of progress (40% of 200 GB) after 40 minutes of downloading.  

That means she has to download the whole 200 GB again, which takes another 100 minutes.

Adding up the initial 40 minutes, the 20-minute restart, and the full 100-minute download, the total time is 160 minutes.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

The program had 60 downloads the first month. The second month it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then in the third month, downloads dropped by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"Let's break this down. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more!  

Think of it like this:

* She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That means the 5 she has left are what's remaining after selling to the orange house.
* Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, she must have had double that amount before.

So, if she has 5 left, she had 5 x 2 = 10 before the orange house.

Now, remember she sold some at the red house, so she had even more before that.

And before the green house, she had even more!

Let's work backwards:

* **Before orange house:** 10
* **Before red house:** 10 + 2 = 12
* **Before green house:** 12 x 3 = 36



Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners. 

**Answer:** 36 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the students are doing contemporary, which is 4 students. That leaves 16 students. Then 25% of those students are doing jazz, which is another 4 students.  That means 12 students are doing hip-hop.  So, 12 out of 20 students are hip-hop dancers, which is 60%.

"Okay, let's break this down. Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so she earns $20 * 35 = $700 each week from teaching.

As a cheer coach, she makes $30 an hour and works 15 hours a week, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 per week.

In total, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

"Let's figure this out!

* Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, for a total of $33.

"Let's figure this out!

Cynthia needs enough ice cream for 60 days, and she eats one serving per day, so that's 60 servings total.  Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7:11, we know their age difference is represented by those numbers.  

*  Their total age is 162, so we need to find numbers that add up to 162 and are in the ratio 7:11.

*  Think of it like splitting 162 into 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18).

* Each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

* Allen is 11 parts, so he's 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

* In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

* Friend 2 said 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess, so that's 80 / 2 + 20 = 60.
* Friend 3 said 25% more than Friend 1, so that's 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Adding up all the guesses, we get 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  

Dividing by 3 to find the average, we get 240 / 3 = 80.

"Let's see... Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  To figure out how many gold coins she has, we can think of it like this:

If we take away those extra 30 gold coins, we'd have the same number of gold and silver coins. That means there would be 110 coins / 2 = 55 of each type.

Since there are 30 more gold coins, Gretchen has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins.

"
"Let's figure this out!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Terry needs 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days, that's 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

To figure out John's speed, we need to know his total running time. He runs 3 hours the first day and 1.5 hours each on the other two days, for a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours of running per week.

Since he runs 60 miles in those 6 hours, he runs at a speed of 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  If Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, then she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours).

That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

"Okay, so you want to know how many grams of chips you can have.  You've got 200 calories left and each serving is 250 calories. That means you can only have 0.8 of a serving.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles for $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit will be $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday, and then 2/5 more on Tuesday, which is 2 articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she doubled her Tuesday output, meaning she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she wrote 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles over the three days.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.

"Let's see... Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh 7.5 pounds (30 comic books * 0.25 pounds each). That means he needs to take out another 7.5 pounds of toys (15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds). Since each toy weighs 0.5 pounds, he needs to remove 15 toys (7.5 pounds / 0.5 pounds per toy = 15 toys).

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding the two halves together, her total cost for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Okay, so Luke's sandcastle is getting smaller with each level.  If the top is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down.

The level below the top would be 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.

The level below that would be 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.

And the bottom level would be 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 + 60 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

Since there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

* The inside width is 6 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 4 inches.
* The inside height is 4 inches (outer) - 2 inches (walls) = 2 inches.

That's a total of $150 + $120 = $270. Since she spent $100 on the 2x4s and $80 on the 4x4s, her total profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

* For every 1 queen bee, there are 2 baby bees.
* For every 1 queen bee, there are 4 worker bees (2 baby bees * 2 worker bees per baby bee).

So, if we think of the hive as groups of 7 bees (1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers), we can figure out how many groups there are by dividing the total number of bees by 7: 700 bees / 7 bees per group = 100 groups.

Since each group has 4 worker bees, there are 100 groups * 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this down. If Seth is twice Brooke's age, that means if Brooke is 'b' years old, Seth is '2b' years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' and Seth will be '2b + 2'.  We know that their ages added together at that point will be 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That's half the die's faces. So, there's a 50% chance of rolling a number bigger than 3.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance. So, the chance of both happening is 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

That means rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely.

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees).  But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

* Griffin starts with 24 fries.
* Kyle takes 5, leaving Griffin with 19.
* Billy takes twice what Kyle took (2 * 5 = 10 fries), leaving Griffin with 9.
* Colby takes 3 less than Kyle (5 - 3 = 2 fries), leaving Griffin with 7.
* Griffin ends up with 27 fries, so Ginger must have given him 20 fries (27 - 7 = 20).

"Oh honey, that's a lot of makeup! Let's see... $250 an hour for six hours a day is $1500.  And she needs that four days a week, so that's $6000 a week. Over five weeks, that's a whopping $30,000! But luckily, the makeup artist gave her a 10% discount for being such a good client.  So, 10% of $30,000 is $3000 off. That brings the total down to $27,000.

$27000

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

The chef bought 200 pounds of onions (4 bags x 50 pounds/bag). Since onions cost $1.50 per pound, the total cost is 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Sue ate a lot of cookies! On Monday, she ate 4 times her sister's 5 cookies, so that's 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate double her sister's 13 cookies, which is 26 cookies.  

That means Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories.

Sue ate 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Let's figure this out!

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so she went down 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. That means Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together they have a total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Oh, that's a tricky one! Let's see...

The house costs $350,000, and then there's a 5% brokerage fee, so that's $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500.  

Plus, there's a 12% transfer fee, which is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

Adding those to the original price, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

"Hi there!  

Let's break down Mr. Tan's house sale.  

First, we need to figure out his total expenses. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000, which is $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000, which is $20,000.  Adding those together with the $250,000 he paid for the loan, his total expenses are $282,000.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.


$118,000 

"
"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% of that time to get to 400 degrees.  That's 20 * 0.40 = 8 more minutes. So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, that's 28 + 23 = 51 minutes from start to finish.

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes double the collar stitches, meaning it needs 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

That means the body, collar, and rosette together use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $30,000 before taxes. With a 20% tax rate, Nick would take home $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but there's a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax on what's left. After the property tax, he'd have $36,000, and 10% of that is $3,600 in taxes. That means his take-home pay would be $32,400.

Job B pays $8,400 more than Job A.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so her initial investment is $64. The first year, the stock jumps up 50%, meaning each share is now worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12.  That puts her total value at 8 shares * $12/share = $96.

But then the stock takes a hit the second year, dropping 25%. That's a decrease of $12 * 0.25 = $3 per share.  So, the final price is $12 - $3 = $9 per share.

Finally, her 8 shares are worth 8 * $9 = $72.

"Let's see... Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so he ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs. That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's break this down.  If two groups are the same size, and the third is smaller by 10, we can think about it like this:

* Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 200 students. So, 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides gives us 3x = 210

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 70.

That means the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Let's see... 60 animals, twice as many chickens as cows...  

Okay, so if we think of it like this:

* If there were only cows, there'd be 60 / 3 = 20 cows.
* Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

All together, that's 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

* Yellow snake: 50 + 10 = 60 pounds
* Red bird: 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Adding those up: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find the total time, we divide 15 hours by 0.30, which equals 50 hours.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles a day.

* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so those will be 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers. Cords for them will cost 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

"Okay, let's break down Tom's trip:

* He traveled 200 kilometers a day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
* Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of his first four days' distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* He took a break for one day, so no kilometers there.
* In the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all that up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Let's break this down! Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over for fun stuff, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, so the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  

Since he can't have half a card, Kenny must have started with 50 cards.

We know the area of a rectangle is length times width.  We're given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet. So, to find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, the perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, so we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

James is a bit slower on the bike than Jon, but faster in the swim. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have made up some time on the run.  

Here's how we can figure out James's run time:

* **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
* **James's swim time:** 40 minutes * 0.90 (10% faster) = 36 minutes
* **James's bike time:** 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
* **James's total time:** 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time = 121 minutes + James's run time

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon's:

* 121 minutes + James's run time = 170 minutes - 10 minutes
* 121 minutes + James's run time = 160 minutes

Subtract 121 minutes from both sides to find James's run time:

* James's run time = 39 minutes

* First, we need to see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

* For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it'll eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

* Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

* Michael has six $5 bills, meaning he has 6 * $5 = $30.

*  After buying the hay, he'll have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 160 bags (320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags).

"To figure out when the costs are the same, we need to think about how much each venue will cost depending on the number of guests.

Venue 1 has a base cost of $200, and then it's $5 more per person for food. So, if 'x' is the number of guests, Venue 1 costs $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 is simpler: it's $25 per person, so the total cost is $25x.

We want to know when these two costs are equal, so we set them equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for 'x':

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

Two of Cherrie's friends want five gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.

The other three friends each want two gifts, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

That means she bought 10 + 6 = 16 gifts already.

With the extra 10 gifts, she bought a total of 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.

Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.

John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, so in one hour, she burns another 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs to drink 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we can think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point.  

Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99b red jelly beans and 1.01b green jelly beans.

All together, that's b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500 jelly beans.

Combining like terms, we get 3b = 4500.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 red jelly beans and 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.

Finally, there are 1515 - 1485 = 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

If Jared increases his speed by 5 WPM one more time, he'll be typing at 57 WPM.  To find the average, we add up all three speeds (47, 52, and 57) and then divide by 3.

She also invited 10 friends directly, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses, so that's 10 + 8 = 18 more people.

"Let's break this down!  

We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If we call the smallest angle ""x"", the other two angles are 2x and 3x.  

That means x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 30

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's see... Colby has a lot of coins!

* His 14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents.
* And his 15 pennies are worth 15 cents.

Adding it all up, Colby has $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Then he sold 10 cups an hour for 2 hours, making 10 * 2 = 20 cups.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles = 145,000 rotations/month).

Since each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, they should last him 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months).

That's 6 years (72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years).

"Okay, so the shampoo bottle costs $24.00 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps per wash.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump, the bottle will last twice as long, meaning she gets 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

"Okay, so Shania made her dress longer by adding 50% of the original length, and then added another 20cm of lace.  If the dress is now 140cm long, we can work backwards to find the original length.

Let's think of it like this:

* The 140cm length includes the original length PLUS the 50% increase PLUS the 20cm lace.

*  If we take away the 20cm lace, we're left with 120cm.

* That 120cm represents 150% of the original length (100% + 50% increase).

* To find the original length, we divide 120cm by 1.50, which gives us 80cm.



So the original dress was 80cm long.

"Let's see... we have one set of twins and one set of triplets.  One twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years, and all together they add up to 44 years old.  

To figure out how old one of the twins is, we can think of it like this:

* Let's say the triplets are all 'r' years old.
* One twin is 'r + 7' years old.
* The other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That means 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one of the triplets is 6 years old.

That means one of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Okay, let's break this down. Lorraine's got a lot of sticker trading going on!

* **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:** She trades 27 small stickers for 9 large buttons (since each small sticker gets her 1 small button, and 27 small buttons equal 9 large buttons).

* **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:** She trades half her large stickers, which is 20, for 20 more large buttons.

* **Leftover Large Stickers to Small Buttons:** She has 20 large stickers left. Those get her 60 small buttons (20 x 3 = 60).

* **Total Buttons:**  Adding it all up, she has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons!

"Joey played a lot of football this week! Let's see, he played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double the Monday amount on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 games.

"Let's see... twice as many voted for as against, and there are 33 council members in total.  That means the votes must split into three equal parts.

"
"Let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs!

*  She needs 22 small shirts because twice as many students need small as extra-small.
*  She needs 18 medium shirts because that's 4 less than the number of small shirts.
*  She needs 9 large shirts because that's half the number of medium shirts.
*  She needs 15 extra-large shirts because that's 6 more than the number of large shirts.

Adding all those up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

"Okay, so 20% of the people like horse #2, which is 10 people out of 50. That leaves 40 people.  Then 60% of those folks like horse #7, so that's 24 people.  That means 16 people must think horse #12 will win!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can set up a little equation. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. That means the first house needs x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so it needs x cases.

Adding those up: x/2 + x + x = 250

That simplifies to 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

So Mike has 600 movies.  A third of those are in series, which is 200 movies. Since he can get those for a third of the price of a regular movie, that'll be 200 * ($10 / 3) = $666.67.

That leaves 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest of the movies, 240 of them, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get half that time, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter. His really good friend gets to play for 1.5 times as long, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* His awesome friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

If Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, and Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, we can figure this out step by step. Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. That means Smendrick has 3x cards, and Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

If we add all their cards together, it should equal 341: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

So PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out the cost for Angela's installation.

The base installation is $129.00, but she has a few extra items.  She needs 2 more mirrors than the basic package, which is an extra $30.00. She also has one extra chandelier for $15.00 more. And lastly, she has 10 extra pictures, costing an additional $150.00.

Adding it all up: $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00


$324.00

"Let's figure this out!

Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, who has $20.00. That means Anthony has $30.00.

Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so he saved an extra $12.00 (40% of $30.00).

Adding that to Anthony's savings, Roy has a total of $42.00.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high, Saskay can lift one 12 times higher, which is 12 inches. Kagiyami can lift one 4 times higher than that, so that's 48 inches. And Naruto can lift one 10 times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift a mountain 480 inches high.

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Mason travels 8 miles every hour.  If he goes for 4 hours, that's 8 * 4 = 32 miles. Then he goes for another 6 hours, so that's 8 * 6 = 48 more miles. In total, he travels 32 + 48 = 80 miles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, and we need to find the total unused length, we need to find out how much is left of each stick and add it up.

* **Stick 1:** 12 mm * (1/6) = 2 mm used, so 12 mm - 2 mm = 10 mm left
* **Stick 2:** 12 mm * (2/3) = 8 mm used, so 12 mm - 8 mm = 4 mm left
* **Stick 3:** 12 mm * (1/2) = 6 mm used, so 12 mm - 6 mm = 6 mm left

Now, let's add up the unused portions: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

"
"Let's figure this out!

The car costs $10000, and the phone costs $800. That means the total cost is $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 saved and his brother gave him $200, so he has $5200 in total.

To find out how much more he needs, we subtract his savings from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Gabriel still needs $5600.

* Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
* Altogether, they have 90 socks (60 + 30) and 90 dishes (60 + 30).

That means they have a total of 180 socks and dishes together.

"Let's break this down.  If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know a few things:

* Anne has F - 12 books.
* Sofie has F + 13 books.

All together, they have 85 books, so:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Dividing both sides by 3: F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Mini cinnamon rolls have 200 calories each (600 / 3 = 200) and mini blueberry muffins have 150 calories each (450 / 3 = 150).

That means the cinnamon rolls have a total of 40,000 calories (200 rolls * 200 calories/roll) and the muffins have 45,000 calories (300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin).

Adding those together, Andrew's pastries have a total of 85,000 calories.

We know the three ages add up to 100.  Paul is older than John by 10 years, and Peter's age is the total of Paul's and John's ages.  

If we think of it like this:

*  John's age + Paul's age + Peter's age = 100

And we know:

* Paul's age = John's age + 10
* Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

We can put it all together to figure out Peter's age.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Together, their points add up to 45: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


Azibo scored 5 points.

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

If the hospital starts with 1/5 of its beds full, that's 200 beds (1000 beds * 0.2 = 200 beds). That leaves 800 beds empty.

Over two weeks, they admit 700 new patients (50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients).

Adding those to the initially occupied beds, we get 900 occupied beds (200 beds + 700 patients = 900 beds).

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total number of beds gives us 100 unoccupied beds (1000 beds - 900 beds = 100 beds).

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first. That means there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day.  Since ye can't have part of a hole, I reckon the map was a bit off.

So, they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, and together they caught 339 Pokemon, we can use some algebra to solve for Stan's catch.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon. That means Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.  

We also know Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught 4A - 13 + 5, or 4A - 8 Pokemon.

Adding up all their catches, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Combining like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9: A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now we can find Stan's catch: 4 * 40 - 13 = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed.  Since each plant needs 1.5 feet of space between them, and they are 12 inches wide, that's a total of 18 inches per plant (12 + 18 = 30).

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12 = 1332).

So, Pat can fit 44.4 plants in her bed (1332 / 30 = 44.4). Since she can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants in total.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17 = 28).

* His lawyer will give three times that amount, so that's $2000 * 3 = $6000.

"Let's see... 100 guests brought 15 cookies each, so that's 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.  The bride gave half to the church, which is 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people.

"Each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid's slice, so think of it like this: the adults get 2 parts each, and each kid gets 1 part. That means there are 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 parts in total.  Since each adult gets 2 parts, that's 2/8 or 25% of the watermelon.

"Let's see... Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients to check on, and that takes 20 minutes per patient, so that's 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.  That's 3 hours. He also has 10 appointments at 30 minutes each, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 minutes, or 5 hours.  

In total, that's 3 + 5 = 8 hours.  If he works a 9-hour day, he has 9 - 8 = 1 hour left for records.

"Okay, let's break this down.  They charge $25 to rent the studio and then $1.50 per student. With 10 students, that's an extra $15 per session. So each session costs $40.

They have classes 3 days a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 per week.

In a month, assuming 4 weeks, they'd make $120 x 4 = $480.

"Let's figure this out! If Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, that means each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so each of her boxes has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.  Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to fill that pool!

First, we need to find the volume. That's width times length times depth: 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

The pool company said to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons: 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 gallons/cubic foot = 8260 gallons.

Finally, multiply the gallons by the price per gallon: 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.00

"Let's figure this out!

* Matteo drove 55 miles/hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles.
* Shandy drove 45 miles/hour for 10 hours, meaning she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.
* Shandy drove 450 - 220 = 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students.  A quarter of those are boys, meaning 375 are boys over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the students are under 16, so that's another 1500 students. Half of them are boys, which is 750 boys. That means there are 750 girls under 16.

Adding the girls from both age groups, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank on the first day, which is 18000 gallons * (1/4) = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

That's a total of 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her first day's amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her first day's amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

That's another 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

The tank still needs 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons to be full.

"Ugh, this is tricky! Okay, so let's see... her power bank lost 9% every hour for 5 hours, that's 45% total. Then it lost another 21% over 3 hours. So in total, it lost 66% of its charge.

That means when she started charging her friends' phones, it had 34% left (100% - 66% = 34%).  But it ended up with only 28% left, so her friends used 6% of the power bank's charge.

Since that 6% came from the 34% that was left, we can figure out what 100% was originally.  It's like a proportion: 6% is to 34% as  'x' is to 100%.

Solving that, we get x = 17.65%.

So, her power bank was about 17.65% charged when she left for the park.

"Let's break this down.  If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones are $4, then large ones are $12.  She sold twice as many small ones as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small ones.

Her earnings from the large ones would be 12x, and from the small ones 8x.  All together, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.  Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

She had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left. Then she lost half her yellow balloons, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons gone. She had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.  Then she found 8 blue balloons and kept 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Even if she doesn't, there's still a 20% chance he can weasel his way out of it with the dog-ate-my-homework excuse.

So, the only time he *has* to turn it in is if the regular teacher is there AND doesn't give an extension. That's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) times a 100% chance (since he can't get out of it then).

* Kayla has 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests.
* So that's 21 * $6 = $126 for the extra people.
* In total, the party will cost $125 + $126 = $251.

* Train 3: Arrives an hour after Train 2 leaves, leaves right away.
* Train 4: Arrives 20 minutes after Train 3 leaves.

So, Paul will wait a total of 115 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500.  Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

"Wow, that's a lot of jellyfish!  

If each spring makes a new jellyfish every second, and we have 5 springs, that's 5 jellyfish every second.  In an hour, that's 5 * 60 * 60 = 18,000 jellyfish!  

So in 4 hours, they'd make 18,000 * 4 = 72,000 jellyfish.

"Let's see... 10 bunches of bananas at 4 bananas per bunch is 40 bananas total.  If she bought them individually, that would be 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00. Since she bought them in bunches for $3.00 each, it cost her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.  She saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"Let's figure this out! If they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, we can set up a little equation.  Let's say Sam gets ""x"" feet of fence. Harry gets ""x + 60"" feet.  

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Combining the 'x's, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Okay, let's break down Marcel's bike sales. 

He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.

He sold 45 BMX bikes at $250 each (half the price of an MTB), bringing in 45 * $250 = $11,250.

That leaves 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, for a total of 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding all those up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 in sales that month.

"Well, that's easy! If the farmer makes 5 bales an hour and works for 6 hours, that's 5 times 6, or 30 bales. The truck takes away 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 times 6, or 18 bales.  That means there are 30 minus 18, or 12 bales left in the field.

Let's see... if the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors had their fill, then there must have been 540 kg left before those sneaky raptors showed up.  Since that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left behind, the triceratops must have started with a whopping 1080 kg of meat!

"Okay, let's figure out how much paint Tony needs. 

* The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 80 square feet per wall.  
* Since there are two of those walls, that's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.
* The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, or 40 square feet each.
* With two of those walls, that's 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.
* In total, the room has 160 + 80 = 240 square feet of wall space.
* Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.
* At $12 per gallon, the paint will cost 12 * $12 = $144.

He takes 20% of those days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days.

* Frying pan discount: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
* Towel discount: $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

Now, let's find the prices after the discounts:

* Frying pan price: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
* Towel price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 saved annually.

To reach her goal, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

Nik has a lot of crayons!  If he puts 8 crayons in each box, he'll need 25 boxes (200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes).

Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, all the crayons together weigh 200 ounces (200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces).

The boxes also weigh something!  With each box weighing 8 ounces, all the boxes together weigh 200 ounces (25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces).

That means everything together weighs 400 ounces (200 ounces crayons + 200 ounces boxes = 400 ounces).

Finally, we need to convert ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so the total weight is 25 pounds (400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds).

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means he saves $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00.

So, his total cost is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, each day he makes $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower.

Over three days, he'd make $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, that's a total of $26 + $56 = $82 over three days.

That means he sold $82 / $8.01 per sunflower = 10.24 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold **10** sunflowers after 3 days.

"Okay, let me see...

So, Hortex needs to figure out how many more bottles they need to make to cover everyone's energy needs.  

They make 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of your daily energy. That means they're currently covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

They need to cover 100% for 2300 people, which is a total of 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 840% = 229,160%.

Finally, to see how many more bottles they need, we divide the remaining energy needed by the energy per bottle: 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 bottles.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can figure out the length of the red rope.

Here's how I'd solve it:

* **Think about the relationships:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope
   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

* **Use a variable:** Let's say the yellow rope is 'y' centimeters long.

* **Set up an equation:**

   * Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37
   * (4 * Blue rope) + Blue rope + y = 37

* **Substitute:** Since Blue rope = y - 7, we can put that into our equation:

   * (4 * (y - 7)) + (y - 7) + y = 37

* **Solve for y:**

   * 4y - 28 + y - 7 + y = 37
   * 6y - 35 = 37
   * 6y = 72
   * y = 12

* **Find the blue rope:**

   * Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

* **Find the red rope:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope = 4 * 5 = 20



The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  With four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age both now and in the future.  Let's use ""w"" for Wendy's current age and ""c"" for Colin's current age.

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

From the first equation, we know w = 5c + 35.

Let's plug that into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

For veterans, he gives a 25% discount, so he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per hour.  Those 2 veteran lessons earn him 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding those together, Charlie makes a total of $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"Hey there! To find Sally's mean score, we add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

That gives us (50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60) / 9 = 630 / 9 = 70.

"Let's break this down:

* Walter started with 60 apples.
* He ate 24 apples (2/5 of 60).
* That leaves him with 36 apples (60 - 24).
* He gave his sister 9 apples (25% of 36).
* He had 27 apples left (36 - 9).
* He sold those 27 apples for $3 each, earning him $81 (27 * 3).

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year, which is three-quarters of the number she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we can set up a simple equation:

(3/4) * Total novels this year = 9 novels

To solve for the total number of novels this year, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3:

Total novels this year = 9 novels * (4/3) = 12 novels

"
"Hey there!  

Let's see... Michael's driving 50 km/hr for 3 whole days. That's a lot of driving!  

If the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, we need to figure out what part of that he covers.

Hmm, 3 days is 72 hours (3 x 24).  So he drives 3600 km in total (50 x 72).

To find the percentage, we divide the distance he drives by the total distance and multiply by 100. That's 3600 divided by 6000, times 100, which equals 60%.

So Michael covers 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes used already.  

Since their mom used 12 grapes per pie for 4 pies, she used 12 * 4 = 48 grapes.

Adding those together, they started with 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Bud spends $1 on pasta, $3 on cheddar, and $6 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar cost). That's a total of $10 per week.

Over a year, with 52 weeks, he spends $10/week * 52 weeks = $520.00 on his cheesy pasta.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

If they have 80 classrooms to clean and it takes 15 minutes per classroom, that's 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work an 8-hour day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes total.

So, cleaning takes up 1200 / 2400 = 0.5 or 50% of their workday.

"
"Let's see... each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books.  That's a total of 55 books per bookcase (10 + 10 + 20 + 15).  Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 2 bookcases.

"
"Okay, let's figure out Rose's profit.  

She spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozen eggs, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.

She's selling them in groups of 3 for $1.00 each, and she has 60 eggs (5 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen). That means she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets of eggs.

Selling 20 sets at $1.00 each gives her 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Her profit is her earnings minus her costs: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Let's break it down:

* Skyler starts with 100 hats.
* Half are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.
* That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are either blue or white.
*  3/5 of those are blue, meaning there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
* The rest must be white, so he has 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).

That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"
"Okay, so Mary made 116 ice cubes total. Let's see... she made some strawberry cubes, and then 5 times that number minus 4 for blueberry cubes.  Hmm, to figure out the blueberry cubes, we need to know how many strawberry cubes she made first.  

Let's say she made 's' strawberry cubes. That means she made 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  

If we add those together, we get the total: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining the 's' terms, we have 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that s = 20. So she made 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we plug that back into our equation: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Hmm, let me see.  If the new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting and she has 6 paintings, that's 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.  Her old varnish would have taken 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

"Let's figure out how much water Crista needs!

* The plants needing half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.
* The plants needing a full cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups of water.
* That leaves 8 plants that need a quarter cup each, so that's 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water every day.

"Well, let's see... Phineas has a 200-yard journey home. Since half is on land and half is in water, that's 100 yards of hopping and 100 yards of swimming.

He hops at 20 yards a minute, so that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming is slower, at 10 yards a minute, so that's 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those together, it'll take Phineas 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

The boat loses 30% of its value the first year, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. That means it's worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The second year it loses another 30%, or $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So now it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year it loses 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  That leaves it worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

"Okay, so the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on the $80 he spent. That means he wants to make an extra $20 ($80 x 0.25 = $20).  

So, he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100 total ($80 + $20 = $100).

If he sells all 50 watermelons for $100, each one would cost $2 ($100 / 50 = $2).

"Okay, let's break this down. Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the youngest son is 5. In three years, he'll be 8.

"Let's see... Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  

Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's see... 20 animals with 70 legs... hmm.  

If all the animals were chickens, they'd only have 40 legs. So there have to be some cows in there.  

Let me think... if we take away 2 legs for each cow and add a chicken, we'd have the same number of animals but fewer legs.

Okay, I got it! There are **5** chickens.

"Let's see... 7 pizzas times 8 slices per pizza is 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, they each get 14 slices.
