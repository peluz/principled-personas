"Hey there! Flipping houses can be tricky, but it sounds like Josh did a great job!  

Here's how to figure out his profit:

* The house went up in value by 150% of its original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.
* That means after the repairs, it's worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
*  His total costs were $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.
* So, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hmm, let's see... Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups.  Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them 60 cups in total.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Let's break down the cost:

* Since every second glass is 60% off, Kylar gets a deal on half of the glasses.
* He's buying 16 glasses, so that's 8 pairs.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 equals a total of 260 sheep.

* Month 2 had three times the downloads of month 1: 60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads
* Month 3 had 30% fewer downloads than month 2: 180 downloads * 0.30 = 54 downloads less
* So month 3 had: 180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads
* Total downloads: 60 downloads + 180 downloads + 126 downloads = 366 downloads

"Let's break this down!  If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more.  

Think of it like this:

* She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That means the 5 she has left are what's left *after* selling to the orange house.

Since she sold half her remaining vacuums at the orange house, she must have had double that amount before.

So, 5 x 2 = 10.

But remember, that 10 is what she had *before* the orange house!

She sold 2 at the red house, so before that she had 10 + 2 = 12.

And before the green house, she had three times that amount, so 12 x 3 = 36.

"To figure out Marissa's needed speed, we can think about it like this:

She wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile hike.  That means she needs to finish in 3 hours (12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours).

She's already hiked for 2 hours, so she only has 1 hour left (3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour).

To finish the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour (6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour).

Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  There are 18 parts total (7 + 11). Each ""part"" represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hey there!  Sylvie's salary will be $798.60 after three more years. Here's how I figured that out:

* Each year, her salary goes up by 10% of what it was before.
* So, after one year, it'll be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660.
* Then the next year, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.
* And finally, after three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60.

"Hey there!  Let's break down this salary situation.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's to start, and we know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, we can figure out Lylah's starting salary.  

If Adrien's salary represents 130% of Lylah's (100% + 30%), then Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 four years ago.

Fast forward four years, and Adrien's salary jumped by 40%, meaning he earned an extra $40,000 * 0.40 = $16,000.  His new salary is $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so she earned an extra $30,769.23 * 0.40 = $12,307.69. Her new salary is $30,769.23 + $12,307.69 = $43,076.92.

"Let's figure this out!

Sally Four is 8 years old because she's the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, so she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Adding up their ages, we get 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51 years.

"Hey there!  

Let's break down Jessica's debt payments. Her minimum payments add up to $1000 per month. If she wants to pay 50% more, that's an extra $500 each month. So, her total monthly payment would be $1500. Over a year, that comes out to $18000.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It takes Billy a minute and a half to peel each potato, and that's 90 minutes for all 60 potatoes (60 x 1.5 = 90).  Cutting them is much faster, only 5 seconds each, so that's 5 minutes total (300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 5).

Adding the peeling and cutting time together, it'll take Billy 95 minutes to get all those potatoes ready (90 + 5 = 95).

"Lemonade stands are so much fun!  

To figure out how much they spent on lemons, we need to think about how much profit they made per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so that's $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, it costs them $5 to make each gallon ($3 + $2 = $5).

That means they make a profit of $5 per gallon ($10 - $5 = $5).

They made a total profit of $25, so they must have sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5 gallons).

Finally, since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, they spent $15 on lemons in total (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers bigger than 3 on a die (4, 5, and 6), so there's a 50% chance of rolling one. To get two even numbers in a row, you need an even number on the first roll (50% chance) AND another even number on the second roll (another 50% chance). That means a 25% chance of getting two evens.

So, rolling a number bigger than 3 is 25% more likely.

If each of the 20 stalls gets the same number of new cows, and there are 40 new cows, then each stall gets 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 new cows.

That means each stall now has 20 cows + 2 cows = 22 cows.

So, 8 stalls would have 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows.

"Let's break this down!

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together they have a total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Hi there!  To figure out how much flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many dozens of cookies she's making. She's baking 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, for a total of 66 cookies. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, she's making 66 / 12 = 5.5 dozen cookies.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much more the house costs than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 is $17,500.

Then, the transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 is $42,000.

Adding those together, the total extra costs are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500.

So, the total price of the house is $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Finally,  $409,500 minus Mrs. Cruz's $400,000 budget means the house is $9,500 over budget.

"Hi there!  

Let's figure out Mr. Tan's net proceeds.  

First, we need to find out how much he paid in fees:

* Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000 = $12,000
* Brokerage fees: 5% of $400,000 = $20,000
* Total fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

Now, add the remaining loan amount to his fees:

* Total expenses: $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

Finally, subtract his total expenses from the selling price:

* Net proceeds: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000

"Okay, so it takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then 40% longer to get to 400 degrees. That means it takes an extra 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.

So, the total heating time is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, from starting the oil to finishing cooking, it takes 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

* Cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots
* Mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 200 students, so: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Let's solve for x:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

So, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"
"Let's see... 60 animals, twice as many chickens as cows...  

Okay, so if we think of the chickens and cows as groups, there are three groups in total.  Since there are twice as many chickens, the chickens make up two of those groups, and the cows make up one. That means there are 60 animals / 3 groups = 20 animals in each group.

So there are 20 cows and 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2. That means the cows have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs. The chickens have 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.

All together, that's 80 + 80 = 160 legs!

"Let's see... Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 each week for 4 weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.  He drops 3, but 2 come back, so he's left with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.

"Ribbit! That's easy!  If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and all the other animals weigh the same as the frog or close to it, we can figure out the total weight.

Let's see... the blue beetle and green toad are the same as the frog, so they're 50 pounds each. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, so it's 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds! So the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"Hey there!  

So Tyson needs to run more, huh?  Okay, let's see... if he runs 5000 meters a day and his coach wants him to run 1/5 more, that's an extra 1000 meters (5000 x 1/5 = 1000).

That means he'll be running 6000 meters each day (5000 + 1000 = 6000).

In June, with 30 days, that's a total of 180,000 meters (6000 x 30 = 180,000).

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find the total time, we can divide 15 hours by 0.30, which equals 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles every day.

To figure out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service miles by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so those will cost 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords. Those cords cost $12 each, for a total of 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Now, add the interest to the original loan amount:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months:

* Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
* Monthly payment = $5475 / 5 = $1095

* James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.
* Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

Each bag has 2 cubic feet of soil, so he'll need 160 bags (320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags).

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she runs for 1 hour, so that's 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

"Let's break this down!  

If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones, we can think of the blue jelly beans as our starting point.

Since the total is 4500, let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans. That means there are 0.99x red jelly beans and 1.01x green jelly beans.

Adding those all together: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms: 3x = 4500

So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

"Wow, that's a long street!  Let's see... repaving costs $194 per meter, and Lewis' street is 490 meters long. So, it would cost $194 * 490 = $95060.  Monica's street is only 150 meters, so repaving that costs $194 * 150 = $29100.  That means Lewis' street costs $95060 - $29100 = $65960 more to repave.

"Okay, let's calculate the total cost of John's research.

* He starts with $100,000 per month for 5 months, totaling $500,000.
* The project takes 10 times longer, meaning 50 months in total.
* That's 45 months with increased funding.
* Each of those months costs 50% more, so $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.50) = $150,000.
* The increased funding period costs 45 months * $150,000/month = $6,750,000.
* Adding the initial and increased funding periods, the total cost is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

"Hey there!  

To figure out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a little conversion.

First, we know there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb. So, her speed of 20 kb per second is equal to 0.02 Mb per second (20 / 1000 = 0.02).

Next, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 * 60 = 3600).

Finally, to get her speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

"Hey there!  

Let's break down James' earnings.  

First, we figure out how much the company spent on the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000. Then, we see how much they paid to get those cars: $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

Next, we find the total money made from selling all the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.  Subtract the cost to get the profit: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets 10% of that profit: $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

* Let's say each triplet is 'r' years old.
* One twin is 'r + 7' years old.
* Since there are two twins and three triplets, the total age is 2(r + 7) + 3r = 44

Now we can solve for 'r':

* 2r + 14 + 3r = 44
* 5r + 14 = 44
* 5r = 30

So each triplet is 6 years old.  That means one of the twins is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

"Let's count up all the squares!

* Brittany has 18 blue squares (14 red + 4 more).
* She has 24 green squares (18 blue + 6 more).
* She has 12 white squares (24 green - 12).

That's a total of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

* Marta collected triple Tom's points, giving her 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points for the trip, so they're still missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

It cost him $20 to get in and then $1.50 for each pound of blueberries. Since he picked 30 pounds, that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 for the blueberries themselves.

So, in total, he spent $45 + $20 = $65 at the farm.

Since he bought 17 fish, and we know he ended up with twice as many orange as white,  he must have bought 4 white fish.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure out Andy's weekly gas cost. He drives 10 miles each day to work and back home (5 miles one way * 2). That's 50 miles for the whole week (10 miles/day * 5 days/week).

Since his car gets 10 miles per gallon, he'll use 5 gallons of gas each week (50 miles / 10 MPG).

At $3 per gallon, his weekly fuel cost is $15 (5 gallons * $3/gallon).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Samwell sold 40 TVs total, and we know the fractions for smart and analog, we can find the OLEDs.

* Smart TVs: 40 TVs * (1/4) = 10 TVs
* Analog TVs: 40 TVs * (1/8) = 5 TVs
* That means 10 + 5 = 15 TVs were smart or analog.
*  So, 40 TVs - 15 TVs = 25 TVs must be OLEDs!

"Hmm, let's see... Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, and the same amount of salt as sugar.  She also uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.  

Since she fills a 10-ounce jar, we can figure out how much of each ingredient she uses.  

If we let the zest be represented by ""z"", then the fragrance is also ""z"". The salt and sugar are each twice the amount of zest, so they are both ""2z"". The oil is twice the amount of salt, making it ""4z"".

Adding all that up: z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10 ounces.

That means 10z = 10 ounces, so z = 1 ounce.

Since the oil is 4z, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much jello Greg needs.  

He needs enough for 30 kids to have 4 cups each, so that's 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes.

If each box costs $1.25, then 12 boxes will cost 12 * $1.25 = $15.00.

*  Each apple pack costs half the price of a strawberry pack, so each apple pack is $4 / 2 = $2.
*  The apples cost a total of $2 * 7 = $14.
*  The strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding up all the costs, Kelly spends $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one, so there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of day one. That doesn't make sense, so maybe the map was a bit off!  Anyway, they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on day four.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

If Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, and together they caught 339 Pokemon, we can use some algebra to solve for Stan's catch.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon. That means Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.  

We also know Alex caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex caught 4A - 13 + 5, or 4A - 8 Pokemon.

Adding up all their catches, we get: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Combining like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9: A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now we can find Stan's catch: 4 * 40 - 13 = 147



Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants in total.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 28 more (45 - 17 = 28).

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights to Greece.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

"Let's break this down!

If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones cost $4, then large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"It'll take Jim 4 years to earn back what he spent on college and the income he missed out on. 

Here's how I figured that out:

* He borrowed $50,000 each year for four years, so that's $50,000 * 4 = $200,000 in loans.
* He was making $25,000 a year before college, and his degree triples his income to $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.
* While he was in school, he missed out on earning $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.
* In total, he needs to earn back $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.
* Since he now makes $75,000 per year, it will take him $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

"Hi there!  To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we need to think about the size of the comforter. Since it needs to be bigger than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and width.

* The bed is 6 feet long, so the fabric needs to be 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 feet long.
* The bed is 8 feet wide, so the fabric needs to be 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 feet wide.

To find the total fabric needed, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, so that's (102 * 2) + 5 = 209 letters.

"Let's figure this out!  

If the third person got twice what the second person got, and the second person got $80 more than the first, we can use some algebra. Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.

* Second person: x + $80
* Third person: 2 * (x + $80) = 2x + $160

Adding it all up: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtracting $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Dividing both sides by 4: x = $420

The first person got $420.

"Let's figure this out!  If Rory got half as many balls in the third set as the second, and the total is 19, we know the second set must have been a pretty good chunk of that.  

Let's say the second set was 'x' balls. That means the third set was x/2 balls.  

So, the first set was x + 4 balls.

Adding those all together: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

So, the second set was 6 balls.

That means the first set was 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

Elijah's first dog weighs 1/4 of Kory's 60-pound dog, so that's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"Hi!  Let's figure this out.  

If Nik has 200 crayons and puts 8 in each box, he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25). That means he has 25 boxes weighing 8 ounces each, for a total of 200 ounces just for the boxes (25 x 8 = 200).

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too (200 crayons x 1 ounce each = 200 ounces).

So, all together, the crayons and boxes weigh 400 ounces (200 + 200 = 400).

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 25 pounds (400 / 16 = 25).

Over 3 days, he earns $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from single sunflowers and $56 from bouquets (totaling $82), he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers.

"Let's break this problem down.

* Wendy's age now is ""w""
* Colin's age now is ""c""

From the problem, we get these clues:

* **Clue 1:** Wendy's age now is five times what Colin's age will be in seven years. That means w = 5(c + 7)
* **Clue 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be one-third Wendy's age now. This means c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can use these clues to solve for Colin's current age (""c"").

First, let's solve Clue 1 for ""w"":

* w = 5c + 35

Now, let's plug that value of ""w"" into Clue 2:

* c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Let's simplify and solve for ""c"":

* c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* (3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
* 75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

* On the second day, he planted 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, so that's 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.
* In total, he planted 60 trees on the first day and 80 trees on the second day.

That means he planted a grand total of 140 trees!

Since there were 4 people at the party, they each get 8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons each.

"Hmm, let's see...  There are 66 fish in total. One-third have red stripes, so that's 66 / 3 = 22 fish. That leaves 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.  

Now, 5 out of every 11 of those fish have blue stripes, so that's (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.

In total, there are 22 + 20 = 42 fish with red or blue stripes.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we need to find out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar.  The jar is a rectangular prism, so we multiply the length, width, and height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, so we need to account for that.  They're about 80% efficient, meaning they only fill up 80% of the space. So, the usable space is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red, so he'd guess there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The real number is 900, so Tim was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans.

"Hmm, let me see...  

So the bus started with 20 people, then picked up 40 more, and then another 30. That's 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

After the third stop, there were double that amount, so 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out how much Pauline spent.

She goes to the museum 3 times a year, and that costs her $2 per visit, so she spends 3 * $2 = $6 each year.

Over 5 years, that's $6/year * 5 years = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which means it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3.

The new price is $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5/visit * 3 visits/year * 3 years = $45.

In total, Pauline spent $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Let's break this down! If the longer piece is 4 times bigger than the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being split into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Since the whole board is 40 feet long, each of those parts is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of those parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

If the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, we need to figure out what part of that distance he covers.

Hmm, 3 days is 72 hours (3 x 24 = 72).  

So he travels 3600 km in total (50 x 72 = 3600).

To find the percentage, we divide the distance he traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100.

All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116 cubes.

Combining the 's' cubes, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

"Hi!  Let's figure out how much John needs to spend. He needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more.  Each pack has 6 hot dogs, so he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs. If each pack costs $2, then he'll spend 6 * $2 = $12.

"That's easy!  

Here's how it works:

* On the second street, there are 5 * 2 = 10 kids.
* On the third street, there are 10 * 2 = 20 kids.
* Then 5 kids leave, so there are 20 - 5 = 15 kids left.

"Let's see... Mamou started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  

That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left.

"That's easy! A quarter is worth 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  

Let's add it all up: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

"Let's add up their ages! The older brother is 24, the younger brother is 12, and the three sisters are each 16, so that's 16 + 16 + 16 = 48 years for the sisters.  In total, all the siblings are 24 + 12 + 48 = 84 years old.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day, and that's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for 300 minutes a week. So in total, that's 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, that adds up to 2040 minutes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how big Octavia's quilt will be.

*  Those small shirts add up to 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
* The medium shirts are 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
* And the large shirts make 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Adding those all together, the quilt will be 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet!

"A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, which has 3 dozen seeds. That means the large sunflower has 36 + (36 * 0.50) = 54 seeds.  

Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out. If George has 18 pens and Timothy has three times that amount, Timothy has 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

"Let's figure this out!

Anne is twice Albert's height, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall.

Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.

Before summer, Jackie was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall.

"That's easy! If they make 5000 bars a day and sell them for $2 each, they make $10,000 per day.  Over a week, that's $70,000.  So in two weeks, they'd make $140,000.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

* Those T-shirts are a good deal! Since one is half off, he pays $4 for the second one. That means the total for the shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

* The shoes are also on sale, so he saves $16 on them ($40 x 0.40 = $16).  He pays $24 for the shoes ($40 - $16 = $24).

* Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18.  The ice cream cost $1.25 each for him and his three friends, so that's $1.25 x 4 = $5.  He has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hi there!  Let's figure out Tim's profit.

Okay, so each jar costs $44 to make (that's $12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey). He sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of $6 per jar.

If he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be $60.

"Let's count Randy's cookies!

He starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18. After his snack, he has 16 left. Then he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, leaving him with 14.  Giving away 2 sugar cookies brings his total down to 12. Finally, baking 4 of each kind adds 12 more cookies, for a grand total of 24!

"
"Let's see... half of 12 toys is 6.  If he sells 6 for $5 each, that's 6 * $5 = $30. The other 6 for $7 each is 6 * $7 = $42.  Adding those together, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's see... Igor brought 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and we know he had 29 items total.  That means he must have brought 29 - 8 - 16 = 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"Let's add up how much everyone raised!

* Alexandra raised $430.
* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raised $300.
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

In total, they raised $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Hi there!  

Let's figure out how much each watermelon sold for.  

If the vendor made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons that cost him $80, he earned an extra $20 (25% of $80). That means he sold all the watermelons for $100 ($80 + $20).

To find the price of each watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons: $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's break this down:

* Dora is turning 12 in 3 years, so she's currently 9 years old.
* James is twice Dora's age, making him 18.
* John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37.
* John's youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is 5 years old.
* In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Hmm, let's see... Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  If they both work for a whole hour, that's 60 minutes.  

Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.

Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there!  Sounds like Mark got a great deal on that radiator!

"
"Let's see... 20 animals with 70 legs... hmm.  If all the animals were chickens, they'd only have 40 legs. So there must be some cows in there too.  

Since cows have 4 legs, each cow adds 2 extra legs compared to a chicken.  We need 30 extra legs (70 - 40 = 30), which means there must be 15 cows (30 / 2 = 15).

That leaves 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).
