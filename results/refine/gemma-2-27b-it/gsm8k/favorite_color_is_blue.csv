"That's a great question!  Flipping houses can be tricky, but it can also be very profitable.  

Here's how to figure out Josh's profit:

* First, you need to find out how much the house was worth after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, that means the house is now worth 250% of its original value (100% + 150% = 250%).
* Multiply the original price by 2.5 to find the new value: $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000
* Now subtract his total investment (the original price plus the cost of repairs) from the final value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000

"Let's break this problem down.  Melanie ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners.  Before the orange house, she had 2 more than that, or 7.  

Double that amount, since she sold half to the orange house, gives us 14.  That means she had 14 + the 2 she sold to the red house, or 16, before the red house.

Finally, tripling that amount (since she sold a third at the green house) gives us 48.  

So Melanie started with 48 vacuum cleaners.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

If 20% of the students are doing contemporary, that's 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.

That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then 25% of those students are into jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are doing hip-hop.

So, 12 students out of 20 are hip-hop dancers, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning for every 7 years Darrell ages, Allen ages 11. Their combined age is 162.

To find Allen's age in 10 years, we first need to figure out their current ages.  We can do this by thinking of their age ratio as parts of a whole.

* **Total ratio parts:** 7 + 11 = 18
* **Value of one ratio part:** 162 / 18 = 9

Now we can find each person's age:

* **Darrell's age:** 7 * 9 = 63
* **Allen's age:** 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10:

* **Allen's age in 10 years:** 99 + 10 = 109

"Let's break this problem down.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's call this number ""x""
* **Gold coins:** This would be ""x + 30""

Since she has 110 coins total, we can add those together: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Finally, dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70

So, to find out Harald's sales, we divide the total copies by the total parts: 88,000 copies / 11 parts = 8,000 copies per part.

Harald sold 8,000 copies.

* Height: 2 inches

Now we multiply those together to find the volume of one box: 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago, so that's our starting point.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which is a $16,000 increase ($40,000 x 0.40 = $16,000). This brings his salary to $56,000.

Since their salaries increased at the same rate, Lylah's salary also went up by 40%.  Her initial salary was $30,769.23 (because $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23), and a 40% increase on that is $12,307.69 ($30,769.23 x 0.40 = $12,307.69).

Adding the increase to her original salary, Lylah is now making $43,076.92.

Finally, to find their combined salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92

We know Seth is twice Brooke's age, and in two years, they'll add up to 28 years old.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say:

That means 3 * (Brooke's age in two years) = 28

So, Brooke's age in two years is 28 / 3 = 9.33 years old.

Since we want to know Brooke's current age, we subtract 2 years: 9.33 - 2 = 7.33 years old.

"Lemonade stands are a classic!  

Here's how to figure out how much they spent on lemons:

* Each gallon costs $5 to make ($3 for lemons + $2 for sugar).
* They made $25 profit, and make $5 profit per gallon, so they sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5).
* Since each gallon uses $3 worth of lemons, they spent a total of $15 on lemons (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).

Adding up all his expenses (rent, fuel, donation, daughter's allowance, and wife's money), we get $3500 + $1250 + $200 + $700 = $5650.

Since he earns $6000, he has $6000 - $5650 = $350 left.

"Let's break this down.  We know Jerry gets 42 eggs every day. Those eggs come from both his red chickens (3 eggs each) and his white chickens (5 eggs each). He also has two more white chickens than red chickens.  

To figure out how many red chickens he has, we can use a little algebra. Let's say 'r' is the number of red chickens. Since he has two more white chickens, there are 'r + 2' white chickens.

Now, the total eggs from the red chickens are 3r, and the total eggs from the white chickens are 5(r + 2).  

We know the total eggs are 42, so we can set up an equation: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Let's solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"Blue is such a calming color, don't you think?  

Anyway, let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is due to how much they had to start with.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the big pool lost less water in those four minutes. This makes sense because it started with more.

Thinking about it this way, the small pool must have lost a significant amount of water in those four minutes.  

If we work backward, we can figure out that the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, which is 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, so it needs 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

"Let's break this problem down.  

Imagine the 200 students divided into three groups. Two of the groups are the same size, and the third group is a bit smaller.  

If we take away 10 students from the two larger groups, we'd have enough to make the smaller group. That means the two larger groups combined have 10 more students than the smaller group.

Since the two larger groups are equal, each of them has 5 more students than the smaller group.

Now, let's think about the total. If we add up the students in all three groups, we get 200.

Let 'x' be the number of students in the smaller group.

* The two larger groups have x + 5 students each.

So, the total number of students is: x + (x + 5) + (x + 5) = 200

Combining like terms: 3x + 10 = 200

Subtracting 10 from both sides: 3x = 190

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 63.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we need to adjust our thinking.  It seems like there might be a slight error in the way the problem is set up.

"This is a classic animal problem!  Here's how to figure it out:

* **Let's use some algebra:**

Let 'c' be the number of cows and 'h' be the number of chickens. We know:

* c + h = 60 (total animals)
* h = 2c (twice as many chickens as cows)

* **Solve for the number of each animal:**

Substitute the second equation into the first: c + 2c = 60
Combine like terms: 3c = 60
Divide both sides by 3: c = 20 cows
Since h = 2c, there are h = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

* **Count the legs:**

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

* **Total legs:**

All together, the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's break down John's vacation time!

He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours.  He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours. That's 15 hours in total for those activities.

We know those activities make up 30% of his vacation.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

"Let's figure out how much more money Annabelle needs!

She wants a $400 phone and already has $80. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Her first job will earn her $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

Her second job will earn her $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

"That's a classic distance problem!  

Let's see... the train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles one way. Coming back, it travels 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles. That means a full round trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

To figure out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total service mileage by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

* The total etching cost is 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.
* There are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers who need cords.
* The cords cost $12 each, so that's 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

"Let's break down this loan problem.  

To find out Karan's monthly payment, we need to figure out the total amount she'll repay and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the interest:

* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Next, we add the interest to the original loan amount:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

She'll make $36 if she sells it all (36 cups * $1/cup).

After buying supplies, her profit is $18 ($36 - $18).

"That's a classic geometry problem!  Here's how to solve it:

* **Find the width:** We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet (since 3 yards is equal to 9 feet).  Area is length times width, so the width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

* **Calculate the perimeter:** The perimeter is the total distance around the room. It's found with the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  So, the perimeter is 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

"Let's break down this triathlon timing puzzle!

* Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

* James is 10% faster in the swim, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

* James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, for a total of 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

* Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

*  That means James's run time is 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

Think of it like this: if we took away those 7 years from the older twin, we'd have a group where everyone is the same age.  

Let's say the triplets are each 'r' years old. That means one twin is 'r + 7' years old, and the other twin is also 'r + 7' years old.

So, the total age of the group would be: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

Combining like terms: 5r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

That means each triplet is 6 years old.  

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

They formed 10 groups in total (90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups).

Three-fifths of those groups brought back seashells, which is 6 groups (3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups).

Each of those groups brought back 18 seashells (2 seashells per person * 9 people per group = 18 seashells per group).

So in total, they brought back 108 seashells (6 groups * 18 seashells per group = 108 seashells).

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes per quarter.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His not-so-good friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.
* His good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

That's a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

If we let the zest be represented by ""1 piece,"" then the fragrance is also ""1 piece."" The salt would be ""2 pieces"" (twice the zest), the sugar is also ""2 pieces,"" and the oil is ""4 pieces"" (twice the salt).

Adding all the pieces together: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, we need to calculate it for the small and large masks separately. 

For the small masks, she uses 0.5 yards per mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask).  Since she wants to make 20 small masks, she'll need 10 yards (20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards).

For the large masks, she uses 0.75 yards per mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask). For 8 large masks, she'll need 6 yards (8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards).

Adding those together, Jo will need a total of 16 yards of material (10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards).

"Let's break this problem down. We know the three ages add up to 100.  Paul is older than John by 10 years, and Peter's age is the total of Paul's and John's ages.

Think of it like this:

*  John's age + 10 = Paul's age
*  John's age + Paul's age = Peter's age

If we add all three ages together, we get:

John's age + (John's age + 10) + (John's age + John's age + 10) = 100

Simplifying that:

4 * John's age + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4 * John's age = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

John's age = 20

Now we know John is 20.  Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages, and Paul is 10 years older than John, Peter must be 20 + 30 = 50 years old.

"Blue's my favorite color, but when it comes to widgets, green is where the money's at!  

Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a whole month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 an hour, or 45 * 24 = 1080 a day. That's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets in a month.

Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 makes 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 brings in 32400 * $6 = $194400.

The difference? $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

Fern will make $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

If we think of the points as a big blue puzzle, we know Bahati has the biggest piece.  Azibo's piece is smaller than Bahati's by 20 points, and Dinar's is even smaller than Azibo's by 10 points.  

Since they scored a total of 45 points, we can use some math to find out how many points Azibo scored.

Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.
* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Adding all their points together: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5



Azibo scored 5 points.

"This is a classic system of equations problem!  Here's how to solve it:

Let's use 'A' for Adelwolfe's Pokemon, 'S' for Stan's, and 'X' for Alex's.

* We know S = 4A - 13 
* We also know X = S + 5
* And finally, A + S + X = 339

Let's plug in the first two equations into the third one:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplify that:

A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339

Combine like terms:

9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

A = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Let's plug that back into the equation for Stan:

S = 4(40) - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147

The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so the total length is (15 * 2) + (10 * 2) = 30 + 20 = 50 feet.

Since he needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, he'll need 50 * 2 = 100 slats.

* That's a total of 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

* On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her first day's amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her first day's amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.
* That's a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

* Altogether, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

"This problem is all about percentages!  

Think of it like this: the power bank lost some juice, then some more, and ended up with 28% left.  We need to work backwards to figure out how much it had to start with.

Let's see... it lost 6% while charging her friends' phones, and that was after already losing 66% from the initial drain.  So, before charging her friends' phones, it had 34% left (28% + 6%).

If 34% represents what was left after losing 66%, we can figure out the original amount. It's like a puzzle!

34% is what's left after losing 66%, so the original amount must have been 100%.

We can set up a proportion to solve for the original charge:

6% / 34% = x / 100%

Solving for x, we get:

x = (6% * 100%) / 34% = 17.65% (approximately)

"Let's break this down.  

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and she made $120 total, we know the small ones are a big part of her sales.  She sold twice as many small as large, so if we figure out how many large she sold, we can find the number of small ones.

Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small ones.

Large ones cost $12 each (3 * $4), so she made 12x dollars from those.

Small ones cost $4 each, so she made 8x dollars from those (4 * 2x).

Adding those together, her total earnings are 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

*  We know the total number of balls is 19.
*  Let's use 'x' for the number of balls in the second set.

The first set had 4 more balls than the second, so that's x + 4. The third set had half the number of the second set, which is x / 2.

Adding all the sets together: (x + 4) + x + (x / 2) = 19

Now we can solve for x!

1. Combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
3. Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, the second set had 6 balls.

The first set had x + 4 balls, which is 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Let's break this down. Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, each sunflower, whether sold individually or in a bouquet, brings in $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he makes $2.67 per sunflower * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made a total of $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days, he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold 30 sunflowers after 3 days.

"Let's break this down!  

If Carly needs 10 treats total and each person gets two, she's making enough for 5 people.  

Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) treats. We know that equals 10.

So, c + 3c - 2 = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4 gives us c = 3.

Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Let's break this down. If Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 fewer than Shelley, then Shelley must have 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.

"That's a classic percentage problem!  Here's how to figure it out:

* **December Price:** The toy cost $40 + (80% of $40) = $40 + $32 = $72
* **January Price:** The price dropped by 50% of $72, which is $36. So the January price was $72 - $36 = $36.

"Let's break down Charlie's earnings:

* He earns $80 for each of his regular lessons, and he has 4 of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.
* For veterans, he charges $80 - ($80 * 0.25) = $60 per hour.
*  He has 2 veteran lessons at $60 each, totaling 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding his earnings from both types of lessons, Charlie makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.

"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to think about how many she needs in total.  She needs to get 70% of all the questions right, and there are 110 questions total (70 + 40).

So, she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

"Ooh, blueberries!  Those are my favorite.  

Let's see... if she made 116 cubes total, and the blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, we can figure this out.  

If we let 's' be the number of strawberry cubes, then the blueberry cubes are 5s - 4.  

All the cubes together are s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining the 's' cubes, we get 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find s = 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.

"That's a classic markup problem!  

Here's how to figure out the selling price:

* **Find the total profit:** 25% of $80 is $20.
* **Calculate the total selling price:** The vendor made a $20 profit, so they sold all the watermelons for $80 + $20 = $100.
* **Divide to find the price per watermelon:** $100 divided by 50 watermelons equals $2 per watermelon.

"Let's break this down. Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the youngest son is 5. In three years, he'll be 8.

"Ana peels oranges faster than Jane, so after an hour she'll have peeled more.  

Here's how to figure out how many more:

* **Ana's oranges:** She peels one orange every 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes she'll peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges.
* **Jane's oranges:** She peels one orange every 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes she'll peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

* **The difference:** Ana peels 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"This is a classic system of equations problem!  Let's break it down:

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20 (total animals)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

Solving for 'c', we find there are **5** chickens.
