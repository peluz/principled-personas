"Let's break this problem down. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information:

* Let 's' be the number of silver coins.
* Let 'g' be the number of gold coins.

We know:

1. s + g = 110 (The total number of coins is 110)
2. g = s + 30 (There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for 's':

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can plug that value back into the second equation to find the number of gold coins:

g = 40 + 30

"Let 'w' be the number of games won and 'l' be the number of games lost. We're given the following system of equations:

* w + l = 22

"Let's break down this beehive population problem.  We can set up a system of equations to represent the relationships given:

* Let  'q' be the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' be the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' be the number of worker bees.

We know:

* q + b + w = 700 (Total bees)
* b = 2q (Twice as many babies as queens)
* w = 2b (Twice as many workers as babies)

Substituting the second equation into the third, we get: w = 2 * (2q) = 4q.

Now, substitute both 'b' and 'w' in terms of 'q' into the first equation: q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms: 7q = 700

Solving for 'q': q = 100

Since w = 4q, then w = 4 * 100 = 400.

"Let's work backward to solve this problem.

* We know 5 fries were left after the ants took one. This means there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries before the ants, leaving one-third, which is 6 fries. This means there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.
* The pigeons ate a total of 9 fries, leaving 18 fries. This means there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before the pigeons.
* The seagull ate half the fries Dave ate, meaning Dave ate twice the amount the seagull did.  Since the seagull ate 7 fries, Dave ate 7 * 2 = 14 fries.

"Here's how to calculate the final price:

The price of the marbles increases by 20% every two months. This means the price will compound over time.  

* **After 2 months:** $20 + (0.20 * $20) = $24
* **After 4 months:** $24 + (0.20 * $24) = $28.80
* **After 6 months:** $28.80 + (0.20 * $28.80) = $34.56

We can see a pattern here.  To find the price after 36 months (18 two-month periods), we can use the formula for compound interest:

Final Price = Initial Price * (1 + Rate)^Number of Periods

Final Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20)^18 
Final Price = $20 * (1.20)^18
Final Price ≈ $92.00

We know the following:

*  w = r + 2 (two more white chickens than red chickens)
* 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs collected)

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

"Let's break down this problem. We know both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  

Let 'S' represent the current amount of water in the small pool and 'B' represent the current amount in the big pool.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool, which can be expressed as:

B + 16 = 2(S + 16)

Currently, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool:

B = 4S

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first:

4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)

Simplifying this equation:

4S + 16 = 2S + 32
2S = 16
S = 8


Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

"Let's set up a system of equations to represent this problem. 

* Let 'c' be the number of camels.
* Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

We know:

* Each animal has one head: c + d = 180
* Camels have two humps, dromedaries have one: 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries) using elimination.  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

c = 124

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

124 + d = 180

Therefore:

"Let's break this problem down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and has $50 left over for spending money after selling his cards. This means he earned $50 from the sale.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 per card = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell fractions of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 1/3 of his collection is 33 cards / 2 = 16.5 cards. Again, we can't have half a card, so we'll round down.

Therefore, he started with 33 cards (sold) + 16 cards (kept) = 49 cards.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

We know the total number of insects found is 43. Let's use variables to represent the number of insects each person found:

*  Bodhi: B
*  David: D
*  Lily: L

We're given the following relationships:

*  L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
*  D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to get:

L = (B / 2) + 7

Now, substitute both of these equations into the equation representing the total number of insects:

(B / 2) + 7 + (B / 2) + B = 43

Simplifying the equation:

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find David's total:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Lily's total:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

"Let's use a system of equations to solve this classic animal problem.

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.

"Let's break down the costs:

* The vaccines cost $20 each, totaling $40.
* The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, meaning it costs 0.60 * (total bill).
* We know the heartworm check cost is also $24.

Let 'x' represent the total bill. We can set up an equation: 0.60x = $24

Solving for x: x = $24 / 0.60 = $40

Therefore, the total bill is $40 (vaccines) + $24 (heartworm check) = $64.

Since John brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $64 = $61.

* First, calculate the number of people who favor horse #2: 20% of 50 people is (20/100) * 50 = 10 people.

* This leaves 50 - 10 = 40 people.

*  Of those remaining, 60% support horse #7, which is (60/100) * 40 = 24 people.

*  Therefore, 40 - 24 = 16 people believe horse #12 will win.

"Let's break down this shingle problem:

*  We know the total shingles needed across all three houses is 250 cases.
*  Let's use 'x' to represent the number of cases the second house needs.
* The first house needs half the amount of the second house, so it needs x/2 cases.
* The third house needs double the amount of the first house, meaning it needs x cases.

Now we can set up an equation:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms: 2.5x = 250

Solving for x: x = 250 / 2.5 = 100

Therefore, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Let's break down the scoring system to understand the potential difference in Ava and Emma's scores.

* **Enemies:** Ava has an advantage here, earning 10 points per enemy and jumping on 8 more than Emma. This means Ava gains 80 more points (8 enemies * 10 points/enemy) than Emma from enemy jumps.

* **Berries:** Ava also has an edge with berries, earning 5 points each and collecting 3 more than Emma. This gives Ava a 15-point advantage (3 berries * 5 points/berry).

* **Timer:** This is where Emma has the advantage. Every second remaining on the timer is worth 30 points, and Emma has 4 more seconds than Ava. This means Emma earns 120 more points (4 seconds * 30 points/second) than Ava.

To determine the overall difference, we need to consider the net effect of these advantages and disadvantages.  

Since we don't know the base number of enemies jumped or berries collected, or the initial time on the timer, we can't calculate a precise numerical difference. 

**However, we can say that the difference in their scores will depend on the interplay of these factors.** If Emma's advantage in timer points is greater than Ava's combined advantage from enemies and berries, Emma will win. Conversely, if Ava's advantage in enemies and berries outweighs Emma's timer advantage, Ava will win.

"Let's break down this problem.  

We know Bob initially has 3 orange and 4 white fish. He buys 17 more fish, and afterwards, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob buys. This means he buys (17 - w) orange fish.

After the purchase, he has:

* Orange fish: 3 + (17 - w)
* White fish: 4 + w

We're told the number of orange fish is double the number of white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - w = 8 + 2w

Combining like terms:

12 = 3w

Solving for 'w':

w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

* **Weaker friends:** His friends who are less skilled get half that time, meaning 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter.
* **Stronger friend:** His better friend gets 1.5 times Jack's playtime, so 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Since they play for 4 hours, which is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes, we can calculate how many quarters each person needs:

* **Jack:** 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* **Weaker friends:** 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
* **Stronger friend:** 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Adding up all the quarters, they use a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar.  She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's represent the amount of zest as 'z'. This means the fragrance is also 'z'. The salt and sugar are each twice the amount of zest, so they are both '2z'. The oil is twice the amount of salt, making it '4z'.

The total amount of each ingredient must equal 10 ounces: z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10

Since the oil is 4z, Tanya uses 4 * 1 = 4 ounces of oil.

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

"Let's break down this age problem:

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100. We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be ""P""
    * Let Paul's age be ""Pa""
    * Let John's age be ""J""

* **Set up equations:**
    * P + Pa + J = 100 
    * Pa = J + 10
    * P = Pa + J

* **Solve for P:**

    1. Substitute the second equation (Pa = J + 10) into the third equation:
       P = (J + 10) + J
       P = 2J + 10

    2. Substitute the values of Pa and P into the first equation:
       (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

    3. Simplify and solve for J:
       4J + 20 = 100
       4J = 80
       J = 20

    4. Substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:
       P = 2(20) + 10
       P = 40 + 10
       P = 50



Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

The power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to consider each period separately.

* **Phase 1:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for 5 hours, totaling a 45% loss (9% * 5 = 45%).

* **Phase 2:**  The loss rate changes to 7% per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a 21% loss (7% * 3 = 21%).

* **Total Loss:** The combined loss over both phases is 66% (45% + 21%).

* **Charge Remaining After Losses:** This means 34% of the original charge remains (100% - 66% = 34%).

* **Charge Used by Friends:** The problem states that 28% of the original charge remains at the end. The difference between the charge remaining after losses (34%) and the final charge (28%) represents the charge used by friends, which is 6% (34% - 28% = 6%).

* **Original Charge:** Since the 6% used by friends was part of the 34% remaining after the initial losses, we can set up a proportion to find the original charge: 6% / 34% = x / 100%. Solving for x, we get x = 17.65% (approximately).

"Let's break down this problem.  

We know Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, and small stuffed animals cost $4 each. This means large ones cost $12 each.

Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and her earnings from small stuffed animals would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

We know her total earnings were $120, so we can set up the equation: 12x + 8x = $120

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

* A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines twice the amount of a dwarf with bare hands, meaning 12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day.
* A steel pickaxe increases output by 50% compared to an iron pickaxe, so a dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 24 pounds/day * 1.50 = 36 pounds/day.
* One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds/day * 30 days/month = 1080 pounds/month.
* Forty dwarves with steel pickaxes would mine a total of 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds/month.

"Let's analyze the probabilities:

* There's a 50% chance of a substitute teacher, meaning a 50% chance Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
* If the regular teacher is present, there's a 40% chance of a class-wide extension, again negating the need to turn in the homework.
* Even without a class extension, Marcus has a 20% chance of getting a personal extension.

This means the only scenario where Marcus *must* turn in his homework is if the regular teacher is present, there's no class extension, and he can't convince the teacher his dog ate it.

The probability of this happening is: (1 - 50%) * (1 - 40%) = 30%

* **Solving for Sarah's eggs:** Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Sarah painted 9 eggs.

* **Camden's eggs:** Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

* **Arnold and Madeline's eggs:** Together, Arnold and Madeline painted the remaining eggs: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

* **Arnold's eggs:** Assuming Arnold and Madeline painted the same number, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

We're given:

*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
*  The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

We can use a system of equations to solve for the length of the red rope.

Let:

*  *r* = length of the red rope
*  *b* = length of the blue rope
*  *y* = length of the yellow rope

From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. *r = 4b* 
2. *b = y - 7*
3. *r + b + y = 37*

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate *b*:

*r = 4(y - 7)*

Simplifying:

*r = 4y - 28*

Next, substitute both the expression for *r* and the second equation into the third equation:

*(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37*

Combining like terms:

*6y - 35 = 37*

Adding 35 to both sides:

*6y = 72*

Dividing both sides by 6:

*y = 12*

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (*y* = 12), we can substitute it back into the equation *b = y - 7* to find the length of the blue rope:

*b = 12 - 7*
*b = 5*

Finally, substitute the value of *b* into the equation *r = 4b* to find the length of the red rope:

*r = 4 * 5*
*r = 20*

* This brings Team A's total to 4 + 2 = 6 goals for the match.
* Team B's total is 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

2. In 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for our two unknowns.  

Let's solve the first equation for ""w"":
w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of ""w"" into the second equation:
c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
3c + 75 = 5c + 35

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the jar's volume:

* Igor brought 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
*  He brought the correct number of beakers, 7.
* In total, Igor placed 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items on the bench.

This contradicts the problem statement that Igor placed only 29 items on the bench. There must be an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for Igor to have lost beakers if he placed more items on the bench than intended.

"Let's break down the problem:

* James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so each table requires 2 screws/leg * 4 legs/table = 8 screws.
* With 4 tables, he'll need a total of 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws.
* Since he has 40 screws and needs 32, he'll have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws leftover.

"Here's how to determine the selling price per watermelon:

The vendor's profit is 25% of the original cost, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20.

This means the vendor sold all the watermelons for $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's analyze the situation. Ana peels oranges at a rate of 1 orange every 3 minutes, while Jane takes 4 minutes per orange.  Over an hour (60 minutes), Ana can peel 20 oranges (60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges). Jane, on the other hand, can peel 15 oranges in the same time frame (60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges).

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.

"Let's set up a system of equations to solve this problem. 

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' using substitution. From the first equation, we know w = 20 - c.  Substituting this into the second equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5


Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
