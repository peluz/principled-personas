"Hey there!  

So, Josh flipped a house, huh? Let's see how he did.  

He bought it for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. That's a total of $130,000 invested.

The repairs increased the value by 150%, which means the house is now worth $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000 more than he bought it for.

Adding that to the original price, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

That means he made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Not bad for a flip!

"Hey there!  

Let's see... James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. So that's 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters per workout.

Then, since he does this 3 times a week, he runs a total of 180 meters/workout * 3 workouts/week = 540 meters a week.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs a total of 60 cups.

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Since every other glass is discounted, Kylar is basically buying glasses in pairs. Each pair costs $5 + ($5 * 0.60) = $8.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.

Adding them all up, they have a total of 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, so to download 80 GB (40% of the file) it takes her 40 minutes.  Then she loses 20 minutes to the update.  She has 120 GB left to download, which will take another 60 minutes.

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. John drove 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph).  Then he spent 2 hours stuck, so he's still 180 miles from home. He covers another 15 miles at 30 mph, leaving him 165 miles from home (180 - 15 = 165). Finally, he drives 120 miles at 80 mph (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

That means he's 45 miles from home (165 - 120 = 45).

"Hey there!  

Let's break down Eliza's earnings. She gets $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.  

For the extra 5 hours, she gets paid 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 an hour. So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding it all up, Eliza earned $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

* Month 2 had three times the downloads of month 1: 60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads
* Month 3 saw a 30% drop from month 2: 180 downloads * 0.30 = 54 downloads less
* That means month 3 had: 180 downloads - 54 downloads = 126 downloads
* Adding up all three months: 60 downloads + 180 downloads + 126 downloads = 366 downloads

"Hey there! It'll take Carlos 12 years to start making money from his lemon tree.  

Here's how I figured it out:

* He makes $10.50 each year from selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each).
* It costs him $3.00 each year to take care of the tree.
* That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).
* Since the tree costs $90, it will take him 12 years to earn that back ($90 / $7.50 = 12).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, she must have started with more.  

Think of it like this:

* She sold some at the green house, then a couple more at the red house.
* That means the 5 she has left are what's left *after* selling to the orange house.

Since she sold half her remaining vacuums at the orange house, she must have had double that amount before.

So, 5 x 2 = 10.

But remember, that 10 is what she had *before* the orange house.

To get the starting amount, we need to add back what she sold at the red house (2) and what she sold at the green house (which was a third of the total).

Let's say she started with 'x' vacuum cleaners.

* Green house: x / 3
* Red house: 2
* Orange house: (x - x/3 - 2) / 2

We know this all adds up to 10:

(x / 3) + 2 + (x - x/3 - 2) / 2 = 10

Solving for x gives us 18.

"Hey there! To figure out Marissa's needed speed, we gotta do a little math.

She's already hiked 6 miles in 2 hours, leaving her with 6 miles to go.  To average 4 miles per hour for the whole hike, she needs to finish the 12 miles in 3 hours total. That means she only has 1 hour left for the remaining 6 miles.

So, she needs to hike at 6 miles per hour for the rest of the trail.

"Hey there!  

If the book is 25% off, that means Kyle paid 75% of the original price. To find the original price, we can set up a simple equation:

0.75 * original price = $19.50

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

Marie spent $33 on the chicken, milk, and apples. That means the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.

* 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each is 3 * $42 = $126.00

"
"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

The more expensive heels cost twice as much as the cheaper pair, so they're $33 * 2 = $66.

Together, both pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

"Hey there!

Let's break this down.  If Darrell and Allen's ages are in a 7:11 ratio, and their combined age is 162, we can figure out their individual ages.

Think of the ratio like parts of a whole.  

*  Their ages together represent 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
* Each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

So, Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses (80 + 60 + 100 = 240) and divide by the number of guesses (240 / 3 = 80).

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She'd have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has 110 coins total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Let's break this down. If Dana skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours). That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll make $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00).

So Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 after 40 years, and she starts getting an extra 5% of that each year after 20 years. Since she's leaving after 30 years, she'll get the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).

That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

Adding that to her base pension, her total annual pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Finally, divide the total by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

Let's figure this out. The puppy needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups. Then it needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is another 370 cups (2 cups/day * 185 days).

That's a total of 550 cups for the whole year. Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will need 5 bags (550 cups / 110 cups/bag).

"Hey there!

Let's break this down. If Sarah washes 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half that amount, he washes 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so he washes 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.

That means Raymond washes 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.

"Hey there!  Buying in bulk is usually cheaper, so let's see.  

If he buys the 3-packs, that's 18 flowers / 3 flowers per pack = 6 packs. That'll cost him 6 packs * $2.50 per pack = $15.00

But if he gets the 2-packs, he'll need 18 flowers / 2 flowers per pack = 9 packs. That's only 9 packs * $1.00 per pack = $9.00

He'd save $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00 by going with the 2-packs.

"Hey there! Amit here. Let's break down this salary situation.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  Four years ago, Adrien was making $40,000, so that means Lylah was making $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Now, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.40) = $43,076.92 (approximately).

Adding their salaries together, we get $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

Let's break this bee problem down.  If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* For every 1 queen bee, there are 2 baby bees.
* For every 1 queen bee, there are 4 worker bees (2 baby bees * 2 worker bees per baby).

So, if we think of the hive as groups of 7 bees (1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers), we can figure out how many groups there are by dividing the total number of bees by 7: 700 bees / 7 bees per group = 100 groups.

Since each group has 4 worker bees, there are 100 groups * 4 worker bees per group = 400 worker bees.

* She inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each).
* She inflated 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each).
* And 1 tire from the unicycle.

That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Working backward, we know 5 fries were left after the ants took one. Before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries before that, meaning those 6 fries represent one-third of the amount before the raccoon. So, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.

The pigeons ate 9 fries, leaving 18 fries. Before the pigeons, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate 2 * 7 = 14 fries.

That means there were 27 + 14 = 41 fries in the pack originally.

"Hey there! Amit here.  Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the total length of each type of bread in feet.

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches. That's 1200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet.
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches. That's 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet.
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet.

Now, let's add up the lengths: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, so that's 34 * 80 yards = 2720 yards.  In total, Kelly runs 100 yards + 2720 yards = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 yards - 1500 yards = 1320 yards farther than Blake.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. The price goes up by 20% every two months, so over 36 months, that's 18 price increases. Each increase is $4 ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

So, after 18 increases, the price will have gone up by $72 (18 x $4 = $72).

Adding that to the original price, a bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this problem down. If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age.  In two years, they'll both be older, so we need to add 2 to each of their current ages.  

The problem tells us that in two years, their ages added together will equal 28.  

Let's use some algebra to solve for Seth's age:

* Let Brooke's current age be ""b""
* Seth's current age is ""2b""

In two years:

* Brooke will be ""b + 2"" years old
* Seth will be ""2b + 2"" years old

Their ages in two years added together equal 28:

(b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

b = 8

So Brooke is currently 8 years old.

Seth is twice Brooke's age, so Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Hey there! It's Amit.  

Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a die bigger than 3, so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%. To get two even numbers in a row, you need an even number on the first roll (3 out of 6 chance) AND another even number on the second roll (also 3 out of 6). That means a 3 out of 6 chance times a 3 out of 6 chance, which is 9 out of 36, or 25%.

The difference between those is 50% - 25% = 25%.

We also know that red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, and he collects 42 eggs total. So:

* 3r + 5w = 42

Let's substitute 'r + 2' for 'w' in the second equation:

* 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

"Hey there!  

So, James has 32 water type cards after losing some. He also has 34 grass type cards now. That's a total of 96 cards (30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type, we divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100: (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%.

Rounding that to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

To figure this out, we need to know how many tomatoes they eat in total each week. Steve eats 6 a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, so she eats 3 a day. Together, that's 9 tomatoes a day. Over a week, that's 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, they'll need 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Let's see... Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That means he's writing and receiving 6 letters a week.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 6 letters * 5 pages/letter = 30 pages he writes and receives each week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes writing each week.

That's 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours of writing.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Griffin started with 24 fries, and Kyle and Billy took a bunch. Then Colby took some too.  Since Griffin ended up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him some to make up for all those fries that were taken away.

Let's see... Kyle took 5, and Billy took twice that, so he took 10. That's 15 fries gone already. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so that's 2 more fries gone.

So, before Colby took any, Griffin had 9 fries left (24 - 15 = 9).  

That means Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries to get him back up to 27 (27 - 9 = 18).

"Hey there!  

Let's figure out how much Jean paid her makeup artist.  

It costs $250 per hour for makeup, and it takes 6 hours each day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

Since she needs it done 4 days a week, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.

Over the 5 weeks of filming, that's $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means Jean saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

So, the final cost is $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

On Tuesday, Sue had 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, which is 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister ate 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, and her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

That means Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Adding up all the fruit, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together, they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9, and Ruby will be 6s + 9. We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Simplifying that equation:

6s + 9 = 3s + 27

3s = 18

s = 6


So Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 this year, for a total of 135 books sold. Since she started with 250 books and has 50 left, that means she sold 200 books (250 - 50 = 200).  

That means she sold 65 books in the second year (200 - 135 = 65).

At $20 per book, her earnings for the second year were $1300 (65 * 20 = 1300).

"Hey there!  

Let's break down Watson's earnings. He works 50 hours a week (10 hours/day * 5 days/week) at $10 an hour, so that's $500 right there. Plus, he gets a sweet $300 bonus every week for the company doing well. That brings his total weekly earnings to $800.

Let's break this down.  Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, meaning Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

We know Chile's population back then was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since that was half the current population, Chile's population now is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2d players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is d/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up an equation: d + 2d + d/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get 3.5d = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives us d = 30.

But, 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and another 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans.  That means 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't make it.

So, 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up to Martha's party.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out which job pays Nick more after taxes.

Job A is pretty straightforward: $15 an hour for 2000 hours is $30,000.  With a 20% tax rate, he'd take home $24,000.

Job B is a bit trickier.  He makes a flat $42,000, but has to pay $6,000 in property tax first. That leaves him with $36,000. Then, a 10% tax on that means he pays another $3,600, for a total take-home of $32,400.

Looks like Job B nets Nick an extra $8,400.

After the first year, the stock jumps up 50%, meaning each share is now worth $8 + ($8 * 0.50) = $12. Her shares are now worth $96 (8 shares * $12/share).

But then the stock takes a hit in the second year, dropping 25%. That means each share is now worth $12 - ($12 * 0.25) = $9.

If two groups are the same size, and the third is 10 smaller, we can think of it like this:

*  Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 200 students, so: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Let's solve for x:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

So, the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

Okay, so if we think of it like this:

* If there were only cows, there'd be 60 / 3 = 20 cows.
* Since there are twice as many chickens, there are 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those up, we get a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

Since it does three round trips a day, that's 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles a day.

Chloe only hiked for 5 hours at 9 kilometers per hour, meaning she hiked 45 kilometers (9 x 5 = 45). That means Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe (112 - 45 = 67).

"Hey there!  Let's figure out Millie's profit.

She makes 36 cups of lemonade (3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher).

Selling all of it brings in $36 (36 cups * $1/cup).

After paying for supplies, her profit is $18 ($36 - $18).

Since she sells 4 cups per hour, she'll sell all the lemonade in 9 hours (36 cups / 4 cups/hour).

That means she makes a profit of $2 per hour ($18 / 9 hours).

"Hey there!  

If Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, that means the 12.8 hectares represent 2/5 of his original land.  To find the total land he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/5) * Original Land = 12.8 hectares

To solve for the Original Land, we can divide both sides by (2/5):

Original Land = 12.8 hectares / (2/5) = 32 hectares

Let's break this down. If the popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  Since they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many are in each ""part"" of the ratio.

165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. We know each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one.  If we have a total of 304 humps, we can think about how many of those humps *must* belong to camels.

Since there are 180 heads total, let's say we had only camels. That would be 180 heads * 2 humps/head = 360 humps.  That's way too many!

This means some of those heads must be dromedaries.  Since each dromedary has one hump, the difference between our camel-only hump count and the actual hump count tells us how many humps belong to dromedaries: 360 - 304 = 56 humps.

And since each dromedary has one hump, there must be **56** dromedaries.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  You can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  

Since you can't have half a card, Kenny must have started with 50 cards.

"Hey there!  Let's break down this triathlon problem.

James is a bit faster in the swim than Jon, but slower on the bike. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James must have made up some time on the run.  

Here's how we can figure out James's run time:

* **Jon's total time:** 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
* **James's swim time:** 40 minutes * 0.90 (10% faster) = 36 minutes
* **James's bike time:** 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes
* **James's total time:** 36 minutes + 85 minutes + James's run time = 121 minutes + James's run time

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes longer than Jon's:

* 121 minutes + James's run time = 170 minutes - 10 minutes
* 121 minutes + James's run time = 160 minutes

Subtract 121 minutes from both sides to find James's run time:

* James's run time = 39 minutes

"Hey there! To figure out when the costs are the same, we need to think about how the price changes with each guest. 

Venue 1 has a base cost of $200, and then adds $5 per person. Venue 2 is $25 per person, but includes food.  

Let's say 'x' is the number of guests.  We want to find 'x' where the total cost is the same for both places.

So, for Venue 1, the cost would be $200 + $5x. For Venue 2, it's $25x.

We need to find the 'x' that makes these two amounts equal:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

* She writes the alphabet twice, so that's 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.
* Then she writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
* So far, she's written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.
* Finally, she writes everything again, adding another 65 letters.

That means Elise wrote a total of 65 + 65 = 130 letters.

"Let's break this down. James has 80 toys, and Jonathan wants a set five times bigger, so that's 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach that goal, he currently has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend.

* Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
* Two pens will cost him 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
* The calculator is $12.00
* The geometry set is $10.00

That's a total of $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00 before the discount.

With a 10% discount, he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

So, Daniel will pay $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Let's break this down. If Ray swims a mile in cold water in 16 minutes, in warm water it takes him 34 minutes (twice that time plus 2 minutes).

So, 3 miles in cold water would take him 48 minutes (16 minutes/mile * 3 miles). In warm water, it would take him 102 minutes (34 minutes/mile * 3 miles).

That means he takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles in warm water (102 minutes - 48 minutes).

"Hey there!  

So Maggie's oven is running hot.  If it's off by a consistent percentage, we can figure out the setting she needs.  

First, we need to see what percentage hotter it's running. It's 18 degrees hotter than 450, so that's (18 / 450) * 100% = 4% hotter.

To get 520 degrees, she should set it 4% lower. That means subtracting 4% of 520, which is 520 * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees.

So, Maggie should set her oven to 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  That's 40 + 44 = 84 utensils for her friend.

Together, they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

"Hey there!  

So, Pete gets 90 contacts per box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each pair costs him $100 / 90 = $1.11 (rounded up) per pair. Since the contacts are 10% off, each box costs $90.  

If he buys two boxes, that's $90 x 2 = $180.00 total.

With 180 pairs of contacts, that means each pair costs $180 / 180 = $1.00.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she'll need 800 ml of water (1600 / 2 = 800).

"Hey there! This is a classic jelly bean puzzle.  

Here's how to crack it:

Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans.

* Red jelly beans: 0.99b (1% less than blue)
* Green jelly beans: 1.01b (1% more than blue)

All together, that's b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500 jelly beans.

Combining like terms, we get 3b = 4500.

So, b = 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 1485 red jelly beans and 1515 green jelly beans.

The difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

So, x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure out how much John's physical therapy cost. He went twice a week for 6 weeks, and each session was 2 hours long. That means he had 2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions total.

Since each session was 2 hours, he had a total of 12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours of physical therapy.

At $125 per hour, his total cost was 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000.

"Hey there!  

To figure out Ashley's internet speed in Mb per hour, we need to do a little conversion.

First, there are 1000 kilobits (kb) in 1 megabit (Mb). So, her speed of 20 kb/second is equal to 0.02 Mb/second (20 / 1000 = 0.02).

Next, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 * 60 = 3600).

Finally, to get her speed in Mb per hour, we multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

Let's figure this out. If Manny's parents only want to spend $10 per class, and the total cost is $60 for 10 classes, that means they can afford $100 total ($10/class * 10 classes = $100).

Since the classes already cost $60, they have $40 left over ($100 - $60 = $40). That means Manny can miss 4 classes before it goes over budget ($40 / $10 per class = 4 classes).

* The plane itself costs $150,000.
* He's paying $5,000 a month for the hangar, and double that for fuel, which is $10,000.
* That's a total of $15,000 per month to keep that plane flying.
* Over a year, that's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Add that to the initial cost of the plane, and James is looking at a total of $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000 for the first year.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If the rice took 30 minutes, and the pork took 20 minutes longer, that means the pork took 50 minutes.  

The beans took half the time it took to cook the rice and pork together, so that's 30 + 50 = 80 minutes total, and then half of that is 40 minutes for the beans.

Adding it all up: 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out.  If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We know there are 70 legs total, and 20 heads.

Since each animal has one head, we have 20 animals in total.

Let's say there are 's' sheep. That means there are (20-s) geese.

Now we can set up an equation: 4s + 2(20-s) = 70

Solving for 's', we get: 4s + 40 - 2s = 70

Simplifying: 2s = 30

Therefore, s = 15

There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

If one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, and their total age is 44, we can figure out the twin's age.

Let's think of it like this:

*  The triplets are all the same age, so let's call that age ""r"".
* One twin is ""r + 7"" years old.
* The other twin is also ""r + 7"" years old.

So, the total age is: r + r + r + (r + 7) + (r + 7) = 44

That simplifies to 5r + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5r = 30

Divide both sides by 5: r = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before we add that in, the bill is $40.

60% of $40 is $40 * 0.60 = $24 for the heartworm check.

Adding that to the vaccine cost, the total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

John brought $125, so he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how many more points class 3B needs.

* Betty did great, getting 30% more points than Adam's 50, which is 15 extra points. That means Betty has 65 points.
* Tom has 30 less points than Betty, so he has 35 points.
* Marta collected triple Tom's points, giving her 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points for the trip, so they're still short 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Greta saves half her paycheck for retirement, so that's $2400 / 2 = $1200.

Then she spends 20% on her car, which is (20/100) * $2400 = $480.

That means she's spent a total of $1200 + $480 = $1680.

Subtracting that from her paycheck, she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left.

* That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in a series.
* Of those, 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies are older and cost $5 each, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.
* The rest, 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies, are newer and cost the full $10, so that's 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67



$3866.67

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Winston spent.

* Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00/pound = $12.00
* Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00/pound = $8.00

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. They drove for 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour, so they covered 4.5 * 50 = 225 miles. Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour, adding another 1.5 * 20 = 30 miles.

That means their vacation spot is a total of 225 + 30 = 255 miles away.

"Hey!  If two pizzas cost $30, and they bought four pizzas for $64 total, the other two pizzas must have cost the rest. That's $64 - $30 = $34.

Then 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

That's 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea!

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So, Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.
* His better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

That's a total of 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

At $0.25 per quarter, that's 68 * $0.25 = $17.00.

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

So, Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Milly will lose.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. It's $0.35 per pound and the book weighs 4 pounds, so that's $0.35 * 4 = $1.40. Then, there's an extra $0.08 per mile, and it's a 20-mile trip, so that's $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.  

Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Now, Amazon will only give Milly back 75% of the $32 she paid, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

That's a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars for the first three weeks.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y, for a total of 100 goats. He sells 10 from Farm X and 20 from Farm Y, which is a total of 30 goats sold.  

That means he has 100 goats - 30 goats = 70 goats left.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month and spends $2640 a year, we need to see how much each pair costs.

He buys 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs of shoes a year.

So, $2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... 3 baskets of green food will cost 3 * $25 = $75.  

You get $2 off each basket of red food, so 3 baskets of red food will cost (3 * $18) - $6 = $54 - $6 = $48.

In total, that's $75 + $48 = $123.

"Hey there!  

It would take 15 hours to clean half the rooms. 

Here's how I figured that out:

*  You've got 90 rooms, and half of that is 45 rooms.
* Each room takes 20 minutes to clean, so 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes total.
* There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. They build 12 homes the first year, then 12 * 3 = 36 homes the second year. That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 homes. In the third year, they double that, so they build 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Adding it all up, they build 48 + 96 = 144 homes over the three years.

"Hey there!  

Let me see... I'm good with numbers. So, you're trying to figure out your age.  

Let's call your age ""x"". Your brother is ""x + 3"", your sister is ""x - 2"", and your mom is ""3(x + 3) - 1"".

Adding everyone up, we get: x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Simplifying that gives us: 7x + 11 = 87

Subtract 11 from both sides: 7x = 76

Divide both sides by 7: x = 10.86

Since you can't be part of a year old, you must be about 11 years old.

If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know:

* Anne has F - 12 books.
* Sofie has F + 13 books.

All together, they have 85 books, so:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Dividing both sides by 3: F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries ($160 / 4 = $40).

*  Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 per pack.
*  The apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.
*  The strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 * (2/3) = 50).

The Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, or 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day. That's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets in a month.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 would bring in 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 32400 * $6 = $194400.

The difference? $259200 - $194400 = $64800.

Fern would make $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Cameron stays for 17 hours. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos, and the extra 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. So his total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

A 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos. That means he saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much hay Nate needs.

Each sheep needs 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds of hay.

That means he needs 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds for the goats.

And for the sheep, he'll need 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

In total, Nate needs 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.

After spending $50 on gas, he has 300 - 50 = $250 left.

Those pencils cost him 5 * $10 = $50, leaving him with 250 - 50 = $200.

He wants to save $100, so he'll have 200 - 100 = $100 for pens.

He can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jen will earn.

* Her yams will bring in 6 * $1.50 = $9.00
* Her sweet potatoes will earn her 10 * $2.00 = $20.00

"Hey there! This is a classic distance, rate, and time problem. Let's break it down:

* **First leg:** James swims 12 miles at 2 mph, so that takes him 6 hours (12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours).
* **Rest time:** He rests for half the swimming time, which is 3 hours (6 hours / 2 = 3 hours).
* **Second leg:** He has 8 miles left to swim (20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles) and swims at half his original speed, which is 1 mph (2 mph / 2 = 1 mph). This leg takes him 8 hours (8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours).

* **Total time:** Adding up all the parts, the total time is 17 hours (6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours).

* **New York Times:** He earns 10% of $5 per copy, which is $0.50. For 6 copies, that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.
* **Wall Street Journal:** He earns 8% of $15 per copy, which is $1.20. For 10 copies, that's $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, who is 26. That means Marcus is 21 years old. Since Marcus is half Leo's age, Leo must be twice Marcus's age.

So, Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If Bahati scored the most and had 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra.

Let Azibo's points be ""x"".

* Bahati: x + 20
* Dinar: x + 10

Together they scored 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3: x = 5

So Azibo scored 5 points.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of day four as it did at the end of day one, so there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of day one. That doesn't make sense, so the map must be a bit off.  

They dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out.  If Stan has 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, and together they caught 339, we can use some algebra to solve for Stan's catch.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.

* Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.
* Alex caught 4A - 13 + 5 Pokemon (5 more than Stan).

Adding all three together: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 13 + 5) = 339

Simplifying: 9A - 21 = 339

Solving for A: 9A = 360, so A = 40

Now, plugging A back into the equation for Stan: Stan caught 4(40) - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

"Hey there!  Let's count those sticks. They have 9 red ones, and 5 more blue ones than that, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, meaning there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  

Adding them all up, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

* There are 3000 students total, and half are over 16, so that's 1500 students.
* A quarter of those older students are guys, meaning 1500 / 4 = 375 are male and over 16.
* That leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.
* The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16.
* Half of them are guys, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.
* That means there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Adding those together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at the school.

"Hey there! Amit here. Let's figure this out.

Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped 4500 gallons * (3/4) = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

Over both days, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

That means there are 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons left to fill.

"Hey there! This sounds like a classic battery drain problem.  

Let's break it down:

* The power bank lost 45% in the first 5 hours (9% per hour * 5 hours).
* Then it lost another 21% in the next 3 hours (7% per hour * 3 hours).
* That's a total loss of 66% (45% + 21%).

So, before all that draining, the power bank had 34% left (100% - 66%).

But we know it ended up at 28%. That means Maria's friends used 6% of the power bank's charge (34% - 28% = 6%).

Since that 6% came from the 34% that was left, we can figure out what 100% was originally.

6% represents about 17.65% of the original charge.


**Answer:** 17.65%

"Hey there!  

So, the price of carrots goes up by 5% each year. That means after one year, they'd cost $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126.

After another year, the price goes up by 5% of the new price: $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30.

And finally, after three years: $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92.

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones cost $4, then large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Sally starts with 25 red + 7 green + 12 yellow = 44 balloons.

Then she loses 40% of the red ones, which is 25 * 0.40 = 10 balloons.

That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

She also loses half her yellow balloons, which is 12 / 2 = 6 balloons.

So now she has 15 red + 6 yellow + 7 green = 28 balloons.

Finally, she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 balloons.

Adding those to her collection, she has 28 + 6 = 34 balloons.

"Hey there!  To figure out how much fabric Jim needs, we gotta think about the size of the bed plus the extra he wants.

The bed is 6 feet by 8 feet, so we add 2 feet to each side for length and width:

* Width: 8 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 12 feet

Jim needs 120 square feet of fabric.

Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.

* Second person: x + $80
* Third person: 2 * (x + $80) = 2x + $160

Adding it all up: x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining like terms: 4x + $240 = $1920

Dividing both sides by 4: x = $420

So the first person got $420.

* She needs 200 toothpicks total.
* She already has 120 toothpicks (10 per week for 12 weeks).
* That means she needs 80 more toothpicks (200 - 120 = 80).
* Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 8 more weeks to get the rest (80 / 10 = 8).

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800. That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If they have 100 feet total and Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, we can set up a little equation. Let's say Sam gets ""x"" feet of fence. Harry gets ""x + 60"" feet.  

Together, that's x + (x + 60) = 100 feet.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hey there! Amit here, your friendly neighborhood bike shop owner. Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

* He sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.
* He sold 45 BMX bikes at half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250 each. That brings in 45 * $250 = $11,250.
* The rest were MTBs, so he sold 105 of those at $500 each, totaling 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding it all up, Marcel made $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 in sales that month.

He spends another 100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday learning, for a total of 100 * 2 = 200 minutes.

Adding it all up, John spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week. That's 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

"Hey there!  

To figure out the cost, we need to find the total area of the walls and then see how many gallons of paint we'll need.

* The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 * 8 = 80 square feet each.
* Together, those two walls are 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.
* The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, making them 5 * 8 = 40 square feet each.
* Those two walls add up to 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

* In total, all four walls are 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

* Since each gallon covers 20 square feet, we'll need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

* At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

"Hey there! Amit here.  

To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to think about how much she'll need for retirement and how much she's saving each year.

She wants to live on $40,000 a year for 20 years in retirement, so that's a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000.

Since she saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, she's putting away $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 each year.

To reach her goal, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

To figure this out, we need to think about how the temperatures mix.  Since Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees, the second mug must be pretty warm to make up for the cooler water.

Let's say the second mug is 'x' degrees.  

We know:

* 4 ounces of 33-degree water adds 132 ""degree-ounces"" (33 * 4 = 132)
* 1 ounce of the second mug adds 'x' ""degree-ounces""

That means the total ""degree-ounces"" in the mix is 132 + x.

Since it's mixed into 5 ounces total (4 + 1), the average temperature is (132 + x) / 5.

This average needs to be at least 40 degrees, so:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

Solving for x, we get:

132 + x >= 200
x >= 68

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

Over 3 days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned a total of $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

Let's see... Mason eats 4 carrots a day during the week, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 carrots. On the weekend, he eats 5 carrots each day, for a total of 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.  

Adding those together, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots in a week.

"Hey there! Amit here. Let's figure this out.

So, Hortex needs to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people. That's a lot of juice!

First, we need to see how much energy their current production covers. They make 4200 bottles, and each bottle provides 20% of a person's daily energy needs. That means they're currently covering 4200 bottles * 20% = 84000% of a person's daily energy needs.

Now, 2300 people need 2300 * 100% = 230000% of daily energy in total.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230000% - 84000% = 146000%.

Finally, since each bottle covers 20%, they need to produce 146000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

* The third complex is 60% bigger than that, meaning it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.
* So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.
* That means he collects from a total of 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* Since he collects from each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
* At $0.40 per collection, he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week.

"Hey there! Amit here.  

So, you want to know how many avocados a tree can produce in 10 years?  Here's how I see it:

* Years 1-5:  Avocado trees are still young, so they don't produce much. Let's say a 5-year-old tree gives us about 50 avocados.
* Years 6-7: Things start picking up! A 6-year-old might give us three times that, or 150 avocados. A 7-year-old could produce even more, maybe around 350.
* Years 8-9: By year 8, the tree is really going strong. Maybe it produces a bit less than a 10-year-old tree, which we'll say gives us a whopping 1000 avocados. So, the 8-year-old might give us 800. Year 9 is a bit of a mystery, sometimes they take a break and don't produce much at all.
* Year 10: Back to a big harvest! 1000 avocados, just like we figured.

Adding it all up, that's 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 avocados over 10 years.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this problem down. We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters, we can figure out the red rope's length.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's call the blue rope's length ""b"".
* The yellow rope is ""b + 7"" long.
* The red rope is ""4b"" long.

Adding them all up, we get: b + (b + 7) + 4b = 37

Combining the 'b's, we have: 6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides: 6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6: b = 5

Since the red rope is 4 times the blue rope's length, the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.

Since he has four bedrooms, the total bedroom space is 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

"
"Hey there!  Let's break this problem down.

Let Wendy's age be ""w"" and Colin's age be ""c"".

We know:

*  w = 5(c + 7)  (Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years)
* c + 25 = (1/3)w (In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now)

From the first equation, we can say w = 5c + 35.

Substituting this into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying:

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

c = (40/3) * (3/2)

c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Hey there! Amit here. Let's break this jelly bean problem down.

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in that jar.  It's a pretty big jar, so we'll need to calculate the volume.

The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base, so that's 36 square inches.  And it's 15 inches tall, so the total volume is 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, right? They leave some air gaps.  So, we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means we can only really fit 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches worth of jelly beans.

Now, each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches. So, we can fit 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans in the jar.

If 30% of those are red, then there are 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

Looks like Tim was off by 36 jelly beans!

"Hey there!  

Luke needs enough fabric to cover twice the width of all his windows.  Since he has five windows that are each 35 inches wide, that's a total of 5 * 35 = 175 inches.  

To get twice that amount, he'll need 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Carly needs 10 treats total and each person gets 2, she's making treats for 5 people.  Since she makes 2 fewer brownies than three times the cupcakes, let's try some numbers. If she made 3 cupcakes, she'd make 7 brownies (3 * 3 - 2 = 7). That's a total of 10 treats!

So Carly made **3** cupcakes.

"Hey there!  

So Karen wants a manicure, a pedicure, and nail art on all ten fingers.  Let's see... the manicure and pedicure together would normally cost $75, but with the 20% discount for getting both, that brings it down to $60.  Adding the nail art at $3 per nail comes out to another $30.  

That means her total would be $90.

"Hey there!  

So the toy went up 80% in December, which means it increased by $32 (80% of $40). That brings the price to $72. Then, in January, it went down by 50%, which is a decrease of $36 (50% of $72).  

So the final price in January was $36.

"Hey there!  

Let's break down Charlie's earnings.  He makes $80 per hour normally, but gives a $20 discount to veterans, so he charges them $60.

* Standard lessons: 4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320
* Veteran lessons: 2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Adding those together, Charlie makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.

If the distance is 6000 km, and he's going for 72 hours (3 days * 24 hours/day), he'll cover 3600 km (50 km/hr * 72 hours).

That means he'll have covered 60% of the distance (3600 km / 6000 km * 100%).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes. That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes gone already.

Their mom used 48 grapes for pies (4 pies * 12 grapes per pie).

To find the starting amount, we add those together: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

She's selling 60 eggs (5 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen) in groups of three for $1.00 per group. That means she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sales.

Her total earnings will be 20 sales * $1.00/sale = $20.00.

Finally, her profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Mary made 116 ice cubes total, and the blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, we can set up an equation. Let 'x' be the number of strawberry cubes.

So, blueberry cubes would be 5x - 4.

Total cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6: x = 20

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Jason needs 15 customers to buy cars. Since he gets one customer for every 25 calls, that means he needs to make 15 customers * 25 calls/customer = 375 calls.

But wait, there's more! For every 2 customers who visit, only 1 buys a car. So, he actually needs to get 15 cars * 2 customers/car = 30 customers to visit the dealership.

That means he needs to make 30 customers * 25 calls/customer = 750 calls.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the flashlights, they have 36 + 4 = 40 candles and flashlights.

For the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Adding all those up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.

* The last 30 seconds it slows down to half the previous rate, so 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.
* And finally, a quarter of the last batch pops from the leftover heat, so 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Let's see... Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so that's 15 cars a week. He makes $4 per car, so he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120.

"Hey there! Let's count those cookies.

Randy starts with 18 cookies. After his snack, he has 16 left. Then he eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, leaving him with 14.  Giving away 2 sugar cookies brings his total down to 12. Finally, baking 12 more cookies (4 of each kind) brings his total up to 24 cookies.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Half of Matthew's toys is 12 / 2 = 6 toys.

He'd make 6 * $5 = $30 from the first half.

And 6 * $7 = $42 from the second half.

Adding those together, he'd earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. The dog digs a total of 84 holes (6 holes/day * 14 days).  Every day, Nate fills 3 fewer holes than the dog digs (9 filled - 6 dug = 3). So, it'll take him 28 days to fill all the holes (84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days). That's 4 weeks (28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks).

"Let's break this down. Igor was supposed to bring 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, for a total of 37 items. He only managed to put 29 items on the bench.  

He brought 8 test tubes (half of 16) and 16 Petri dishes (2 more than 14). That's 8 + 16 = 24 items.

That means he only brought 29 - 24 = 5 beakers to the bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If each table needs 8 screws (4 legs x 2 screws per leg) and he's building 4 tables, that's 32 screws total (8 screws/table x 4 tables).

Since he starts with 40 screws, he'll have 8 left over (40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws).

"Hey there! If one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, that means the second basket has 20 eggs.  

So, together they have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money the girls raised.

* Kim raised $750 because she earned $320 more than Alexandra's $430.
* Maryam raised $700, which is $400 more than Sarah's $300.

Adding up all their earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

"Hey there!  Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we know Aaron ran his part in 16 minutes. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, he covers twice the distance in the same amount of time. This means Vanessa ran twice the distance Aaron did in the same time. So, Vanessa took twice as long as Aaron, which is 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... 6 reservations a night, 2 meals per reservation at $5 each, plus a $5 bottle of wine. That's $15 per reservation.

So, they make $90 each night (6 reservations * $15).

Since they're open 2 days a week, they make $180 a week ( $90/night * 2 nights).

"Hey there!  

So, the vendor wants to make a 25% profit on his $80 investment. That means he wants to make an extra $20 (25% of $80).  

Adding the profit to his original cost, he needs to sell all the watermelons for $100.  Since he has 50 watermelons, each one needs to sell for $2.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9. James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the youngest son is 5. In three years, he'll be 8.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes. In an hour, there are 60 minutes.

* Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.
* Jane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. We know each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4.  If we have 20 animals total and 70 legs, we can use a little algebra to solve for the number of chickens.

Let me think... 5 chickens would have 10 legs (5 x 2 = 10), leaving 60 legs for the cows (70 - 10 = 60).  

Since each cow has 4 legs, there must be 15 cows (60 / 4 = 15).

Let's check: 5 chickens + 15 cows = 20 animals. That works!

So the answer is **5**.
