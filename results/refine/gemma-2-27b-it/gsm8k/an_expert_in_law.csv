"Let's analyze this situation logically.  We can work backward from the known information to determine the starting number of vacuum cleaners.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining after selling to the orange house. This means she had 5 + (the number she sold at the orange house) before that sale.

She sold half of her remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, so she had double that amount before selling to the orange house: 2 * (5 + (the number she sold at the orange house)).

We know she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house, so before that sale, she had: 2 * (5 + (the number she sold at the orange house)) + 2.

Finally, she sold one-third of her original number at the green house. This means two-thirds of her original number is represented by: 2 * (5 + (the number she sold at the orange house)) + 2.

To find the original number, we need to figure out the number she sold at the orange house. We can set up an equation and solve for it.

Let 'y' represent the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.

The equation is: (2/3)x = 2(5 + y) + 2

Solving for 'x' (the original number) will give us the answer.

Combining like terms:

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Given the information provided, we can deduce the number of worker bees through a series of logical deductions.  

We are told there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  This establishes a clear proportional relationship between the three types of bees.

Since the total number of bees is 700, we can work backwards from the queen bee population to determine the number of worker bees. 

Let's denote:

*  *q* = the number of queen bees
*  *b* = the number of baby bees
*  *w* = the number of worker bees

We know:

* *b = 2q*
* *w = 2b*
* *q + b + w = 700*

By substituting the first two equations into the third, we can solve for *q*, then *b*, and finally *w*.

The solution reveals that there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

From Fact 1, we know: s = 2b

From Fact 2, we know: (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplifying the equation: 3b + 4 = 28

"Let's analyze this situation. We can approach this as a system of equations.  

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens. We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** w = r + 2 (There are two more white chickens than red chickens)
* **Equation 2:** 3r + 5w = 42 (The total number of eggs collected daily is 42)

We can solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens) using substitution. Substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4

"As a legal professional, I can't provide financial advice. Determining whether a property fits within a budget involves more than just the listed price.  

It's crucial to consider all associated costs, including but not limited to:

* **Closing Costs:** These can vary significantly and often include fees for title insurance, appraisal, inspection, and legal services.
* **Property Taxes:** These are recurring annual expenses that can be substantial.
* **Homeowner's Insurance:** This is mandatory for most mortgage lenders and protects against damage to the property.

It's essential for Mrs. Cruz to consult with a qualified real estate agent and financial advisor to get a comprehensive understanding of all costs associated with purchasing the property and ensure it aligns with her budget.

"From a legal perspective, it's important to note that real estate transactions involve various costs beyond the sale price. In this case, Mr. Tan incurred transfer fees (3% of the selling price) and brokerage fees (5% of the selling price), in addition to repaying the outstanding loan amount.  

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to subtract all these expenses from the selling price:

* **Transfer Fees:** $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000
* **Brokerage Fees:** $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000
* **Total Fees:** $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
* **Total Expenses:** $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000

"Let's break down this problem like a legal case. We have the facts:

* **Fact 1:** The sweater's body requires 900 stitches.
* **Fact 2:** The collar needs 1/10th the stitches of the body, which is 90 stitches.
* **Fact 3:** The rosette takes twice the stitches of the collar, meaning 180 stitches.
* **Fact 4:** The entire sweater project totals 1800 stitches.

To determine the stitches per sleeve, we must first calculate the total stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the total sweater stitches and divide by 2 (for the two sleeves): (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"Let's analyze the time required for this landscaping project.  

Matthew needs 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of them, totaling 90 minutes (3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes). For the large holes, it's 10 minutes per hole times 15 holes, equaling 150 minutes (10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes).

Adding those times together, we get a total of 240 minutes (90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes).  Converting that to hours, we find it will take Matthew 4 hours to complete the job (240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours).

Simplifying and solving for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

* **Solve for the unknowns:** Substituting the second equation into the first, we get: c + 2c = 60. This simplifies to 3c = 60, and solving for 'c' gives us c = 20 cows.  Substituting this back into h = 2c, we find h = 40 chickens.

* **Calculate the total legs:** Cows have 4 legs each, so the cows contribute 20 * 4 = 80 legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, adding another 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

* **Final Calculation:** The total number of legs on the farm is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny possessed, we need to work backward from the known information. 

Kenny had $50 in spending money after purchasing the $100 amusement park ticket, indicating he earned $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sold each card for $1.50, he sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards. As he cannot sell fractions of cards, we round down to 33 cards.

This represents 2/3 of his total collection, as he kept 1/3.  Therefore, his initial collection consisted of 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards. Rounding to the nearest whole number, Kenny started with 50 cards.

* David found half the number Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects.
* Lily found 7 more insects than David, meaning Lily found (B/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects found by all three is 43.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get:

2B + 7 = 43

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2B = 36

Dividing both sides by 2:

B = 18

This means Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half the number Bodhi found, so David found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

"In a real estate transaction, determining the value of individual components can be complex.  However, if we assume a simplified scenario where the house and lot are the only components, and the house's price is indeed three times the lot's price, we can apply basic algebraic principles.

Given a total cost of $120,000, and the house costing three times the lot, we can represent the lot's cost as 'x'. The house would then cost 3x. The sum of these two values equals the total cost: x + 3x = $120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000. Dividing both sides by 4, we find the lot's cost (x) to be $30,000.  Multiplying this by 3, we determine the house's cost to be $90,000.

"In a legal context, we often deal with situations where precise measurements and angles are crucial, such as in property surveys or accident reconstructions.  

While I'm not a surveyor or engineer, I can apply basic geometric principles to this problem.

Let's break it down:

* We know the angles in any triangle must add up to 180 degrees.
* We're given that one angle is twice another, and another is three times the smallest.

Let's represent the smallest angle as 'x'. This means we have angles of 'x', '2x', and '3x'.

Adding these together, we get x + 2x + 3x = 180 degrees.

Combining like terms, we have 6x = 180 degrees.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find that x = 30 degrees.

The largest angle is 3x, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Based on the provided information, we can determine the lifespan of the tire in years. 

The tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles per month. This means the tire rotates 145,000 times each month (400 miles/month * 725 rotations/2 miles).

With a maximum rotation capacity of 10,440,000 rotations, the tire will last for 72 months (10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month).

Converting this to years, the tire should last for 6 years (72 months / 12 months/year).

"Let's analyze the shingle distribution for these three houses.  We know the total is 250 cases.  

The second house's shingle needs are represented by 'x'. The first house requires half that amount, or x/2. The third house needs double the first house, meaning it requires x cases.

The total shingle allocation is the sum of each house's needs: x/2 + x + x = 250.

Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Solving for x, we find that x = 100.

Therefore, the third house requires **100** cases of shingles.

"Let's analyze the cost breakdown for Mike's movie replacement project.

We'll treat each category of movies as a separate contractual agreement:

* **Series Movies:**  Mike is entering into a bulk purchase agreement for these. The price is stipulated as one-third the cost of a normal movie, which is $10. Therefore, each series movie costs $10/3 = $3.33 (rounded to the nearest cent). With 200 series movies, the total cost is 200 * $3.33 = $666.

* **Older Movies:** These are priced at a discounted rate of $5 per movie. With 160 older movies, the total cost is 160 * $5 = $800.

* **Newer Movies:** These are purchased at the standard rate of $10 per movie. With 240 newer movies, the total cost is 240 * $10 = $2400.

Summing the costs for each category, Mike's total expenditure for replacing his movie collection is $666 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.

"Naruto's ability to lift a mountain is directly proportional to the lifting capacities of Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei.  

We know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, meaning Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 x 4 = 48). Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, meaning Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 x 10 = 480).

Simple interest is calculated as Principal * Rate * Time.  

In this case:

* Principal = $300
* Rate = 3/4 or 0.75 (expressed as a decimal)
* Time = 3 years

Therefore, the total interest earned is $300 * 0.75 * 3 = $675.

Adding this to the original principal, Brenda will have a total of $300 + $675 = $975 after 3 years.

"This problem requires us to analyze the relationships between the ages of family members and use algebraic equations to determine the unknown age.  

Let's denote the individual's age as ""x"". We can then express the ages of the other family members in terms of ""x"":

* Brother's age: x + 3
* Sister's age: x - 2
* Mother's age: 3(x + 3) - 1

The sum of all their ages is 87, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

Simplifying the equation:

x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Combining like terms:

6x + 9 = 87

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

6x = 78

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 13


Therefore, the individual is 13 years old.

"This problem can be solved by setting up a system of equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has.  Let's denote Fawn's books as 'F', Anne's books as 'A', and Sofie's books as 'S'.

We know the following:

* F + A + S = 85 (The total number of books)
* S = A + 25 (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
* A = F - 12 (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to solve for F:

F + (F - 12) + ( (F - 12) + 25) = 85

Simplifying the equation:

F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85

3F + 1 = 85

3F = 84

F = 28



Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

Therefore, the thingamabob spins at 121 meters per second / 11 = 11 meters per second.

"Let's break down this problem like a case:

* **The Facts:** James is traversing a 20-mile lake. His initial speed is 2 miles per hour, and he covers 60% of the distance before taking a break. The rest period is half the duration of his initial swim.  He then completes the remaining distance at half his original speed.

* **The Issue:** We need to determine the total time James takes to cross the lake.

* **Analysis:**

    1. **First Leg:** He swims 12 miles (20 miles * 60%) at 2 miles per hour, taking 6 hours (12 miles / 2 miles per hour).

    2. **Rest:** His rest period is 3 hours (6 hours / 2).

    3. **Second Leg:** He swims the remaining 8 miles (20 miles - 12 miles) at 1 mile per hour (2 miles per hour / 2), taking 8 hours (8 miles / 1 mile per hour).

    4. **Total Time:** Adding the times for each leg and the rest, the total time is 17 hours (6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours).


**Conclusion:** James takes 17 hours to cross the lake.

"Based on the information provided, it appears there's a discrepancy in the map's accuracy.  It states the island had four times the number of holes at the end of the fourth day compared to the end of the first day. However, we can only account for a whole number of holes. 

Let's proceed with the available data:

* The pirates dug a total of 31 holes in the first three days (10 + 13 + 8).
* After filling in two holes, there were 29 holes remaining.
* The map indicates there should have been four times the number of holes at the end of the fourth day compared to the end of the first day.

"Let's analyze this situation. We know Teresa's earnings are derived from two sources: large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals.  The price of each type of stuffed animal is key to determining the quantity sold.

We're given the following:

* **Price of a small stuffed animal:** $4
* **Price of a large stuffed animal:** 3 * $4 = $12
* **Total earnings:** $120
* **Ratio of small to large stuffed animals sold:** 2:1

Let's represent the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. This means Teresa sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and her earnings from small stuffed animals would be 8x.

The total earnings equation is: 12x + 8x = $120

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120

Solving for x, we find x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the additional mileage Soledad needs to hike each day, we must first calculate her total mileage for June based on her current plan.  She plans to hike 250 miles per day (125 miles twice a day) for 30 days, resulting in a total of 7500 miles.  

Since her goal is to hike 9300 miles, she needs to increase her daily mileage by 1800 miles (9300 - 7500 = 1800) over the course of the month.  

Therefore, she must hike an additional 60 miles per day (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

"To determine the number of pizzas needed, we must first calculate the total slices required.  

Given that each of the six friends consumes six slices of cheese pizza and four slices of pepperoni pizza, the total consumption is:

* Cheese pizza: 6 friends * 6 slices/friend = 36 slices
* Pepperoni pizza: 6 friends * 4 slices/friend = 24 slices

Since each cheese pizza yields 12 slices and each pepperoni pizza yields 8 slices, the required number of pizzas is:

* Cheese pizzas: 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas
* Pepperoni pizzas: 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas

Therefore, a total of 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas are needed.

"This scenario presents a classic rate problem with a twist.  While the rate of snowball creation is straightforward, the melting factor introduces a variable loss that must be accounted for.  

To determine the time required to reach 60 snowballs, we need to establish the net gain in snowballs per unit of time.  

Given that Jay loses 2 snowballs every 15 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, he experiences a loss of 8 snowballs per hour (2 snowballs/15 minutes * 4 cycles per hour).

His net gain is then 12 snowballs per hour (20 snowballs created - 8 snowballs lost).

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to accumulate 60 snowballs (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours).

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, Tim will need 4 cups * 6 lemons per cup = 24 lemons for the standard lemonade.

The extra tart gallon requires twice the lemon juice, meaning 1 gallon * 2 = 2 cups of lemon juice.

This translates to 2 cups * 6 lemons per cup = 12 lemons for the extra tart gallon.

Therefore, Tim will need a total of 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.
