That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

Since there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding all the pets together, we get 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

"Here's how to figure out the total inner volume:

First, we need to find the size of the inside of each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each outside measurement:

* Inside length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
* Inside width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
* Inside height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now we can find the volume of one box:

* Volume = length x width x height = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

Finally, multiply that by 3 to find the total volume of all the boxes:

* Total volume = 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches

Since he watched 7 hours total, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday (1.5 / 0.5 = 3).

"Let's break down this salary problem step by step.

* Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah earned $100, Adrien earned $130.

* Four years ago, Adrien earned $40,000, so we can set up a proportion: $130 / $100 = $40,000 / Lylah's salary four years ago.

* Solving for Lylah's salary four years ago, we get $30,769.23 (approximately).

* Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000.

* Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so her new salary is $30,769.23 + (0.40 * $30,769.23) = $43,076.92 (approximately).

* Finally, their combined salary four years later is $56,000 + $43,076.92 = $99,076.92.

"Let's break down this crab conundrum!

* Bo has 40 crabs.
* Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, meaning Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Adding up all their crabs, we get 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

"Let's break this down.  There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). That's half the die's faces.  

To get two even numbers in a row, we need an even number on the first roll (3 out of 6 chances) and *then* another even number on the second roll (again, 3 out of 6 chances).  So, that's a 1 in 4 chance overall.

The difference between these probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is due to how much they had to start with.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now has four times as much, it means the big pool lost less water in proportion to the small pool.

Think of it like this: the offense and defense are the biggest parts of the team, and special teams is a smaller group.  Since there are twice as many on offense as defense, and half as many on special teams as defense, the defense is a key piece of the puzzle.

* Offense: 2 * d
* Special Teams: d / 2

* Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

* James swims 10% faster than Jon, so his swim time is 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

* James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

* Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

*  Therefore, James's run time is 160 minutes - 36 minutes - 85 minutes = 39 minutes.

"Let's calculate the total cost of the trip.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day rate due to the busy weekend. That means the increased cost per day is $1500 * 0.20 = $300.

For a 3-day stay, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost for tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

Here's how to figure it out:

Let's say there are 100 blue jelly beans. That means there are 99 red jelly beans (1% fewer) and 101 green jelly beans (1% more).

If 100 blue jelly beans represent a certain portion of the total, we can figure out what that portion is: 100 + 99 + 101 = 300 jelly beans.

This means 100 blue jelly beans represent 300/4500 = 1/15 of the total jelly beans.

Since there are 4500 jelly beans in total, there are 100 * 15 = 1500 blue jelly beans.

If we think of the triplets as a group, their combined age is represented by 3r (since each triplet is 'r' years old).

That means the two twins' combined age is 44 - 3r.

Since the twins are the same age, each twin is (44 - 3r) / 2 years old.

"Let's figure this out!  

They drank a lot of tea!  First, we need to find out how much tea everyone drank in total.  

* The first group drank 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.

That's a total of 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 quarts + 10 quarts = 48 quarts of tea.

Finally, there are 4 quarts in a gallon, so they started with 48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons of tea.

* His really good friend gets 1.5 times Jack's playtime, meaning 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.
* They play for 4 hours, which is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His two less-skilled friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* The skilled friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

"Let's break down the recipe.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Since she fills a 10-ounce jar, we can think of the ingredients like pieces of a puzzle that add up to 10.  

If we let the zest be represented by ""1 piece,"" then the fragrance is also ""1 piece."" The salt would be ""2 pieces"" (twice the zest), the sugar is also ""2 pieces,"" and the oil is ""4 pieces"" (twice the salt).

Adding all the pieces together: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10

We know the total number of cards is 341.  Let's use 'x' to represent the number of cards PJ has. Smendrick has three times that amount, or 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to figure out what 'x' is.  We know:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now we can find out how many cards Becca has:

3x + 12 = (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"Let's break down this age problem step by step.

* We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and John's ages.

To find Peter's age, we can use a bit of algebra. Let's say John's age is ""J"".  Then Paul's age is ""J + 10"", and Peter's age is ""J + J + 10"" which simplifies to ""2J + 10"".

Now, we know that:

J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms: 4J + 20 = 100

Subtracting 20 from both sides: 4J = 80

Dividing both sides by 4: J = 20

So, John is 20 years old.

Now we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = 2J + 10 = (2 * 20) + 10 = 50



Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's break down the widget production:

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, meaning it produces 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets daily. Over a month, that's 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 would bring in 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32400 * $6 = $194400.

* But, Maria's friends used some of that 34%, leaving only 28% in the end.
* That means her friends used 6% of the pie (34% - 28% = 6%).

6% represents about 17.65% of the original charge.

"Let's break this down. The ratio tells us there are 9 parts women for every 5 parts men.  That means the bus started with 9 parts women out of a total of 14 parts (5 + 9).

If there are 84 passengers total, each ""part"" represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

So, there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women remaining.

"Let's break down Faraday's sunflower sales.

He makes $2 per individual sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

Over three days, he earns $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, for a total of $82.

To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we divide his total earnings by his earnings per sunflower: $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold **12** sunflowers after 3 days.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  And, all three ropes together add up to 37 centimeters.

To find the length of the red rope, we can use a bit of algebra.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's call the length of the blue rope ""b"".
* The red rope is four times the blue rope, so it's 4 * b.
* The yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, so it's b + 7.

Now, if we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 5

So, the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.

Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

* The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

* He triples his money, meaning he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills (each worth $20).

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in the jar. The jar is a rectangular prism, so we find the volume by multiplying length x width x height: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we need to account for that 80% efficiency. That means we can only use 80% of the jar's volume: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

Now, divide the usable space by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

"Let's break this problem down.  

We know the total length of the board is 40 feet. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  

Think of it like this: if we divide the board into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece), each part would be 8 feet long (40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet/part).

Since the longer piece is made up of 4 of these parts, it's 32 feet long (4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet).

"Let's break this down. Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class. Since each person gets two treats, and there are five people, she needs 10 treats total.

Let's say Carly makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes three times that many brownies, minus two, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) treats. We know this needs to equal 10.

So, c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we get 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides, we have 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4 gives us c = 3.

"Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we know Aaron, who runs twice as fast, finished his part in 16 minutes. This means Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs 1 mile in 4 minutes. Since Vanessa runs half as fast, she takes 8 minutes per mile.  Therefore, Vanessa took 4 miles * 8 minutes/mile = 32 minutes to complete her part.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* Dora is turning 12 in 3 years, so she's currently 9 years old.
* James is twice Dora's age, making him 18.
* John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37.
* John's youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the son is currently 5.
* In 3 years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Let's break this down. We know each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4.  If we have a total of 70 legs and 20 animals, we can figure out how many chickens there are.

Think of it like this: if all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40). That's less than our 70 legs, so we know we have some cows.

Each cow adds 2 extra legs compared to a chicken. We need to find the difference between 70 and 40, which is 30. Since each cow adds 2 extra legs, we have 15 cows (30 / 2 = 15).

If we have 15 cows, we have 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).
