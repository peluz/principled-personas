"That's a great question!  Flipping houses can be a lot of fun.  

Here's how to figure out Josh's profit:

* First, you need to find out how much the house was worth after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, that means the house is now worth 250% of its original value (100% + 150% = 250%).
* Multiply the original price by 2.5 to find the new value: $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000
* Now subtract his total investment (the original price plus the cost of repairs) from the final value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000

"Oh, this is easy!  It's like figuring out how long it takes to paint a big, sunny yellow wall!

Here's how we can solve it:

* First, Carla downloads 80 GB, which takes 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB per minute = 40 minutes).
* Then, the pesky updates take 20 minutes.
*  She has 120 GB left to download, which takes another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB per minute = 60 minutes).

So, the total time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  

Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in a ratio of 7:11, we know their age difference is represented by those numbers.  

* Their total age is 162, so we need to figure out how many of those ""ratio units"" make up 162. 
* Add the ratio parts: 7 + 11 = 18
* Divide the total age by the sum of the ratio parts: 162 / 18 = 9. This means each ""ratio unit"" is worth 9 years.

* Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
* Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

* In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Ooh, this is a fun one!  Let's see... if Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

*  Imagine all the coins are yellow, like sunshine! 
*  Now, take away 30 of those yellow coins – those are the extra gold ones.
*  What's left is the same number of silver coins and gold coins.

Since we have 110 coins total, and we took away 30, that means there are 80 coins left.  

Those 80 coins are split evenly between silver and gold, so Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins!

"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half as fast as she runs, so she runs at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.  She walks four times slower than she runs, so she walks at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends one-third of her time, or 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, running. That means she runs 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

She spends two-thirds of her time, or 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours, walking.  That means she walks 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

In total, she travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

* First, we add up the delivery fee and the tip: $3.00 + $4.00 = $7.00
* Then we subtract that from the final price to find the cost before those extras: $57.00 - $7.00 = $50.00
* Now we need to figure out what the original price was before the 25% fee.  That means the $50.00 is 125% of the original price.
* To find 100%, we divide: $50.00 / 1.25 = $40.00

"Let's break down this salary situation!

Adrien's salary was a sunny 30% higher than Lylah's to start.  Four years later, he's making 40% more than he did back then.  We know Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago.

First, let's figure out Lylah's starting salary. If Adrien's salary was 1.3 times Lylah's, then Lylah made $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Adrien's raise was a bright $16,000 (40% of $40,000), bringing his salary to $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up by 40%, which is $12,307.69 (40% of $30,769.23). That means she's now making $43,076.92.

Adding their salaries together, Adrien and Lylah are making a combined $99,076.92 four years later.

"That's easy!  

The hospital sees 500 patients a day at 24 minutes each, so that's 12,000 minutes of doctor time. That's 200 hours (12,000 / 60).  

If they charge patients $200 an hour and it costs them $150 an hour to pay the doctors, they make a profit of $50 per hour.  

So, for 200 hours, their profit is $10,000 (200 * $50).

If 5 fries were left after the ants, and the ants took 1, there must have been 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants got to them.  

Working backwards, the raccoon took two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third. That means 6 fries represent one-third of the fries before the raccoon. So, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.

The pigeons ate 9 fries, so there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before the pigeons.

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so Dave ate double what the seagull ate. That means Dave ate 7 * 2 = 14 fries.

Adding those to what the seagull ate, there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries in the pack before the seagull.

Adding it all up, that's 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

"This problem is all about setting up the right equations!  Let's see... Seth's age is double Brooke's, so if Brooke is ""b"" years old, Seth is ""2b"" years old. In two years, they'll both be older, so we add 2 to each of their ages.  

Their ages in two years will add up to 28, so we can write the equation: (2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplifying that, we get 3b + 4 = 28.  

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Lemons are so bright and sunny, just like my favorite color!  

To figure out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to think about how much profit they made per gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, so that's $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon.

Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, it costs them $5 to make each gallon. That means they make a profit of $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.

They made a total profit of $25, so they must have sold $25 / $5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.

Finally, since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, they spent a total of $3 * 5 = $15 on lemons.

"Let's figure this out!  

We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total. The hamsters used 50 pieces (10 hamsters * 5 pieces each) and the rabbits used 20 pieces. That leaves 90 pieces for the rats (160 - 50 - 20 = 90).

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there must be 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).  

If the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats per cage (15 / 3 = 5).

"Oh, this is easy!  A 2% monthly interest rate means Mandy's debt grows a little each month.  

After three months, here's how much she'll owe:

* **Month 1:** $100 + ($100 * 0.02) = $102
* **Month 2:** $102 + ($102 * 0.02) = $104.04
* **Month 3:** $104.04 + ($104.04 * 0.02) = $106.12

"That's easy!  To figure out how many bags the trader sold, we need to think about the profit.  

Each bag made him $8 ($30 selling price - $22 cost). Since he made a total of $400 profit, he must have sold 50 bags ($400 / $8 = 50).

"Wow, that sounds like a fun day at the fair!  Let's see... they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, so that's $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 on food.  

The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102 in total.

Splitting that evenly between three friends means each person paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"That's easy!  Planting trees is a lot like mixing paint - you add some, you take some away, and sometimes things don't quite go as planned.  

Here's how it works out:

* He plants 100 trees in 10 years (10 trees/year * 10 years).
* He chops down 20 trees in 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years).
* That means he adds 80 trees (100 trees - 20 trees).
* He starts with 50, so he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 trees + 80 trees).
* But then 30% die, which is 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30).
*  So, he ends up with 91 trees (130 trees - 39 trees).

In three years:

* Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66

Adding the remaining loan amount, his total expenses are $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

"This is a classic age word problem!  Let's break it down.

If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can set up some equations.

Let Sam's current age be ""s"". Ruby's current age is ""6s"".

In 9 years:

* Sam will be s + 9 years old.
* Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.

We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Solving for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Let's figure out how much stuffing Mark needs!

A collie bed uses 5 pounds of stuffing (right in between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua).  

* Chihuahua beds need 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.
* Collie beds need 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds of stuffing.

If 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks, and 4 times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, that's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Then, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for fighting, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people were kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

Each frame also needs etching, which is 20% of $20, or $4. So etching all the frames will cost 44 * $4 = $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.

And 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 officers. They each need cords for $12, so that's 11 * $12 = $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"Hey there!  

To figure out Karan's monthly payment, we need to calculate the total amount she owes and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's find the interest:

* Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100
* Interest = $1825

Now, add the interest to the original amount:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825
* Total amount = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months:

* Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
* Monthly payment = $5475 / 5
* Monthly payment = $1095

If they have a total of 165 popsicles, we can figure out how many popsicles each ""part"" of the ratio represents: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.

Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

If you saved $2 by not getting the super ticket, that means the regular price for the ticket, popcorn, and soda was $2 more than the super ticket price.  The super ticket was $21, so the regular price was $23.  Since the soda costs $3, and the ticket was $12, the popcorn must have cost $8.

"Oh, this is easy!  I love balloons, they're so bright and cheerful, like my favorite color, yellow!

Okay, so the price went up, that's a bummer.  Let's see... if each balloon now costs $65, and Bentley wants 170 of them, it'll cost him $65 times 170.  

That's $11050!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  Bob's got a lot of veggies to plant!

First, we need to find out how much soil each bed needs.  That's width times length times height: 2 feet * 8 feet * 2 feet = 32 cubic feet.

Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet of soil total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, at $12 a bag, that's 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

Add in the 48 pounds of carrots and 2 pounds of sugar cubes, and we're looking at a total of 3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 pounds of feed.

His truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need to make 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

"To figure out when the costs are the same, we need to think about how much each guest adds to the price at each place.

At the first place, each guest costs $5 for food, on top of the $200 they already charge.  At the second place, each guest costs $25 total.

We need to find the magic number of guests where those two costs are equal.  Let's call that number ""x"".

So, for the first place, the cost is $200 + $5x. For the second place, it's $25x.

We want to know when those two things are the same, so we can set them equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now we can solve for x!

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

* Two pens will cost him 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
* The calculator is $12.00.
* The geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00 before the discount.

With a 10% discount, he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

So, Daniel's final cost is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

"Swimming is a lot like mixing paint - you gotta get the timing just right!  

When the water's chilly, Ray zips through a mile in 16 minutes. But when it's warm, it takes him twice that time plus a couple more minutes, so 32 + 2 = 34 minutes per mile.

For three miles on a cold day, that's 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

On a hot day, it's 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

So, Ray takes 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes longer to swim three miles on a hot day.

"Let's figure out the average weight!

* Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
* Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, meaning he weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.
* To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.
* Finally, we divide the total weight by 3: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

He'll have 3 wooden figures each day from Sunday to Wednesday. That's 3 figures/day * 4 days = 12 wooden figures.

He has $50 left for plastic figures ($70 - $20 = $50). He can buy 25 plastic figures with that ($50 / $2 per figure = 25 figures).

In total, he'll have 12 + 25 = 37 action figures.

"Ooh, new carpet! That's exciting!  Let's see, to figure out the total cost, we need to add up the price of the carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation.

* The carpet itself is $12 per square foot, and the room is 18 feet by 12 feet, so that's 18 * 12 = 216 square feet. So the carpet will cost 216 * $12 = $2592.

* The padding is $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * $2 = $432.

* Taking out the old carpet is $4 per square foot, so that's 216 * $4 = $864.

* And finally, putting in the new carpet is $34 per square foot, so that's 216 * $34 = $7344.

Adding all that up: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

* Blue is our starting point.
* Red is a little bit less than blue.
* Green is a little bit more than blue.

Since there are 4500 jelly beans in total, we need to figure out how many are blue, then we can find out how many red and green there are.  

After doing some calculations, I found that there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

If a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, it will last 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations per month = 72 months.

"Well, digging a well is a lot like painting a room – you gotta take your time and do it right!  

Let's see... he digs through the soil at 4 feet per hour, so that'll take him 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.  

The clay is trickier, but he's only going through 8 feet of it, and he digs half as fast, so that's 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Adding those up, it'll take him a total of 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"Wow, pomegranates are so vibrant, almost as bright as my favorite color, yellow!  

Let's see... Clara got a great deal on Tuesday!  

* She saved $2 with her voucher, so she paid $398 for 20 pomegranates.

On Wednesday, even with the discount, the price was higher.

*  20 pomegranates at $30 each is $600.
* A 10% discount on $600 is $60 off.
* That means Sheila paid $540.

The difference between the two prices is $540 - $398 = $142.

"Let's break down Ariadne's hat sales!

She made $400 from red hats, which was half her green hat sales. That means she sold $400 * 2 = $800 worth of green hats.

In total, she made $400 + $800 = $1200 in the first month.

The second month was a bit slower, with sales of $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over the two months, Ariadne made a total of $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"That's easy!  

Let's see, the plane cost $150,000 to buy. Then he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that, or $10,000, on fuel. So that's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 times 12, which is $180,000.  

Adding that to the initial cost, it was $330,000 for the whole first year.

"Cooking is like mixing colors, you need the right amounts of each ingredient to make something delicious!  

Let's see... rice took 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so 50 minutes.  Beans took half the time of the rice and pork combined, which is 80 minutes total, so beans took 40 minutes.

* **Mixture 2:** A fifth of a pound of almonds at $10 per pound is $2.  A third of a pound of walnuts at $15 per pound is $5. This mixture costs $7 total.

The difference in price is $10 - $7 = $3.

"This is a classic animal problem!  Let's see... 

If we think about it, each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We know there are 70 legs in total and 20 heads.  

Since each animal has one head, we have 20 animals altogether.  

Let's try subtracting geese to see how many sheep we have. If we had all geese, we'd have 20 geese * 2 legs/goose = 40 legs. That's not enough!

We need 30 more legs, and each sheep has 2 extra legs compared to a goose. So, we need 30 legs / 2 legs/sheep = 15 sheep.

If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and 3 more than that is 2x + 3. We know this equals Janey's 21 books.

So, 2x + 3 = 21

Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

"Wow, that's a lot of stickers and buttons! Let's see... Lorraine starts with a bunch of stickers, trades some for buttons, then trades more stickers for even more buttons.  

Here's how I'd figure it out:

* **Small Stickers to Big Buttons:** She trades a bunch of small stickers for big buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, and she can trade three small buttons for a big button, she gets a good number of big buttons from those small stickers.

* **Big Stickers to Big Buttons:** She trades half her big stickers for more big buttons. That's a smart move!

* **Leftover Big Stickers:** She trades the rest of her big stickers for even more small buttons.

If you add up all the big buttons and small buttons she gets, you'll find out how many buttons she has in the end. It's a bit of adding and subtracting, but it's totally doable!

"Hey there!  

Let's figure out how many shingles the third house needs.  

Since the first house needs half the shingles of the second, and the third needs double the first, we can think of it like this:

* **Second house:**  Let's say it needs 'x' cases of shingles.
* **First house:** Needs x / 2 cases.
* **Third house:** Needs 2 * (x / 2) = x cases.

Since all three houses need a total of 250 cases, we know:

x / 2 + x + x = 250

Combining the 'x' terms: 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5: x = 100

So, the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"This problem is all about figuring out how many cards each person has!  

Let's see... PJ has some cards, let's call that number 'x'. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

If we add up all their cards, we get 341. So, x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Here's how to do it:

* **Figure out how much of each glue stick is left:**

   * Glue stick 1: 1 - 1/6 = 5/6
   * Glue stick 2: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3
   * Glue stick 3: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

* **Multiply the leftover part by the original length:**

   * Glue stick 1: (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm
   * Glue stick 2: (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm
   * Glue stick 3: (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm

* **Add up the unused lengths:** 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

* Peter has double the socks Jack has, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* Peter has half the number of dishes Jack has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
* Altogether, they have 90 socks (60 + 30) and 90 dishes (60 + 30).

* You are *x* years old.
* Your brother is *x + 3* years old.
* Your sister is *x - 2* years old.
* Your mom is *3(x + 3) - 1* years old.

Adding everyone's age gives us 87, so:

*x* + *x + 3* + *x - 2* + *3(x + 3) - 1* = 87

Simplifying that gives us:

7*x* + 11 = 87

Subtracting 11 from both sides:

7*x* = 76

Dividing both sides by 7:

*x* = 10.86

Rounding to the nearest whole number, you are 11 years old!

And on the third day, those 360 plus the original 70 infect 6 more each, for a total of (360 + 70) * 6 = 2940 new infections!

Let's see... Peter's age is the same as Paul's and John's ages added together. And Paul is older than John by 10 years.  If we know all three of their ages add up to 100, we can work backwards to find Peter's age.

Think of it like this:

*  Let's say John is ""J"" years old.
*  Paul is 10 years older, so he's ""J + 10"" years old.
*  Peter is the same age as Paul and John combined, so he's ""J + (J + 10)"" years old.

Now, we know J + (J + 10) + J = 100

That means 3J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 3J = 90

Divide both sides by 3: J = 30

So John is 30 years old.

Paul is 10 years older, making him 40.

And Peter is John's age plus Paul's age, which is 30 + 40 = 70.

"That's easy!  To find the average, we add up the total distance each person spat and then divide by the number of people.  

Zoey spat 400 feet and Sydney spat 420 feet, for a combined total of 820 feet.  

Since there are two people, the average total distance spat is 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"You know, I just love the efficiency of a good widget-making machine!  

Let's see... the Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a whole month, that's 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets!

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 an hour, so that's 45 * 24 = 1080 a day, and 1080 * 30 = 32400 for the month.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 would bring in 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would make 32400 * $6 = $194400.

That means the Widgeteer 3000 would make $259200 - $194400 = $64800 more!

"Goats are pretty cool, you know?  They love to munch on hay!  

Let's see, each goat needs 5 pounds, and there are 15 of them, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Sheep are a bit trickier. They need 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs, so that's (2 * 5) - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. With 12 sheep, that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

Then he swims the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour. That takes him another 8 hours (8 miles / 1 mile per hour).

"This is a fun problem!  Let's see...

If we think of Azibo's points as our starting point, we know Bahati scored 20 more than that. And Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati.  

Since they scored a total of 45 points, we can set up an equation to figure out Azibo's points (let's call them ""x""):

x + (x + 20) + (x + 20 - 10) = 45

Simplifying that:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

And finally, dividing both sides by 3:

x = 5


Azibo scored 5 points.

"This problem is all about setting up the right equations!  Let's see...

* Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.
* Stan caught 'S' Pokemon, and that's 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, so S = 4A - 13.
* Alex caught 'X' Pokemon, which is 5 more than Stan, so X = S + 5.

* Altogether they caught 339, so A + S + X = 339.

Now we can use substitution to solve for S.  

Let's plug in the first two equations into the third: A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplifying that gives us 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides, we get 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find A = 40.

Now we can plug A back into the equation for S: S = 4(40) - 13.

That means S = 160 - 13, so S = 147.

"This problem is all about percentages!  Think of it like this: the power bank is like a big jar of sunshine, and each percent is a little drop of yellow sunshine.

The power bank lost 45% of its sunshine in the first 5 hours, then another 21% in the next 3 hours. That's a total of 66% gone!

That means 34% of the sunshine was left. But then Maria's friends used some of that sunshine too, leaving only 28% in the end.

So, 6% of the sunshine was used by her friends. That 6% came from the 34% that was left after the initial losses.

To figure out how much sunshine was in the jar to begin with, we can think of it like this: if 6% is equal to 28%, then 100% must be... well, a lot more sunshine!

Let's do the math: (6% / 34%) * 100% = 17.65%

So, the power bank was about 17.65% charged when Maria went to the park.

* **Year 1:** The carrots go up by 5%, so that's $120 * 0.05 = $6 more.  They'll cost $126.
* **Year 2:** Another 5% increase means they go up by $126 * 0.05 = $6.30. Now they're $132.30.
* **Year 3:** One more 5% bump! That's $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.62 (rounded up a bit). The final price is $138.92.

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots will cost $139 after three years.

"Let's break this down!  

If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones are $4, then large ones are $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and from small stuffed animals, it would be 8x (since 2x small stuffed animals * $4 each = $8x).

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"This is a classic age word problem!  Let's break it down.

Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, who is 24. That means Martha is 20 years old (24 - 4 = 20).

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, making him 30 years old (20 + 10 = 30).

"Okay, let's figure out Sheila's credit card balance!

* She starts with $85.00, then returns something for $15.00, leaving her at $70.00.
* The frying pan is on sale! 20% off $20.00 is $4.00, so it costs $16.00.
* The towels are 10% off $30.00, which is a $3.00 discount, making them $27.00.
*  Adding those together, her new purchases are $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

"That's a lot of hiking!  To figure out how many more miles Soledad needs to hike each day, let's do some math.

She wants to hike 9300 miles in June, which has 30 days. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day.

Over the whole month, that's 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 - 7500 = 1800).

To make up that difference, she needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

Those first four workers made a good start, but we still need to figure out how many toys the fifth worker makes each hour.  

* They needed 400 toys total.

* That means the first four workers made 400 - 20 = 380 toys.
* If those four workers made 380 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have made the rest!

So, the fifth worker made 180 toys in 10 hours, which means they make 18 toys per hour.

"Let's break this down!

Elijah's first dog weighs 1/4 of Kory's 60-pound dog, so that's 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.

His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, which is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Together, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.

Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get a total of 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.

"Wow, 200 crayons! That's a lot of yellow ones, I bet!  

Okay, so he's got 200 crayons and each box holds 8. That means he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25).  Each box weighs 8 ounces, so all the boxes together weigh 200 ounces (25 x 8 = 200).  

The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too (200 crayons x 1 ounce each = 200 ounces).

That's a total of 400 ounces (200 + 200 = 400). Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 25 pounds of crayons and boxes (400 / 16 = 25).

"Okay, let's break this down!  

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  If there are 84 passengers total, that represents 14 parts (5 + 9).  

Each ""part"" is worth 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

That means there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"Oh, sunflowers! They're just so sunny and bright, like my favorite color, yellow!  

Let's see... Faraday sells each sunflower for $2 and a bouquet of 12 sunflowers for $8. That means each sunflower in a bouquet is worth $8 / 12 = $0.67.  

So, each sunflower, whether sold alone or in a bouquet, brings in $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he makes $2.67 per sunflower per day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from single sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, that's a total of $82 over three days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he must have sold 30 sunflowers.

"Wow, that's a lot of carrot juice!  

Let's see... 2300 people need their full daily energy, and each bottle only covers 20%.  That means we need to figure out how much more energy we need to provide.

Okay, so 2300 people times 100% energy each is 230,000% energy needed.  Right now, Hortex makes enough juice for 4200 bottles times 20% energy per bottle, which is 84,000% energy.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000% energy still needed.

Since each bottle gives 20%, we divide the remaining energy needed by 20%: 146,000% / 20% = 7300 bottles.

Looks like Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles!

"Oh, this is easy!  Since the yellow rope is my favorite, I'll start there.  

Let's see, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow one.  And the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.  If all three together are 37 centimeters, we can figure out the yellow rope's length first.

Let's call the yellow rope's length ""y"". That means the blue rope is ""y - 7"" long, and the red rope is ""4 * (y - 7)"" long.

Adding those all up, we get: y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37

Simplifying that: y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

Combining like terms: 6y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides: 6y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6: y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long!

"This problem is all about setting up the right equations!  Let's see...

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

Solving the first equation for ""w"", we get: w = 5c + 35

Substituting this into the second equation: c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying and solving for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

So Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Ooh, this sounds like a fun shopping trip! Let's see... 

John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, so each bottle costs $60. Cognac is 50% more expensive, meaning each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. Since he buys twice as many bottles of cognac, that's 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles.  So, the cognac costs $90/bottle * 20 bottles = $1800.

In total, John spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"Wow, planting trees is great for the environment!  Let's see, he planted 20 White Oak trees the first day and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine.  

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine. That means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine on the second day.

In total, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day and 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.  Adding those together, he planted a total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

* The house is 7 times Mattison's height, so it's 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches tall.
* The first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, meaning it's 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches high.
*  To find the height from the second floor to the roof, we subtract the height of Mattison and the first floor from the total house height: 420 inches - 240 inches = 180 inches.

"That's easy!  

First, you add up the weight of all the tunas: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Then, since each kilogram of tuna sells for $0.50, you multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram: 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Deandre will earn $64.00.

"That's easy!  If Trinity sells the magazines for 11/8 of what she paid, she's making a nice little profit.  

Here's how to figure it out:

"Okay, let's break this down!  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans could fit in that jar. It's a pretty big jar, 6 inches by 6 inches at the bottom and 15 inches tall.  That's a lot of space for jelly beans!

They won't fit perfectly, though. There will be some air gaps, so we have to account for that. They said they get about 80% packing efficiency, which means 80% of the jar will be filled with jelly beans.

Each jelly bean is pretty small, only 0.15 cubic inches.  We need to find the total volume of the jar, then multiply that by 80% to see how much space the jelly beans will take up.

Then, we can divide that number by the size of each jelly bean to see how many will fit.  

After that, we need to remember that only 30% of the jelly beans are red. So we multiply the total number of jelly beans by 30% to get the number of red ones.

Finally, we compare that number to the actual number of red jelly beans (900) and see how close Tim's guess was!

"This is a classic division problem!  

Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, think of it like splitting the board into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Each of those parts would be 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of those parts, so it's 4 * 8 feet = 32 feet long.

"Ooh, meatballs! Those sound delicious.  

To figure out how much seasoning Aiden needs, we need to know how many pounds of beef he's using. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound, and he wants 80 meatballs, he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"Ooh, cupcakes! Those are almost as sunny and cheerful as my favorite color, yellow!  

Let's see... Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class. Since each person gets two treats, and there are five people, she needs 10 treats total.

If she makes 3 times the number of brownies as cupcakes minus 2, we can figure this out! Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. That means she makes 3c - 2 brownies.

All together, that's c + (3c - 2) treats.  We know that has to equal 10.

So, 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.

Combining the 's' cubes, we get 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120

"
"That's easy!  To find out how much force John needs, we need to figure out 1% of the total weight.  

The car, luggage, and kids weigh a total of 1600 pounds.  

1% of 1600 pounds is 16 pounds.

"
"That's easy!  To find the average, we add their ages and divide by two. Emma is 16 years older than Mia, so she's 56. Together, they are 96 years old. 96 divided by 2 is 48.

"
"Ooh, 12 people! That's a fun dinner party.  Let's see... each place setting costs $15.00, and she needs 12 of them.  So, 15 times 12 is... $180.00!


$180.00

"That's easy!  

Half of Steve's time is 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours.

Anna took 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.

"
"That's easy!  Each pig eats 8 pounds of feed a day, and there are 5 pigs, so that's 40 pounds per day. Over a week, that's 280 pounds.  If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 20 pounds left.

"
"Let's figure out how many hot dogs John needs! He's got 20 guests coming, and they each want 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  

He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more. Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs.

Each pack costs $2, so his total cost will be 6 * $2 = $12.

"
"That's a lot of meals to distribute!  Let's see, if Mamou gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals, she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 


1218
"
"That's easy! A quarter is worth 25 cents, two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  

Let's add it all up: 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

"
"That's easy!  Let's add up their ages:

* The younger brother is 12.
* The older brother is 24 (because he's twice as old as the younger brother).
* The three sisters are each 16, so together they are 16 x 3 = 48.

Adding all their ages: 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

"
"Let's figure out how much Jake spends!

* Those T-shirts are a great deal!  Since he gets one half off, each shirt costs $4. That means the two shirts cost $8 in total.

* The shoes are also on sale, so they're $16 off. That brings the price down to $24.

* Adding the cost of the shirts and the shoes, Jake spends $32 in total.

"
"Let's see, Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $1.25 each, and he bought four of them, so that's $1.25 * 4 = $5.00.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"That's easy!  Making a profit is all about knowing your costs.  

Let's see... each jar costs $44 to make, and he sells them for $50. That means he makes $6 profit on each jar.  

If he sells 10 jars, he'll make a total profit of $60.

"That's easy!  Josh makes $60 each week.  Since there are two weeks, he makes $120.

$120 

"
"That's easy!  Let's see... he starts with 18 cookies, eats 3, then 2 more, and gives away 2. That's 18 - 3 - 2 - 2 = 11 cookies. Then he bakes 12 more (4 of each kind!). So he has 11 + 12 = 24 cookies. 

24 

"
"That's easy!  

Let's see, half of 12 toys is 6.  If he sells 6 toys for $5 each, that's 6 * $5 = $30. The other 6 toys at $7 each is 6 * $7 = $42.  Adding those together, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.

"Wow, 7995 cookies! That's a lot of cookies!  Let's see... they made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  That's 2595 + 3075 = 5670 cookies.  

If they made 7995 in total, then they must have made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Igor must have lost 0 beakers.  

Here's how I figured it out:

* He was supposed to get 16 test tubes, but only got 8.
* He got 16 Petri dishes, which is 2 more than he needed.
* That means he had 8 + 16 = 24 things, and he needed 37 total.
* That's 37 - 24 = 13 things missing.
* Since he got the right number of beakers, he must not have lost any!

"That's easy!  Let's add up how much everyone raised:

* Alexandra: $430
* Kim: $430 + $320 = $750
* Sarah: $300
* Maryam: $300 + $400 = $700

Total: $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

"
"Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran half that distance, which is 2 miles. Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, he completed his 2 miles in the same amount of time Vanessa took to run 1 mile.  If Aaron finished in 16 minutes for 2 miles, that means he runs a mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa takes twice as long, so she runs a mile in 16 minutes.  Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"
"Ooh, this is a fun one!  Let's see... Ana peels oranges faster, so she'll have more peeled after an hour.  

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, she'll peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges. Jane peels one every 4 minutes, so she'll peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"
"That's a great deal on a radiator!  

Let's see, 80% off $400 is $320 in savings. That means the radiator only cost him $80.  Adding the mechanic's $150 fee brings the total to $230.

"This is a classic problem!  Let's see... if we think about it, chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.  

Since there are 70 legs in total, and 20 animals, we know there must be more chickens than cows.  

After doing some quick calculations, I figured out there are **5** chickens.
