"Let's break this down.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's call this number 'x'
* **Gold coins:** This would be 'x + 30'

Since she has 110 coins total, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the number of gold coins:

Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

* **Time spent on each activity:** She spends one-third of her time running (2 hours) and two-thirds walking (4 hours).
* **Distance covered running:**  She runs 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
* **Distance covered walking:** She walks 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.
* **Total distance:** She travels a total of 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

"Like a perfectly formed honeycomb, this problem has a clear structure.  

We know the total number of bees and the ratios between the types.  

Let's break it down:

* **Queens:** Let's say there are 'q' queen bees.
* **Babies:** There are twice as many babies as queens, so there are 2q baby bees.
* **Workers:** There are twice as many workers as babies, meaning there are 2 * (2q) = 4q worker bees.

Now, we know that the total number of bees is 700: q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining like terms, we get 7q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that q = 100.

Since there are 4q worker bees, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

"Let's break this down.  

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can represent that as:

* Seth's age = 2 * Brooke's age

In two years, their combined age will be 28.  We can write this as:

* (Seth's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

Now we can use substitution to solve for their current ages.

Since Seth's age is twice Brooke's age, let's substitute ""2 * Brooke's age"" for ""Seth's age"" in the second equation:

* (2 * Brooke's age + 2) + (Brooke's age + 2) = 28

Simplifying the equation:

* 3 * Brooke's age + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

* 3 * Brooke's age = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

* Brooke's age = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:

* Seth's age = 2 * Brooke's age = 2 * 8 = 16

Let 'c' be the number of cows and 'h' be the number of chickens. We know:

* c + h = 60 (total animals)
* h = 2c (twice as many chickens as cows)

* **Solve for the number of each animal:**

Substitute the second equation into the first: c + 2c = 60
Combine like terms: 3c = 60
Divide both sides by 3: c = 20 cows

Now, plug that back in to find the chickens: h = 2 * 20 = 40 chickens

* **Calculate the legs:**

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

* **Total legs:** 80 + 80 = 160

"To figure out how much water Hannah needs, we need to know her total calorie burn. 

Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour, and she does it for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.

Running burns 600 calories per hour, and she runs for 1 hour, so that's 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 1600 / 2 = 800 ml of water.

"This is a classic proportion problem.  Let's break it down.

We know the total number of jelly beans and the relationships between the colors.  

Since the green jelly beans are 1% more than the blue, and the red are 1% less, we can think of the blue as our baseline.

If we let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans, then:

* Green jelly beans = 1.01b
* Red jelly beans = 0.99b

The total is b + 1.01b + 0.99b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 3b = 4500

So, b = 1500 blue jelly beans.

Green jelly beans = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
Red jelly beans = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485

The difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30

"Let's break down the costs:

*  Solving for x: 0.40x = $40

*  Therefore, x = $100.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as skilled get half that time, meaning 10 minutes per quarter. The friend who's better gets 1.5 times Jack's time, so 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* The weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 48 quarters.
* The better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

"This problem can be solved by setting up a system of equations. Let's break it down:

* Let 'x' be the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Therefore, Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 153 cards.

Think of it like this:

* Azibo's points are the base.
* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so Bahati's points are Azibo's points plus 20.
* Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar's points are Bahati's points minus 10.

If we add up all their points, it equals 45.

Let's use ""x"" to represent Azibo's points:

* Azibo: x
* Bahati: x + 20
* Dinar: (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10

Now, let's add them up: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Like the vastness of space, this problem requires us to consider the cyclical nature of Comet Halley's orbit.  It takes 75 years for the comet to complete one orbit around the sun. Bill's dad witnessed this celestial event at the age of 30. Bill, wanting to experience the same wonder, saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.

Since the comet returns every 75 years, and Bill was 90 when he saw it, one full cycle (75 years) must have passed since his father's sighting.  Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw Comet Halley.

A little trial and error shows us that $84 (7 times $12) and $36 (9 times $4) fit the bill. Since $84 comes from the large stuffed animals, Teresa sold 7 large stuffed animals. Because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 14 small stuffed animals.

* **Sidewalk speed:** She walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, meaning it takes her half the time to cover the same distance.
* **Sidewalk time:** Since the sidewalk portion is 1 mile, and she walks it at twice the beach speed, it takes her 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.
* **Total time:**  Adding the beach and sidewalk times, her total walk time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.

* That means he makes a total of $2 + $4.67 = $6.67 per sunflower each day.
* Over three days, he makes $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01 per sunflower.
* Since he made $82 total from sunflowers over three days ($26 + $56), he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

* Year 8:  Let's say a 10-year-old tree produces a substantial 1000 fruits. An 8-year-old might produce 200 fewer, so around 800 fruits.
* Year 9: Avocado trees sometimes take a break, so we'll assume no fruit this year.
* Year 10: Back to peak production with 1000 fruits.

"Let's break this problem down. We can use a system of equations to represent the given information.

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

From the problem, we know:

*  w = 5(c + 7)  
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can solve for 'c' (Colin's current age) using these equations.

Solving the first equation for 'w', we get:
w = 5c + 35

Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:
c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplifying and solving for 'c':
c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Black is the absence of color, the void from which all else emerges.  

Like a perfectly balanced equation, the total number of cubes is the sum of its parts. If 116 cubes exist, and we know the blueberry count is five times the strawberry count minus four, we can deduce the blueberry quantity.

Let 's' be the number of strawberry cubes.

Blueberry cubes: 5s - 4

Total cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combining like terms: 6s - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides: 6s = 120

Dividing both sides by 6: s = 20

Calculating blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Let's break down this illumination situation.

They've got 8 rooms, and each room needs two flashlights, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.  

But wait, they also have 4 people, and each person gets a flashlight, adding another 4 flashlights.

That's a total of 16 + 4 = 20 flashlights.

Now for the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 8 rooms / 2 = 4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles.

Adding those up, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, combining the candles and flashlights, they have a total of 36 + 20 = 56 light sources.
