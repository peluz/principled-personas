"Well, let's see. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them a total of 60 cups.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Let's break down the cost:

* Since every second glass is 60% off, Kylar gets a deal on half of the glasses.
* He's buying 16 glasses, so that's 8 pairs.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Carla loses 40 minutes to that pesky Windows update.  Since she was 40% of the way through, she's gotta start over. That means she's downloading the whole 200 GB again.

At 2 GB per minute, that's 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes of pure download time.

Adding in the lost time, the total is 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Alright, let's break down Eliza's earnings.  

She gets $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

For the extra 5 hours, she gets time-and-a-half, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 an hour.

So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding it all up, Eliza made $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hey there!  

Let's break this down.  

Month 2 had three times the downloads of month 1, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.

Month 3 saw a 30% drop from month 2, meaning they lost 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads.

That leaves month 3 with 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"Let's break this down.  If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling half her remaining stock to the orange house, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the orange house.

Then, she sold 2 to the red house, meaning she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before that.

Finally, she sold a third of her original amount to the green house.  That means two-thirds of her starting amount is 12, so she started with 12 / (2/3) = 18 vacuum cleaners.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

If 20% of the students are doing contemporary, that's 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students. That leaves 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students are into jazz, so that's 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students.

That means 16 students - 4 students = 12 students are doing hip-hop.

So, 12 students out of 20 are hip-hop dancers, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.

"Well, let's see here.  You've got 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of that is water, so that's 6.67 liters of water.  Then you've got 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, which is 9 liters.  

You spill a liter of the orange drink, leaving you with 9 liters.  Adding that to the pineapple drink, you have a total of 24 liters.  The total water in those 24 liters is 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters.

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* Marie spent $12 on the chicken meal, $15 on milk, and $6 on apples, totaling $33.

"
"Let's break down the cost:

* Mishka spent $16.50 per pair of shorts, and she bought 3 pairs, so that's 16.50 * 3 = $49.50 on shorts.
* Pants cost $22.50 each, and she got 3 pairs, totaling 22.50 * 3 = $67.50.
* Shoes were $42 per pair, and she bought 3, making the shoe cost 42 * 3 = $126.00.

Adding up all the costs: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

"
"Let's break this down. The more expensive heels cost twice as much as the cheaper pair, so they're $33 * 2 = $66.  Together, the heels cost $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.

"
"Let's break this down.  The ratio 7:11 tells us that for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

Since their ages add up to 162, we can think of their combined age ratio as 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18).

Each ""part"" of the ratio represents 162 / 18 = 9 years.

This means Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Let's break down the jelly bean guesses:

* Friend 1: 80 jelly beans
* Friend 2: 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess, so (80 / 2) + 20 = 60 jelly beans
* Friend 3: 25% more than Friend 1's guess, so 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans

To find the average, we add up the guesses and divide by 3: (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 80 jelly beans

"Well, to figure out John's speed, we need to know his total running time and the distance he covers.  

He runs 60 miles a week spread over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs half that time, which is 1.5 hours each. That's a total of 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours of running per week.

Since he runs 60 miles in 6 hours, his speed is 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour. 


10 

"
"Let's break this down. Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours). That means she covers 12 miles running (6 miles/hour * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

In total, Dana travels 18 miles.

In the second half of the year, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, totaling $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

Then the boy got 6 liters, so altogether they used 8 liters + 6 liters = 14 liters.

That means there were 24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters left.

"Let's see... Charlie started with 10 stickers, got 21 more, and then 23 more for his birthday. That's 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers!  He gave away 9 and used 28, so he has 54 - 9 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

"Let me see... Grace weighs 125 pounds, and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  So, Alex weighs 4 * 125 - 2 = 498 pounds.

"Well, that's easy!  If each rose bush has 25 roses and there are 8 thorns on each rose, that's 25 * 8 = 200 thorns per bush. With 3 bushes, we have a total of 200 * 3 = 600 thorns.

"Let's break this down. If they won 8 more games than they lost, and played a total of 22 games,  we can figure this out.  

Think of it like this:

* **Wins:**  Let's call this ""W""
* **Losses:** Let's call this ""L""

We know:

* W + L = 22 (total games)
* W = L + 8 (they won 8 more than they lost)

If we plug the second part into the first part, we get:

(L + 8) + L = 22

That means 2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2: L = 7

Now we know they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 + 60 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding them all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we need to find the space inside the box, not including the walls.  

* The inside length is 5 inches (outer) minus 2 inches (for both walls) = 3 inches.
* The inside width is 6 inches (outer) minus 2 inches (for both walls) = 4 inches.
* The inside height is 4 inches (outer) minus 2 inches (for both walls) = 2 inches.

That means each box has an inner volume of 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  We know she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, meaning her speed is 1.25 feet per second. To reach the shore, which is 64 seconds away, she'll travel 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she travels 80 feet, and the boat takes on 2 liters every 10 feet, the total water intake is (80 feet / 10 feet/intake) * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Lumber prices going up 50% is a nice little bonus for Sasha! 

She's got 10 of those 2x4x10 boards, which originally cost her $10 each. That's $100 total for those. Now they're worth $15 each, so she can sell them for $150.

Then there are the 4x4x10 boards. Five of those at $16 each is $80 she spent. With the price bump, they're worth $24 each, bringing her $120 if she sells them all.

Adding up her earnings, she'd make $150 + $120 = $270.

Since she spent $100 + $80 = $180 on the lumber originally, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

"Alright, let's break this down.  A ratio of 7:13 means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out what part of that 120 represents the 7 parts sugar.

Think of it like this: 7 + 13 = 20.  So, each ""part"" of the ratio is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar is 7 parts, she used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break down this salary situation.

Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago, so that's his $130. To find Lylah's original salary, we divide: $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Fast forward four years, and Adrien's salary increased by 40%, which is a boost of $16,000 ($40,000 x 0.40). His new salary is $56,000.

Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, which is $12,307.69 ($30,769.23 x 0.40). Her new salary is $43,076.92.

"Well, this is a classic beehive population problem!  Here's how we can figure out the number of worker bees:

Let's think of it like this:

* If there are 'q' queen bees, there are twice as many baby bees, or '2q'.
* And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are '2 * 2q' or '4q' worker bees.

Knowing that the total number of bees is 700, we can set up an equation:

* q + 2q + 4q = 700

Combining the 'q' terms:

* 7q = 700

Dividing both sides by 7:

* q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queen bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

* 4q = 4 * 100 = 400



There are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"Hey there!  Let's see... Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures, and Locsin caught some too.  

* Anakin had 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 sea creatures.
* Locsin had 5 starfish + 3 seahorses + 5 clownfish = 13 sea creatures.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 sea creatures!

"Let's break this down. The price goes up by 20% every two months. That means every two months, the marbles will cost 120% of what they cost before. Over 36 months, there are 18 of these two-month periods.  

So, we start with $20 and multiply by 1.20 eighteen times. That's a lot of multiplying!  

$20 * 1.20 ^ 18 = $92

"Let's figure this out!

* Each action figure costs $5, so 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.
* The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it's also worth $15.
* The red cars cost $4 each, and there are 5, so they cost a total of 5 * $4 = $20.

Adding up the cost of everything: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50

"Let's break this problem down.  If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can think of Brooke's age as one ""unit"" and Seth's age as two ""units"". In two years, each of them will be one year older, so we'll add one to each ""unit"".

That means in two years, they'll have a total of three ""units"" (Brooke's unit + 1) plus two ""units"" (Seth's unit + 1), which equals five ""units"". We know these five ""units"" add up to 28 years.

So, one ""unit"" (Brooke's age) is 28 / 5 = 5.6 years old.

Seth is twice Brooke's age, so he is 5.6 * 2 = 11.2 years old.

Peeling takes the longest, at a minute and a half per potato. That's 90 minutes total for peeling (60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes).

Cutting is much faster, only 5 seconds per potato. That's 5 minutes total (60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes).

Adding the peeling and cutting time together, Billy will spend 95 minutes prepping those potatoes.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, you need to roll an even number, then another even number. Each of those has a 50% chance, so the chance of both happening is 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

That means rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there must be 15 rats (90 / 6 = 15).  

If the rats are in 3 cages, there are 5 rats per cage (15 / 3 = 5).

"Well, let's see here. Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, so after 10 years he's planted 100 more trees (10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees).  But he also chops down 2 trees each year, so he loses 20 trees over those 10 years (2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees).

That means he has 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 100 - 20 = 130).  But then 30% of those die, which is 39 trees (130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees).

So, Tom ends up with 91 trees (130 - 39 = 91).

"Let's break this problem down.  We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in their water levels is due to how much they had to start with.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool four minutes ago, and now has four times as much, it means the big pool lost less water in proportion to the small pool.  

Thinking about it this way, the small pool must have lost a significant amount of water in those four minutes.  

If we work backwards, knowing the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool, the small pool must have 8 gallons now.

"Let's break this down. John has 54 candies, and that's twice the amount Robert has. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, meaning he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.  

John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"
"Well, let's see. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but now he only has 3.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back. That means he's writing and receiving 6 letters a week from each pal, for a total of 18 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 90 pages a week. If he writes a page every 6 minutes, that's 90 pages * 6 minutes/page = 540 minutes of writing.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 540 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 9 hours writing each week.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Jason uses 15 minutes a day for his boss, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. Add that to the extra 300 minutes he's used, and he's used a total of 750 minutes. Since his plan has 1000 minutes, he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, the makeup artist charges $250 an hour and it takes 6 hours a day, that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 a week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, making the total cost before the discount $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $30000 * 0.10 = $3000 off.

So, the final price Jean pays is $30000 - $3000 = $27000.


$27000 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much each person paid.

First, we add up all the costs: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

"Alright, let's break this down.  Sue ate a lot of cookies!

* On Monday, she ate 4 times her sister's 5 cookies, so that's 20 cookies.
* On Tuesday, she ate double her sister's 13 cookies, meaning 26 cookies.

That's a total of 46 cookies for Sue. Her sister ate 18 cookies total.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"Let's figure this out!

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, who went 30 times. That means Anne went down 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times.

So Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as many times as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.

"Well, let's see.  If each of the ten stalls started with 20 cows, that's 200 cows in total. Then Mr. Sylas adds another 40 cows, bringing the total to 240.  Now, with 240 cows spread evenly across 20 stalls, each stall has 12 cows.  So, in 8 stalls, there would be 8 stalls * 12 cows/stall = 96 cows.

"Let's break this down. If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

In total, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

Together they have 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"Alright, let's break down Mr. Tan's house sale.  

First, we need to figure out his total expenses. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.03 = $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5%, so that's $400,000 * 0.05 = $20,000.  Adding those together and the loan repayment, his total expenses are $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract the expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

"Let's break down this knitting project.  

The collar uses 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette is double the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 stitches - 1170 stitches) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Let's break this down.  Scene one has twice the lines of the song, so that's 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But Sean only has a third of those, meaning he needs to learn 108 / 3 = 36 lines. Scene two is six lines longer than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  He has four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.  

Adding it all up, Sean has to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

Half of those have a B, so that's 24 cards (48 / 2 = 24). That leaves 24 cards (48 - 24 = 24).

Then 5/8 of those have a C, which is 15 cards (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Finally, the rest must have a D, so that's 9 cards (24 - 15 = 9).

"Let's break this problem down.  If Ruby is 6 times older than Sam now, and in 9 years she'll be 3 times as old as Sam, we can set up a couple of equations to figure out Sam's current age.

Let's say Sam's current age is ""s"". That means Ruby's current age is ""6s"".

In 9 years, Sam will be ""s + 9"" years old, and Ruby will be ""6s + 9"" years old. We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Now we can solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old.

That means all the cobras have a total of 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots.

And all the mambas have 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.

Adding those together, we get 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots in total.

Half of that is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Well, let's see.  Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. That means one truck can carry 2000 / 75 = 26.67 flagstones. Since we can't have a fraction of a flagstone, each truck can carry 26 flagstones.  They need to deliver 80 flagstones, so they'll need 80 / 26 = 3.08 trucks.  You can't have part of a truck, so they'll need 4 trucks to get all the flagstones there in one trip.

"Well, let's see. If 22 men stayed, and there were 25 men to begin with, that means 3 men left.  That's 1/4 of the total people who left.  Since there were 40 people at the start, 10 people left in total.  

If 10 people left, and 3 were men, then 7 women must have left. That leaves 8 women at the party.

"Let's figure this out!

If Jam has 26 pencils and 2 are loose, that means she has 24 pencils in boxes. Since those pencils are split evenly among 3 boxes, each box holds 8 pencils.

Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

To store all those pencils, they'd need 72 / 8 = 9 boxes.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. To get a 65-degree drop, she'll need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes. That's 5 cubes * 12 milliliters/cube = 60 milliliters weaker from the ice alone. Add in the 15 milliliters from the cream, and her iced coffee is a total of 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker.

"
"Well, let's see. If they got 7 new records and each trade gets you one new record, that means there were 7 trades.  Since each trade needs 2 old records, they must have brought in 7 trades * 2 old records/trade = 14 old records.

"Alright, let's break down this payroll situation. 

We know 40 out of the 100 employees are junior programmers making $2000 each. That's a total of $80,000 for the junior programmers.

The senior programmers make $400 more, putting them at $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, their total salary is $144,000.

Adding those together, the company shells out $224,000 per month for all their programmers.

"Let's break this down.  We know 20 people were on the bus before the third stop, and 7 got off at the second stop. That means there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus before the second stop. Then 8 more got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people on the bus after the first stop. Finally, 5 people got on at the first stop, leaving 19 - 5 = 14 people who started at the terminal.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Job A is straightforward: $15 an hour for 2000 hours is $30,000.  With a 20% tax rate, that leaves Nick with $24,000.

Job B is a bit trickier.  First, we take the $6,000 property tax off the top, leaving $36,000. Then, 10% tax on that is $3,600, leaving him with $32,400.

Looks like Job B nets Nick an extra $8,400.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Maria starts with an investment of $64.  The first year, her stock jumps up 50%, so that's a gain of $32 (50% of $64).  That brings her total to $96.  

The second year, the stock takes a hit, dropping 25%. That's a loss of $24 (25% of $96).

"Let's see... Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so he ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"
"Let's break this down.  If two groups are the same size, and the third is smaller by 10, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the two bigger groups combined have '2x' students.
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 200 students. So, 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides gives us 3x = 210

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 70.

That means the smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students. 


60
"
"Well, this is a classic!  Let's see... 60 animals, twice as many chickens as cows.  

* If we call the number of cows ""C"", then there are ""2C"" chickens.
* That means C + 2C = 60 animals total.
* Combining like terms, we get 3C = 60.
* Dividing both sides by 3, we find C = 20 cows.
* That means there are 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 cow legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 chicken legs.

Adding those together, we get a grand total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs on the farm.

"Well, let's see. Josh starts with 3 balls and adds one each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.  He drops 3, but 2 come back, leaving him with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.

* Blue beetle: 50 pounds (same as the frog)
* Green toad: 50 pounds (same as the frog)
* Yellow snake: 60 pounds (10 pounds more than the frog)
* Red bird: 30 pounds (20 pounds less than the frog)

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"Let's break this down.  

John spent 15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows. That's 30% of his total vacation time.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

He spent 40% of that time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Annabelle needs $400 and already has $80. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Her first job will earn her $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

Her second job will earn her $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

That's a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she'll have $275 + $80 = $355.

So, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

"Well, let's see here.  The train travels 75 miles plus 100 miles, which is 175 miles one way. Coming back, it travels 175 miles minus 50 miles, so that's 125 miles.  That makes a total of 300 miles for a round trip.  

If it does that three times a day, that's 900 miles a day.  To figure out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service miles by the daily miles: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Alright, let's figure out the total cost of these senior gifts. 

* We've got 44 seniors getting picture frames at $20 each, so that's 44 * $20 = $880.
*  Each frame also needs etching, which adds 20% to the cost, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  
*  That means etching will cost 44 * $4 = $176 in total.
* Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
*  A quarter of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
* Each officer gets a cord for $12, so that's 11 * $12 = $132.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  A quadruple batch needs four times the ingredients. So that's 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, Mark needs 6 bags (12 / 2 = 6). He'll need 2 bottles of milk (4 / 2 = 2). That means he needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Mel's saving 5 hours of AC use per day, and that AC is a 900-watt model. So, he's saving 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours every day.  

That's the same as 4.5 kilowatt-hours (since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt). Over 30 days, that adds up to 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"Well, let's see. Two zebras with 17 stripes each is 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.  Then we have another zebra with 36 stripes and one with 36 / 2 = 18 stripes. That's a total of 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.  

Since there are 4 zebras, the average is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes per zebra.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

We need enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so that's 5 sandwiches total. Each sandwich needs a pound of meat and a pound of cheese.  So, we're looking at 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

Meat is $7 a pound, so that's 5 * $7 = $35. Cheese is $3 a pound, so that's 5 * $3 = $15.

Adding those together, the total cost is $35 + $15 = $50.00

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Toby's got a 45-page book with 200 words on each page, so that's 9000 words total. He reads 300 words a minute, meaning it'll take him 30 minutes to finish the book.

He took a break for a day, and then in the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

"Let's break this down. Kenny wants to buy a $100 ticket and has $50 left over, meaning he made $50 from selling his cards.  Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold 50 / 1.50 = 33.33 cards. Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards and sold 2/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards.

"Well, let's see. If the caterer planned for half the guests to have two hot dogs, that's 36 / 2 = 18 guests getting two hot dogs.  That's 18 * 2 = 36 hot dogs right there.  He also made enough for the other half to have one, so that's another 18 hot dogs. In total, he had 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.

But then 40 guests showed up!  That means only enough for 54 / 2 = 27 guests to get a second hot dog.  So, 40 - 27 = 13 guests missed out on a second hot dog.

Jon's total time is 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes.

James is 10% faster swimming, so he takes 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

He's 5 minutes slower on the bike, for a time of 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 minutes - 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

"Let's break this down. If Jillian's shoes cost $80, and her bag cost $20 less than three times that amount, we can calculate the bag's price like this:

* Three times the shoe price: 3 * $80 = $240
* $20 less than that: $240 - $20 = $220

Her bag cost $220.

"It will take him 4 days to save up the rest of the money. 

"
"Let's see... Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray holds 24.  That means two trays can hold 48 eggs (2 x 24 = 48).  He'll have 16 eggs leftover (64 - 48 = 16).

"Let's break it down:

The family-size pizza costs three times the small pizza, so it costs $8 * 3 = $24.

In total, Sally spends $8 + $24 = $32.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Two packs of razors at four razors a pack means she's getting eight razors total.  The buy one get one free deal means she's essentially paying for two packs, but getting four packs worth of razors.  

So, the razors cost $4.00 a pack, and she's buying two, for a total of $8.00.  Then, she subtracts the $2.00 coupon, bringing the cost down to $6.00.

That means each razor costs $6.00 / 8 razors = $0.75.  

To get the answer in cents, we multiply by 100, giving us 75 cents.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We've got nine cheerleaders at 64 inches tall, and one at 60 inches.  That means the base of our pyramid is going to be pretty tall!  

Let's see... 9 cheerleaders times 64 inches is 576 inches. Add in the shortest cheerleader at 60 inches, and we're at 636 inches total.

Now, we need to convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches divided by 12 is 53 feet.

"
"Well, that's easy! Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works 8 hours a day. So that's 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes of walking each day. Over 5 days, she walks 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

"Let's figure this out.  If the first place costs $200 plus $5 per person for food, and the second place is $25 per person, we need to find out when those costs are the same.  

So, we can set up an equation: $200 + $5x = $25x

Solving for x (the number of guests), we get:

$200 = $20x

x = 10

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th, starting today, December 31st. That gives him about 200 days.

To lose a pound, you need to burn about 3500 calories more than you take in. So, for 30 pounds, that's 105,000 calories (30 x 3500).

To figure out his daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, so that's $500 * 0.20 = $100 gone.  

That leaves her with $500 - $100 = $400. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs, which is $400 * 0.25 = $100.

So, after buying CDs, Julie has $400 - $100 = $300 left.


$300 

"
"Let's see... the house cost three times as much as the lot, and together they cost $120,000.  That means the lot's price plus three times the lot's price equals $120,000.  

So, four times the lot's price is $120,000.  Dividing both sides by four, we find the lot cost $30,000.  

Since the house cost three times the lot, the house cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"Alright, let's break this down. If one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means it would take them 10 days to paint the whole house.  

Now, with five people working together, you'd divide the work.  Since they're all painting at the same rate, it would take them 10 days / 5 people = 2 days to paint the whole house.

That's 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

"Let's break down the cost:

* The printer cost $400 less than the computer, which was $1100. So the printer cost $1100 - $400 = $700.
* Together, the computer and printer cost $1100 + $700 = $1800.
* That means the two monitors cost $2400 - $1800 = $600.

"Alright, let's break this down. Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he's aiming to double his daily savings in the second half of April.  

Since April has 30 days, that means 15 days in each half. He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half.

To hit that goal, he'd need to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day.

"Alright, let's break down this grilled cheese operation.  

They're spending $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches, which works out to $0.30 per sandwich. Add in the $3.00 per sandwich for cheese and toppings, and their total cost per sandwich is $3.30.

Selling each sandwich for $7.00 means they're making a profit of $3.70 per sandwich.  

For 10 sandwiches, that's a total profit of $37.00.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the total area of the bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each part:

* **Carpet:** 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
* **Installation:** 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

Finally, add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

"
"Well, let's see.  If Mack saw 50 birds on the first two days, none on the third, 120 on days four and five, 20 on day six, and 90 on day seven, we need to add all those up. That's 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Now, to find the average, we divide the total birds by the number of days: 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day.

"
"Let's break this down. If Herb's house is worth $76,000 and Juan's is 30% less, that means Juan's house is worth 70% of Herb's.  

So, Juan's house is worth 0.70 * $76,000 = $53,200.

Adding the two values together, the combined worth of the houses is $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

"Let's break this down. Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That's a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils for Judy.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  In total, her friend brought 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

Together, they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's break this down. Two boxes of contacts will give Pete 180 pairs (90 pairs/box * 2 boxes = 180 pairs). Since each box costs $90.00 after the discount, two boxes cost $180.00.  That means each pair costs $1.00 ($180.00 / 180 pairs = $1.00/pair).

"Let's break down how much each person earned:

* Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 hours total.
* At $10 an hour, Jill earned 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
* John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday (2 hours * 2 = 4 hours) and three times as long on Sunday (1 hour * 3 = 3 hours).
* That means John worked a total of 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours.
* John earned 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Hannah burns 500 calories per hour doing aerobics, so in two hours, she burns 1000 calories.  Running burns 600 calories an hour, so that's another 600 calories. In total, she burns 1600 calories. Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she'll need to drink 800 ml of water.

"Let's break this down.  If there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, and 1% more green than blue, we know the blue jelly beans make up a sort of baseline.  

Think of it like this:

* **Blue:** 100%
* **Red:** 99% of the blue amount
* **Green:** 101% of the blue amount

Since we have a total of 4500 jelly beans, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3 (100% + 99% + 101%), equals 4500.

4500 divided by 3 is 1500. So there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 1485 red jelly beans (99% of 1500) and 1515 green jelly beans (101% of 1500).

The difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break this down. The Dachshund weighs twice the Affenpinscher, so that's 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds. The Papillon is a quarter the weight of the Dachshund, meaning it weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds. Finally, the Mastiff is 44 times heavier than the Papillon, so it weighs 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

"Let's break this down.  We know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  If one angle is *x*, another is 2*x*, and the last is 3*x*, we can set up an equation:

*x* + 2*x* + 3*x* = 180

Combining like terms, we get 6*x* = 180.  Dividing both sides by 6, we find *x* = 30.

The largest angle is 3*x*, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

* In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
* Those sales brought in 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.00.

Adding those together, Patrick made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  If a tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's a lot of rotations!  

We need to find out how many times the tire rotates in a month: 400 miles/month * (725 rotations/2 miles) = 145,000 rotations/month.

Now, if a tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement, we can see how many months it will last: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

Finally, to get the number of years, we divide the total months by 12: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

So, Jeremy should be able to get 6 years out of those tires.

"Let's break down Ariadne's sales:

* She made $800 from green hats since her red hat sales of $400 were half that amount.
* Her total sales for the first month were $800 + $400 = $1200.
* In the second month, she earned $1200 * (3/4) = $900.
* Over two months, her total sales were $1200 + $900 = $2100.

"Alright, let's break down the cost of James's new plane.  

The plane itself cost him $150,000.  Then, he's got $5,000 a month for the hangar and double that, or $10,000, for fuel. That's a total of $15,000 per month to keep that bird in the air. Over a year, that's $180,000.

Adding the initial purchase price, the total cost for the first year comes to $330,000.


$330000 

"
"Let's break down the cooking times:

* Pork took 20 minutes longer than the rice, so that's 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
* Beans took half the time it took to cook both the rice and pork combined, which is (30 minutes + 50 minutes) / 2 = 40 minutes.

Adding up all the cooking times, we get 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's break down the cost of each mixture:

* **Mixture 1:**  (1/2 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $5 + $5 = $10
* **Mixture 2:** (1/5 pound almonds * $10/pound) + (1/3 pound walnuts * $15/pound) = $2 + $5 = $7

The difference in cost is $10 - $7 = $3.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

If 60% of the teachers are history teachers, that means 40% are math teachers.  That's 150 teachers * 0.40 = 60 math teachers.

"Let's break this down. Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Adding up all the cookies, we get 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  If the dress is 140cm long after the extension and lace, and the lace adds 20cm, that means the dress was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long before the lace.

Since the extension was 50% of the original length, the original length was 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.

* The older twin and the younger triplet are like a pair.
* The other twin and the other two triplets are another group.

We need to find a combination of ages that works for both groups and adds up to 44.

After some calculating, I figure one of the twins must be 13 years old.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down the cost:

* The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.
* The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet.
*  Let's say the total bill is ""x"". We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

*  The total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check: x = $40 + 0.60x

*  Solving for x, we get 0.40x = $40, so x = $100.

* John brought $125 and the bill is $100, so he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

* Marta collected triple Tom's amount, giving her 105 points.

Adding up all their points: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

* The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is (3/4) * 12 slices/pizza = 9 slices per pizza.  With two of them, that's 9 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

* In total, they ate 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.

* They started with 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

"
"Let's break this down. Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"Alright, let's break this down. A gallon of milk costs $5, and that's $2 more than a half-gallon. So a half-gallon must cost $3.

Ten gallons of milk would cost 10 * $5 = $50.

Sixteen half-gallons would cost 16 * $3 = $48.

In total, Cecelia spent $50 + $48 = $98.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If 10 students like to bake and 5 like basketball, and 10 like music (that's double the basketball fans!), that's a total of 25 students.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save.

The second amusement park is definitely the better deal.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Park 1:** 2 adults * $26 = $52, plus 2 kids * $12 = $24, for a total of $76.
* **Park 2:** 2 adults * $14 = $28, plus 2 kids * $10 = $20, for a total of $48.

That means they'd save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Let's break this down. Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the number of marbles Sean has, meaning Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  

Together, Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"Well, let's see here.  Candy's got a pretty good business going!  

She rents out 60 chairs a day during the week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs for the weekdays.

On the weekends, she rents out 100 chairs a day, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 chairs.

That means she rents out a total of 300 + 200 = 500 chairs each week.

In a month with 4 weeks, she'd rent out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

And in two months, she'd rent out 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"Alright, let's break this sticker and button problem down. 

Lorraine starts with a good amount of stickers, but she's making some smart trades.  

* First, she trades most of her small stickers for large buttons. That's a good move since large buttons are worth more.
* Then, she trades half her large stickers for even more large buttons.  
* Finally, she trades the rest of her large stickers for a bunch of small buttons.

If you add up all the buttons she gets from each trade, she ends up with a total of 107 buttons.

"Well, let's see. If twice as many people voted for the regulation as against it, we can think of it like this: the ""against"" votes represent one part, and the ""for"" votes represent two parts. That makes a total of three parts.

Since there are 33 council members, each ""part"" represents 33 / 3 = 11 votes.

The regulation was supported by two parts, so there were 11 * 2 = 22 votes in favor.

"Let's figure out how many shirts Krissa needs!

*  She needs 22 small shirts because twice as many students need small as extra-small.
*  She needs 18 medium shirts because that's 4 less than the number of small shirts.
*  She needs 9 large shirts because that's half the number of medium shirts.
*  She needs 15 extra-large shirts because that's 6 more than the number of large shirts.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

If the three houses need a total of 250 cases, and the first house needs half of what the second house needs, we can set up a little equation. Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. That means the first house needs x/2 cases, and the third house needs double the first, or x cases.

So, x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we get 2.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

That means the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, Mike's got 600 movies. A third of those are in series, which is 200 movies.  Since he can get those for a third of the price of a normal movie, that's 200 * ($10 / 3) = $666.67.

That leaves him with 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest, 240 movies, are newer movies at $10 each, so that's 240 * $10 = $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and his really good friend gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and since there are two of them, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade.

"Let's break this down.  Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

Since she fills a 10-ounce jar, we can think of the ingredients as parts of that whole.  If we let the zest be represented by 1 part, then the fragrance is also 1 part. The salt would be 2 parts (twice the zest), the sugar is also 2 parts, and the oil is 4 parts (twice the salt).

That means the total parts are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 parts.

"Hey there!  Paul needs 15 more cupcakes. 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Joe has double the cars Robert has, so he starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars. He sells 20% of those, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 cars.  In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars. That leaves him with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"
"Well, if they raised $175,000 total and $50,000 came from organizations, that means the students raised $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each student raised $6,250.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time on the second day, so that's 8 / 2 = 4 hours.  

That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To get that in minutes, we multiply by 60: 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"
"Let's see... 8 packages of cat food times 11 tins per package is 88 tins.  Then 6 packages of dog food times 6 tins per package is 36 tins.  That means Kimberly bought 88 - 36 = 52 more tins of cat food.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's use some algebra to figure out how many Becca has.

* Let PJ have 'x' cards.
* Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we add up all the cards: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Finally, Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

"
"Let's see... Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink, so that's 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Let's figure out Milly's loss.  

First, the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Then, add the mileage cost: $0.08 per mile times 20 miles equals $1.60. That brings the total shipping to $3.00.

Amazon will give her back 75% of the $32 price, so that's $24.00.

Finally, subtract the refund and shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

Milly will lose $5.00.

"
"Well, let's see here.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high, and Saskay can lift one 12 times higher, that's 12 inches. Kagiyami can lift one 4 times higher than Saskay, so that's 12 * 4 = 48 inches. And finally, Naruto can lift one 10 times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 48 * 10 = 480 inches.  

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"
"Well, that's a simple calculation!  If Mason travels at 8 miles per hour, in 4 hours he'll cover 32 miles (8 x 4 = 32). Then, in another 6 hours, he'll travel another 48 miles (8 x 6 = 48).  

Adding those together, Mason travels a total of 80 miles.

"
"Well, this is a classic distance, rate, and time problem!  

Let's break it down. If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, or 54 hours.  Since the turtles are half as fast, they'd take twice as long as a kangaroo. So, four turtles would take 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours.

But wait! We have four turtles, and they're all working together. That means their speeds add up.  Since each turtle is 1/108th the speed of a kangaroo, four turtles together would be 4 * (1/108) = 1/27th the speed of a kangaroo.

That means it would take them 27 hours to cross the highway.

Let's figure this out. If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, and we need to find the total unused length, we need to find out how much is left of each stick and add it up.

* Stick 1: 12 mm * (5/6) = 10 mm
* Stick 2: 12 mm * (1/3) = 4 mm
* Stick 3: 12 mm * (1/2) = 6 mm

Adding those up: 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

"Well, let's see... Claire gets a badge every month, and Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one every two months. That means in a year, Amber gets 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges. Wendy gets three times as many as Claire, so she earns 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month, or 36 badges in a year.  

That means Wendy earns 36 badges - 6 badges = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Let's break this down.  If we call the number of books Fawn has ""F"", we know a few things:

* Anne has F - 12 books.
* Sofie has F + 13 books.

All together, they have 85 books, so:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Jo needs 0.5 yards of material per small mask and she's making 20 of those, so that's 10 yards right there. For the large masks, she needs 0.75 yards per mask and she's making 8, so that's another 6 yards.  

In total, she'll need 16 yards of material.

"
"Let's see... Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He uses 3 blue ones and a third of his red ones, which is 9 / 3 = 3 red boxes.  That means he has 7 - 3 = 4 blue boxes left and 9 - 3 = 6 red boxes left.  

In total, Tim has 4 + 6 = 10 shoeboxes left.

"
"Hey there!  Joseph has 16 books left. 

Here's how I figured it out:

* Sarah has 9 books, and Joseph had twice that many, so he started with 9 * 2 = 18 books.
* He lost 2 books, so he has 18 - 2 = 16 books now.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (that's 30 divided by 5) and then another 10 to Donald.  That means he gave away a total of 16 marbles.  If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left.

"
"Let's break this down. Duncan is 60 now, so eight years ago he was 52.  We know that eight years ago, Duncan was twice Adam's age four years ago. This means Adam was 52 / 2 = 26 four years ago.  

That makes Adam 30 now (26 + 4). In eight years, Adam will be 38 (30 + 8).

"
"Well, let's see here. Twice Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres * 2 = 400 acres.  Farmer Smith has 100 more than that, so his farm is 400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres.  Together they have 200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres. 

700 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Colby makes $0.20 per package and completes 40 packages an hour (50 - 10 = 40).  That means he earns $8.00 per hour (40 * $0.20 = $8.00). Over an 8-hour day, he'd make $64.00 ( $8.00/hour * 8 hours = $64.00).

"
"Let's break this down. Benny used 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon and he had 20 red balloons, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna.  That leaves 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna for the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, there must be 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"
"Let's break down Bruce's work hours:

* Wednesday: He works twice as long as Tuesday, so that's 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours.
* Thursday: He works 2 hours less than Wednesday, meaning he works 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours.

Adding up all the hours: 5 hours + 10 hours + 8 hours = 23 hours.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's see... 30 students selling 10 lollipops each means they sold a total of 300 lollipops.  If they sold each lollipop for $0.80 and it cost them $0.50 to buy each one, they made a profit of $0.30 per lollipop.

So, their total profit is 300 lollipops * $0.30/lollipop = $90.

"
"Let's see... Larry has a lot of furry friends!  He has 9 dogs because he has three times as many dogs as his 3 cats.  Then he has 7 rabbits because he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.  His fish tank has 21 fish because that's three times the number of rabbits. And finally, he has 7 gerbils, which is one-third the number of fish.

Adding them all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets!

"Hey there!  Let's figure out those calories.

A mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories (600 / 3) and a mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories (450 / 3).

That means the cinnamon rolls have a total of 40,000 calories (200 rolls * 200 calories/roll) and the muffins have 45,000 calories (300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin).

Adding those together, Andrew's pastries have a grand total of 85,000 calories.

"Well, let's see here.  Rita's got a Junebug problem!  

* Tuesday and Wednesday she got twice the amount from Monday, so that's 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day.
* That's 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days.
* All together, she got 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.
*  To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  They've got a lot of stuff!  

They need a table for every two boxes, so with 60 boxes, they'll need 30 tables total. Since they already have 15, they'll need to find 15 more.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Zoey spits 40 seeds at 10 feet each, so that's 40 * 10 = 400 feet. Sydney spits 35 seeds at 12 feet each, for a total of 35 * 12 = 420 feet.  

Adding those together, they spit a combined 400 + 420 = 820 feet.  

To find the average, we divide the total distance by the number of people: 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The Widgeteer 3000 churns out widgets at a rate of 60 per hour, while the WidgetMaster 9000 manages 45.  

Running 24/7 for a month (30 days), the Widgeteer 3000 will produce 1440 widgets a day, totaling 43,200 widgets for the month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 1080 widgets a day, for a monthly total of 32,400.

Since each widget sells for $6, the Widgeteer 3000 will bring in $259,200, while the WidgetMaster 9000 will earn $194,400.

That means Fern will make $64,800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

"
"Well, let's see here.  Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, and those sheep are a bit more demanding, needing 7 pounds each.  That means for all the goats, we're looking at 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.  For the sheep, it's 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.  Adding those together, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's break down John's spending:

* He earns 300 dollars (50 dollars/hour * 6 hours).
* After gas and pencils, he has 200 dollars (300 dollars - 50 dollars - 50 dollars).
* After putting money in the bank, he has 100 dollars left (200 dollars - 100 dollars).

That means John can buy 4 pens (100 dollars / 25 dollars/pen).

"
"Let's see... Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so that's 20 * 15 = 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters, meaning he spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters worth of words.  

Together, they spelled 300 + 350 = 650 letters.

"Let's figure this out.  If Bahati scored the most, and scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra to solve for Azibo's points.

Let Azibo's points be represented by ""x"".

* Bahati: x + 20
* Dinar: x + 10

Together they scored 45 points: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5



Azibo scored 5 points.

"Ahoy, matey!  Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 more the third. That's 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes. But they filled in two, so there were 29 holes left. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first, so they must have dug 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes on the first day.  Since ye can't dig a quarter of a hole, I reckon the map was a bit off.  

Anyway, they had 29 holes at the start of the fourth day and 7 at the end of the first, so they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

Since each plant needs 30 inches (12 inches wide plus 18 inches of space), we divide the total length of the bed (1332 inches) by 30 inches per plant. That gives us 44.4 plants. Since Pat can't buy parts of plants, she'll need to buy 45 plants in total.

She already has 17, so she needs to buy 28 more. At $6 a pop, that'll cost her $168.

"Hey there! My name is Alexander.  Let's see... Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 a day. So the brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  In a week, that's 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.

"Let's break down the cost:

* Each basket needs 3 petunias at $3.00 each, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00 per basket.
* Each basket also needs 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, for a total of 2 * $2.50 = $5.00 per basket.
* That means each basket costs $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00 to fill.
* Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost will be $14.00/basket * 5 baskets = $70.00.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Peeling 90 shrimp will take Emily 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.

Cooking them in batches will take 30 minutes since she can only cook 30 at a time.

"Well, let's see. Buford pays his electric and gas bills once a month, so that's 12 checks each for those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And the pest and lawn service gets paid every three months, which is 4 checks a year.  

Adding those all up, Buford writes 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks a year.

"Let's break this down.  The first plane is busy! It flies to Greece most of the time, and the rest of its flights are split between France and Germany.  Since the second plane only flies to Poland, and it makes half as many trips as the first plane, we know the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.  

If 66 of those trips are to Greece, that leaves 88 - 66 = 22 trips for France and Germany.  

So, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

"Hey there!  

So, the Smiths need to figure out how much it'll cost to fill their pool.  First, we gotta find out how many gallons it holds.  Since it's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we multiply those together: 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet.

Now, they told me to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons. So, 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Finally, at $0.10 per gallon, the total cost will be 8260 x $0.10 = $826.00.

$826.00

"Alright, let's figure this out. 

Wanda and Ms. B are working hard! On the first day, Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so that's 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps in one-third of her day one amount, which is 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

Adding up all the water pumped, we get 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

That means they still need to pump in 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break this down.  If Teresa sells a large stuffed animal for three times the price of a small one, and small ones cost $4, then large ones cost $12.

She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and her earnings from small stuffed animals would be 8x.

In total, she made $120, so 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

Let's see... 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, eh? Those lads are efficient. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 50% more than with an iron one, which doubles the output of bare hands. So, that's 12 pounds * 2 * 1.50 = 36 pounds per day for each dwarf.

Over a month of 30 days, that's 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds per dwarf.

The first set was 4 more than the second, so that's x + 4.

Adding those all up: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

"
"Let's break this down. If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their combined time is 98 minutes, we can figure out how long each person cooked.

Let's say Donovan cooked for 'x' minutes. Betsy cooked for 'x + 18' minutes.

Together, that's x + (x + 18) = 98 minutes.

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 40.

So, Donovan cooked for 40 minutes.

Betsy cooked for 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Well, let's see here.  A cast is $200, the doctor charges $300 an hour and she was there for 30 minutes, so that's $150.  The painkillers are $4 each and she got 30, so that's $120. And parking is $6 an hour for two hours, so that's $12.  Adding it all up, the total cost is $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

He needs 6 dozen croissants, which means he'll need 6 pounds of butter.  Since the deal is buy one get one half off, he'll pay full price for 3 pounds and get the other 3 half off.

That's 3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00 for the full-price butter.

The discounted butter is 3 pounds * $4.00/pound * 0.50 = $6.00

So, the total cost is $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

"Let's figure out the cost of Kayla's party!

First, we need to know how many extra guests are coming beyond the initial 20 included in the rental fee.  Kayla invited 45 people, and 4 can't make it, so that's 45 - 4 = 41 guests attending.

That means there are 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests.

Each extra guest costs $6, so that's 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the base rental fee: $125 + $126 = $251.

"
"Let's break this down. Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. He then sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

"
"Well, let's see.  If James walks 4 miles per hour and the store is 4 miles away, it would normally take him 1 hour to get there. But he has to walk back home from the halfway point, which adds extra time.  

So, it takes him 0.5 hours to reach the halfway point, then another 0.5 hours to walk back home. That's a total of 1 hour just to get back to where he started. Then he has to walk another hour to the store.

In total, it takes James 1.5 hours to reach the store.

"
"Well, let's see.  If Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas per bunch, that's 40 bananas in total.

Buying them individually would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But since she buys them in bunches, it's only 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

So, she saves $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"
"Let's break this down. If Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can think of it like this:

*  Sam's fence + 60 feet = Harry's fence

Since they have 100 feet total, we can set up an equation:

* Sam's fence + Harry's fence = 100 feet

Let's use ""x"" to represent how much fence Sam gets.  

* x + (x + 60) = 100

Now we can solve for x:

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Alright, let's break this down. The ball starts at 72 feet (3 floors * 24 feet/floor). After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that, which is 48 feet. Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet.  

That means the ball reaches **32 feet** on its second bounce. 



"
"Let's break it down:

* The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, who is 6 feet tall (that's 6 * 12 = 72 inches). So the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
* The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
* Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

The faster train covers 180 miles in three hours (60 miles/hour * 3 hours), and the slower train covers 90 miles (30 miles/hour * 3 hours).

Adding those distances together, we find the trains are 270 miles apart after three hours.

She covers 2 miles in 40 minutes, which means she's walking at 3 miles per hour on the beach.

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her sidewalk speed is 6 miles per hour.  That means it takes her 10 minutes to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk (1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour, which is 10 minutes).

Adding up the time on the beach and the sidewalk, her total walk time is 50 minutes.

* In total, that's 700 animals (470 + 230).

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

So, Russell's getting 4 packs of bagels at $10 a pop, which is $40 total. But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $4 off, bringing his total to $36.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, he's got 36 bagels in total (4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels).

To find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women. If there are 84 passengers total, that represents 14 parts (5 + 9).  

Each ""part"" is worth 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

Initially, there were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left on the bus.

"Well, let's see.  He makes $26 a day from single sunflowers and $56 a day from bouquets. If each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $56 / 12 = $4.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, each sunflower, whether sold alone or in a bouquet, brings in $2 + $4.67 = $6.67. Over three days, that's $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01 per sunflower.

Since he made $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days, he must have sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

You can't sell parts of sunflowers, so Faraday sold 12 sunflowers after three days.

So, Hortex needs to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 2300 people. That's a lot of juice!  

They're currently making enough to cover 20% of that need per person, which means they're only hitting 20% of the total energy requirement for those 2300 people.

To get to 100%, we need to figure out how much more energy is needed and then how many bottles that translates to.

They need to produce 7300 more bottles to meet the demand.

That means he's collecting from a total of 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

He hits each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, we can figure out the length of the red rope.

Here's how I'd solve it:

* **Think about the relationships:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope
   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

* **Use the total length:**

   * Red rope + Blue rope + Yellow rope = 37

* **Substitute to solve:** Since we want to find the red rope's length, let's use the relationships to express everything in terms of one of the ropes. I'll use the yellow rope.

   * Red rope = 4 * (Yellow rope - 7)
   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7

* **Now substitute into the total length equation:**

   * (4 * (Yellow rope - 7)) + (Yellow rope - 7) + Yellow rope = 37

* **Simplify and solve for the yellow rope:**

   * 4 * Yellow rope - 28 + Yellow rope - 7 + Yellow rope = 37
   * 6 * Yellow rope - 35 = 37
   * 6 * Yellow rope = 72
   * Yellow rope = 12

* **Find the blue rope:**

   * Blue rope = Yellow rope - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

* **Finally, find the red rope:**

   * Red rope = 4 * Blue rope = 4 * 5 = 20

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Wendy's age is related to Colin's age both now and in the future.  

Let's use ""w"" for Wendy's current age and ""c"" for Colin's current age.

* We're told Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. That means: w = 5(c + 7)

* We're also told that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This translates to: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

From the first equation, we can see that w = 5c + 35.

Let's plug that value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3

75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

40/3 = (2/3)c

c = (40/3) * (3/2)

c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

* **High:** (1 liter/day * 2 * 2) * 5 days = 20 liters

Adding those up, the dehumidifier removed a total of 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters of water.

"Hey there!  

Let's see... they had 10 packs of balloons with 30 in each pack, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.  If they had 12 left over, they must have thrown 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

"Let's break this down.  

Saanvi needs three times as much of the second medicine as the first, so that's 14 mL * 3 = 42 mL.

In total, each dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

For eight doses, she'd need 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.

"Let's break this down.  John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's class, which holds 120 students. That means each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, they have a combined capacity of 15 * 2 = 30 students.

Adding that to Ali's class size, the total capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

So Stephen owes $300 plus 2%, which is $6. That brings the total to $306.

He pays $25 a month for 11 months, so that's $25 * 11 = $275.

That means he still owes $306 - $275 = $31 in the twelfth month.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we need to figure out how many jelly beans this jar can hold. It's a pretty standard jar, 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. That gives us a volume of 540 cubic inches.

Now, jelly beans don't pack perfectly, so we gotta account for that.  Let's say we get about 80% efficiency. That means we're looking at about 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.

Each jelly bean is about 0.15 cubic inches, so we can fit roughly 2880 jelly beans in there.

If 30% of those are red, that's about 864 red jelly beans.

Looks like Tim was a bit off.  He missed the mark by 36 jelly beans. 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

The bus starts with 20 people, then picks up 40 more, and then another 30 (which is three-quarters of the first group). That's 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

Then, at the third stop, the number doubles to 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

"Let's break down Pauline's museum expenses.

* She visits 3 times a year at $2 a visit, so that's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.
* Over 5 years, she spends $6 * 5 = $30.
* The price jumps up by 150%, meaning a $2 ticket becomes $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $5.
* For the next 3 years, she spends $5 * 3 * 3 = $45.
* In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"
"Okay, so they have 4 grades, and each grade sends 10 students. That means 40 students total want to try the escape room.  But the room only fits 8 at a time. So, they'll need 40 / 8 = 5 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes for everyone to go.

"
"Let's break this down.  If the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being divided into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Since the whole board is 40 feet long, each of these parts is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of these parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

"Let's break this down. Carly needs enough treats for 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats, so that's a total of 10 treats.  She makes fewer cupcakes than brownies.  If we think about it, the only way to make this work is if she makes a smaller number of cupcakes and then a larger number of brownies.

Let's try starting with 3 cupcakes. That leaves 7 treats to be brownies.  If she makes 3 times the number of cupcakes in brownies, that would be 9 brownies. That's too many!

So, Carly must have made **3** cupcakes. 



"
"Hey there!  

Let's see... a manicure and pedicure combo usually runs $75, but with the 20% discount, that brings it down to $60.  Adding nail art at $3 per nail for all ten fingers would be another $30.

"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes used already.  

Since their mom used 12 grapes per pie for 4 pies, she used 12 * 4 = 48 grapes.

Adding those together, they started with 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Rose spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozen eggs, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.

She's selling them in groups of three for $1.00 a pop. With 60 eggs (5 dozen * 12 eggs/dozen), she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets.

That means she'll bring in 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Her profit is the difference: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.

"
"Let's break this down. If Mary made 116 ice cubes total, and the blueberry cubes are 5 times the strawberry cubes minus 4, we can set up an equation. Let 'x' be the number of strawberry cubes.

So, blueberry cubes would be 5x - 4.

The total is x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get 6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides, we have 6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find x = 20.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes: 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much water Crista needs.

* She's got 4 plants that need half a cup each, so that's 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
* Then there are 8 plants that need a full cup, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
* The rest of her plants, 8 of them, need a quarter cup each, which is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"
"Well, let's see here. Phineas has a 200-yard journey, half on land and half in water.  That means he'll hop 100 yards and swim 100 yards.

Since he hops at 20 yards a minute, that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming at 10 yards a minute, the watery part will take 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those together, it'll take Phineas 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

The T-shirts are a bit tricky. Since he gets one half off, he pays full price for one ($8) and half price for the other ($8 / 2 = $4). That means the T-shirts cost him $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are easier. Forty percent off $40 is $40 * 0.40 = $16. So the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding the T-shirts and shoes, Jake spent $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Let's see... Ryan earned $6 a week for three weeks, so that's $6 * 3 = $18.  Those ice cream cones cost $1.25 each, and he bought four of them, so that's $1.25 * 4 = $5.  That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Let's add up their spending:

* Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a frame, for a total of $105.
* Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $200 on bathrobes ($100 each), for a total of $230.

Together, they spent $105 + $230 = $335.

"Alright, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business. 

Each jar costs $44 to make ($12 for passion fruit, $12 for jackfruit, and $20 for honey). He sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of $6 per jar.

Selling 10 jars would net him a profit of $60.

"Let's see... 32 quarters is $8.00, 95 dimes is $9.50, 120 nickels is $6.00, and 750 pennies is $7.50.  Adding those all up, Justin has $31.00 in his jar.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15.00 on movie tickets (since she bought two at $7.50 each), and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $13.00 left.

"
"Well, let's see here.  If Josh services 3 cars a day and he's closed on Sunday and Wednesday, that means he works 5 days a week. So he services 15 cars each week (3 cars/day * 5 days/week).

At $4 a car, he makes $60 a week. Over two weeks, that's $120.

"
"Let's see... Randy starts with 18 cookies. He eats 3, then 2 more, leaving him with 13.  He gives away 2, so he has 11. Then he bakes 12 more, for a total of 23 cookies.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... half of 12 toys is 6.  So he'd make $30 from the first half and $42 from the second half.  That means he'd earn a total of $72.

"
"Well, let's see. The dog dug a whole lot of holes while Nate was gone!  It'll take some time to fill them all back in.  

If the dog digs 6 holes a day and Nate fills 9, that means he's making progress by 3 holes each day. Since the dog dug 84 holes, it will take Nate 28 days to fill them all in. That's 4 weeks.

"Hey there!  

Butler High School has 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School, which means they have 3000 students. That's 1000 fewer students than Norman High School.

"
"Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"
"Let's see... Igor brought 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and we know he had 29 items total.  That means he must have brought 29 - 8 - 16 = 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7, he must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

"
"Let's see... 4 tables times 4 legs per table is 16 legs.  Then 16 legs times 2 screws per leg is 32 screws.  He'll have 8 screws left over.

"Well, if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, the second basket must have 20 eggs.  That means together they have 30 eggs.

"Kim raised a lot! She got $750, which is $320 more than me. I raised $430. Maryam did really well too, getting $700, which is $400 more than Sarah's $300.  

Let's add it all up: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

We raised $2180 in total!

"Let's break this down. Aaron is speedy, running twice as fast as Vanessa.  That means if Vanessa takes 8 minutes to run a mile, Aaron takes 4 minutes. Since Aaron ran his part in 16 minutes, covering 4 miles, Vanessa must have taken twice as long for each mile, meaning she took 32 minutes total.

"
"Well, let's see. He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total.  Since he already has 6 feet, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"
"Well, let's see. Six reservations a night, two meals per reservation at five bucks a pop, plus a five dollar bottle of wine... that's fifteen bucks per reservation.  So, they're making ninety dollars a night.  Two nights a week, that's one hundred eighty dollars.

"
"Well, let's see. A 25% profit on $80 worth of watermelons means he made an extra $20.  That means he sold all 50 watermelons for $100.  So each watermelon would have to be sold for $2.

"
"Let's break this down. Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9. James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's now 37. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the youngest son is 5. In three years, he'll be 8.

"
"Well, let's see. Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes per orange.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  

Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Jane can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there!  Sounds like Mark got a great deal on that radiator.  

Let's see, 80% off $400 is $320 in savings. That means the radiator only cost him $80.  

Adding in the $150 for the mechanic, his total cost was $230.

"
"Well, this is a classic!  Let's see... 20 animals with 70 legs.  Since chickens have two legs and cows have four, we can figure this out.  

If all the animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2). That leaves us 30 extra legs (70 - 40).  

Each cow has two extra legs compared to a chicken, so those 30 extra legs must belong to 15 cows (30 / 2).

That means there are 5 chickens (20 - 15).

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  If they have 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, that's a total of 56 slices (7 x 8 = 56). With Henry and his 3 friends, there are 4 people eating.  So, each person gets 14 slices (56 / 4 = 14).
