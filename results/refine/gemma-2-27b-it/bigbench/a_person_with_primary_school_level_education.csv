There are four houses, and we need to find the one with tulips.

We know the flutist lives in the second house. And the tulips are right next to the guitarist.

The lilies are next to the carnations, but on the left side.

Hmm... if the flutist is in the middle, the pianist must be in one of the houses next to them.

Answer: (C) 1
"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the green lover is in the first house and they like kiwis.  

The person who likes blue is next to the one with the gameboy. And the cellist is one house away from the gameboy person.

There are three houses, and everyone likes different things.  

We know the soccer player lives before the person eating oranges, and the daffodil person lives after the oranges.  That means it goes: Soccer Player - Oranges - Daffodils.

The swimmer lives next to the daffodils, so it's: Soccer Player - Oranges - Swimmer - Daffodils.

And the tulips are after the mangos.  So the whole thing is: Mangos - Tulips - Soccer Player - Oranges - Swimmer - Daffodils.

The daffodils are in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and we need to find out which one has tulips.

"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.

One wears sandals, one wears boots. One likes mystery books, one likes history books. One drives a car that goes down, one drives a big truck!

The clue says the car that goes down is next to the history book person. So the car that goes down is in house number 1, and the history book person is in house number 2.

The other clue says the boots person isn't in house number 1. So they must be in house number 2.

That means the sandals person is in house number 1!

The fish person isn't in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

That means the cat person has to be in house 1!


Answer: (A) 1 

"
"Okay, this puzzle is like a big matching game!  

We gotta figure out who lives in which house and what they like.  

Let's see... the dog owner is in house number 2. And the person who likes red lives right next to them, so they must be in house number 3.

Answer: (A) 2 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and everyone in them is different! One wears sandals, one wears boots, and one wears loafers. They all like different colors too - blue, green, and yellow. And they're eating different fruits: apples, grapes, and mangos.

They also had different lunches: grilled cheese, pizza, or fried rice. And they each have a different thing: a computer, a phone, or a radio.

* The basketball player isn't in house number 1.
* The fish person is after the dog person.
* The bird keeper isn't in house number 1 or 3.
* The tennis player is right next to the cat person.

Hmm... let me think...

If the basketball player is before the swimmer, and the basketball player isn't in house 1, then the basketball player must be in house 3, and the swimmer is in house 4!

The tennis player and cat person are together, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.

The fish person is after the dog person, so the dog person must be in house 1 and the fish person in house 2.

That leaves house 4 for the bird keeper!


So the answer is (C) 4.

The boots person is next to the yellow person, so they must be in the first house.

That means the green person must be in the first house too!

"
"This puzzle is tricky!  It's like a big matching game.  

You gotta look for clues that tell you who lives where. Like, clue number 4 says the radio is in the fourth house. That's a good start!

One eats grapes, one eats mangos. One drives a cool convertible, one drives a minivan. One plays cricket, one plays baseball.

We know the baseball player is in house number two, and they also drive the convertible!  That means the person in house number two likes baseball and has a convertible.

The grapes person can't be in house number one, so they must be in house number two too.

That means the mango person has to be in house number one!

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the blue person is in the middle house. And the kiwi person is in the last house because the blue person is before them.

The apple person is right next to the orange person, so they must be in the first and second houses.

The white person is to the right of the green person.  So the green person can't be last.

That means the white person must be in the last house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One is number 1 and the other is number 2.  

We know some stuff about the people who live there:

* They play different sports, one plays soccer and one swims.
* They have different things, one has a phone and one has a gameboy.

The clues tell us:

1. The root beer person lives to the right of the roses.
2. The soccer player lives right next to the mystery book reader.
3. The gameboy person lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

Hmmm... so the roses have to be in house number 1 because the root beer person is to their right.

So the answer is (A) 1! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses in a row, and each one has a person with a different pet and car. We need to figure out where the dog owner lives.

* The truck person lives right next to the sedan person.
* The truck person is right next to the sedan person.
* The fish person is right next to the dog person.
* The cat person doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... let me draw some houses:

[House 1] [House 2] [House 3] [House 4]

Okay, so the truck and sedan are together, and the fish and dog are together.  The minivan is on the end.

Let's try putting them in:

[Truck] [Sedan] [Fish] [Dog] [Minivan]

Oh! The cat person has to go in the first house because they can't be in the second.

So the dog person lives in house number **3**. 


The answer is (C).
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, and each person likes a different color and drink.

We know the root beer lover is in the second house, and the yellow lover is in the third house.  The blue lover has to be to the right of the yellow lover, so they must be in the fourth house!

"Okay, let's see...

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"Okay, let's see...

So the phone must be in the last house, and the lilies are in the second to last house!

House 2: Computer
House 3: Tulips
House 4: Lilies
House 5: Phone

* Clue 4 says the daffodils are to the right of the radio.

1. Tea | 2. Pizza | 3. | 4.

The milk drinker is before the spaghetti eater, and the spaghetti eater is before the water drinker.

1. Tea | 2. Pizza | 3. Spaghetti | 4. Water

The white lover is next to the water drinker, so white is in house 3.

1. Tea | 2. Pizza | 3. Spaghetti White | 4. Water

The coffee drinker is before the yellow lover.  

1. Tea Coffee | 2. Pizza Yellow | 3. Spaghetti White | 4. Water

* Yellow and green houses are next to each other.
* The fantasy book person lives to the right of the stew eater.
* The grilled cheese eater doesn't live in the middle house.
* The stew eater is right next to the romance book lover.

Hmmm... so green is in the last house, and yellow is next to it, so yellow must be in the middle house!

That means stew must be in the first house, because the fantasy book person is to the right of the stew eater.

So, the romance book lover is in the middle house with yellow.

"
"The lilies have to be in house number 2!  

Here's why:

* The person with the sedan is somewhere before the person with the lilies.

There are three houses, and everyone in them is different! One wears boots, one wears running shoes, and one wears high heels. They all ate different things for lunch too - grilled cheese, pizza, or fried rice. And they all have different cars and play different sports!

Hmm... let's see what the clues tell us:

* The minivan is in the last house.
* The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's see... it says there's a house between the horses and the daffodils. And the saxophone player lives right next to the person who likes science fiction books.  

Hmm, this is tricky! I'm gonna need to draw a picture to keep track of everything.

(The persona would likely start drawing a simple grid or list to help them visualize the information.) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the tulips!

There are lots of clues, but let's see...

* The dog person is in house number 2.
* The fishy person is in house number 3.
* The tulips are next to the carnations, and they're also next to the convertible car.

Hmm... that means the tulips can't be in house number 1 or 5.

Let's see... the truck is next to the computer, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible.

So it has to be like this:

Truck - Computer - Tulips - Convertible

That means the tulips are in house number **4**! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and we need to find out where the dog owner lives.  

We know the basketball player and the saxophonist live in the first house.

The pizza eater is right next to the dog owner.

Hmmm... let me think...

The answer must be **(B) 3**! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are two houses, right? One has a cat person and the other likes fish. One has a computer and one has a radio. One likes romance books and one likes history books. One has lilies and one has daffodils. And one wears high heels and one wears loafers!

Hmm...

The history book person is in the first house. And the cat person can't be in the second house.  The high heels are in the first house, and the daffodils are in the second.

So, the lilies must be in the first house!

(B) 1 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza!  

There are five houses, and each one has a person with different stuff.  Like, one has roses, one has a guitar, and one ate apples.

We have lots of clues, like the apple eater is in house number 3, and the person who ate fried rice is next to them.

We gotta use all the clues to figure out who ate pizza. It's like a puzzle!

Hmmm... this is tricky. I need to look at all the clues carefully.

(After carefully examining the clues, I would try to fill in the grid as best as I can, using simple logic and elimination.)

Let me see...  

(After some more time, I would hopefully arrive at the answer and choose the correct option.) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cellist lives.  

There are four houses, and each one has a person with a different favorite color, instrument, flower, lunch, and book. We have lots of clues!

Let's see... the history book person is in house number 2, and the fantasy book person is in house number 4.  

The person who likes yellow lives next to the person with the roses. And the blue person is somewhere before the green person, with two houses in between.

Oh, and the pizza person is before the fried rice person, and the daffodils are before the fried rice too.

Hmmm... this is tricky!  

Let me see... I think the cellist lives in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person likes different things.  

We know the pianist and the kiwi eater live next to each other. And the flutist is on the right side of the violinist.

Hmm... the grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater.

I think the pianist must live in house number 2! 

(B)
"
"The kiwi person is in house number 1. The fantasy book person can't be in house number 1, so they must be in house number 2!

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"The person who likes red lives in house number **(D) 3**. 

I know this because the clues tell us so!  



"
"The root beer lover lives in house number 1! 

Here's why:

* We know the root beer lover doesn't live in house number 2.
* The piano player lives next to the cello player, so they must be in house 1 and 2. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone has different shoes and flowers.  We need to figure out where the lilies are.

Hmm, some clues say the tulips are next to the loafers, and the daffodils are before the tulips.  And the boots are next to the carnations, and the carnations are in the last house!

Let me try drawing it out...

* House 1:  Maybe daffodils?
* House 2:  Maybe running shoes?
* House 3:  Maybe tulips?
* House 4:  Boots!
* House 5: Carnations!

That means the lilies must be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are four houses and lots of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Hmm, I think we need to figure out where each person lives one by one.  It's like a detective game!

I'm gonna need to look at all the clues carefully and see if I can find any that tell me exactly where someone lives.  

(I'll need a bit more time to figure this out!) 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person in the houses likes different things and eats different food. We need to figure out who ate fried rice.

* We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* The person with high heels doesn't live in the last house.
* Spaghetti isn't in the second house, and stew isn't in the second house either.
* The boots are next to the high heels, and the boots are before the stew.

Hmmm... so the boots are in the first house, and the high heels are in the second house. That means the stew must be in the last house!

Since spaghetti isn't in the second house, the fried rice must be there!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, and each one has a different flower and a person who likes a different kind of book.

We know the rose bouquet is in the second house.  And the person who likes science fiction books lives next to the rose bouquet. So, the science fiction person must be in house one!

The person who likes romance books is next to the tulips, and the tulips are in the last house. So, the romance person is in the third house.

The carnations are somewhere before the romance books, so they must be in the second house.

That means the lilies have to be in the last house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"The science fiction person lives in house number 1.  The coffee drinker is in house number 1 too because they live to the left of the sandal wearer. That means the romance book lover must be in house number 2!

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"The percussionist is in house number 1 because they are next to the person with the radio.  That means the person with the phone must be in house number 1 too!

Answer: (A) 1 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the car person in the middle house drives a cool convertible!

The person who likes yellow lives right next to the person with the sedan. And the white lover and the sedan person live in houses that are one house apart.

Hmmm... that means the yellow person must live in the first house! 


(A) 1
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone has different stuff!  

We know the person in the first house wears running shoes. And the third house has a sedan.

The clues tell us where some things are, like the bird keeper is near the running shoes, and the fish person is near the SUV.

Hmmm... it's like a puzzle! We gotta figure out where everyone lives and what they have.

Let me think...

*Looks at the clues carefully*

...

I think the horse person lives in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the truck driver lives.  There are clues about flowers, cars, food, pets, and shoes.  

Hmm, it's gonna take some thinking! I'm gonna try drawing little pictures for each house and write down the clues. Maybe if I see it all laid out, it'll make more sense.

*Looks around for paper and crayons*

Okay, I'm ready to start figuring this out! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person likes different food and books.

We know the fried rice person lives in the middle house, and they like fantasy books. The spaghetti person lives in the first house, and the science fiction person is also in the first house.

That means the grilled cheese person must live in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"The person with the carnations lives in house number 1 because they live to the left of the person with the dog.  

(B) 1 

"
"Okay, so we know the kiwi eater is in house number 2.  And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  That means the high heel wearer must be in house number 2 too!

So the answer is (B) 2. üë†
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are two houses, right? One person in each house.  They have different stuff.

We know:

* One has a TV, one has a phone.
* One wears sandals, one wears high heels.
* One likes tea, one likes water.
* One eats kiwis, one eats grapes.

The clues tell us:

* High heels are before sandals.
* Grapes and sandals are next to each other.
* The tea drinker is before the TV person.

Hmmm... so it has to be like this:

* House 1: High heels, Grapes
* House 2: Sandals, TV

That means the kiwi eater must be in House 1!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.  And the violinist can't be in the last house.  

The water drinker has to be to the right of the cellist.  

Hmmm... if the violinist isn't last, and there has to be a house between the violinist and the guitarist, then the guitarist must be in the last house!


So the answer is (C) 3. 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the person with sandals lives in the third house, and they also like milk!  The person who drinks water lives right next to them, so they must be in house number 4.

So the answer is (B) 4. 



"
"Okay, so we have five houses in a row, and each one has a person with a different thing and they ate different food.  

We gotta figure out who ate spaghetti!

Let's see... the pizza guy is in house number 4. And the computer person isn't in house 4, and neither is the radio person.

Hmm, the grilled cheese person is right next to the spaghetti person. And the radio person is one house away from the grilled cheese person.

Oh! The gameboy person and the computer person live next to each other, and the fried rice person is one house away from the gameboy person.

I think... I think the spaghetti person is in house number 3!


**(E)** 

"
"This puzzle is like a big matching game!  We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to look at all the clues, but we can do it!  

Let me see... hmm... lots of numbers and words!

(After carefully studying the clues)

Okay, I think the person eating the banana lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are two houses, right? One person in each house. One likes to play drums, and the other plays guitar. One ate pizza, and one ate grilled cheese. One has a dog, and one has a bird.

Hmm... the grilled cheese person lives to the right of the bird person. And the drummer doesn't live in the second house.

That means the drummer must live in the first house!  If the drummer is in the first house, the guitar player is in the second house.

And since the grilled cheese person is to the right of the bird person, the bird person must be in the first house and the grilled cheese person in the second.

So, the pizza person must be in the first house!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3!  The puzzle says so right there in clue number 2. üê¶üè†  



"
"Okay, let's see...

Hmm, lots of clues!  Let's see... the cat lover is in the first house. And some people can't be in the second house.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta think about who likes what and where they are.

I'm gonna try drawing a picture to help me remember.

...

(After some scribbling and muttering)

Okay, I think I got it!  The science fiction book fanatic lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, and each person likes a different color and eats a different fruit.

We know the grape person is in the second house.  

The red person has to be to the right of the kiwi person. Green and red live next to each other, and green is to the left of yellow. White is one house away from red.

Hmmm... that means the kiwi person must be in the first house! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"The stew person has to live in house number 1.  

Here's why:

The person with running shoes lives to the right of the orange eater.  The mystery book reader lives next to the stew eater.  If the stew eater lived in house number 2, there wouldn't be room for the running shoes person!


Answer: (B) 1 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the person who drinks water lives in the middle house. And the root beer lover is in the first house.  The person with the daffodils is right next to the person with the phone.  The TV is on the right side of the tulips.

Hmmm... that means the milk drinker must be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and everyone in them is different! One wears loafers, one wears running shoes, and one wears boots.  One likes water, one likes tea, and one likes milk. One eats kiwis, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos. And one has a gameboy, one has a computer, and one has a phone.

We have to figure out who has the computer!

Hmm... let me think about the clues...

(Thinking really hard...)

Okay, I think the answer is (C) 2! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We need to find out which house has the horses.

* We know the golfer doesn't live in the last house.
* And the person with the fish lives somewhere before the person with the horses.
* The golfer and baseball player live next to each other.
* The flowers help too! The roses are before the daffodils.

Hmm... let me try drawing it out:

House 1   House 2   House 3
       Golfer?   Baseball?

* Oh! The person with the carnations is next to the person with the horses.

Let's put that in:

House 1   House 2   House 3
       Golfer?   Carnations & Horses?

* And the roses are before the daffodils...

House 1   House 2   House 3
Roses   Carnations & Horses   Daffodils

*  The golfer and baseball player are together...

House 1   House 2   House 3
Roses   Golfer & Carnations & Horses   Daffodils & Baseball

So the horses are in **House 3 (A)**! 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses in a row.  

We know:

* House 1 has the person who likes oranges.
* House 3 has the person with horses.

The truck has to be next to the car that's not a truck, so the truck is in House 2!


(A) 2
"
"Okay, so we have five houses in a row, and each one has a person who likes different things!

We need to figure out where the drummer lives.  

Let's see... the clues tell us the drummer is next to the person who ate stew, and they're also to the right of the person who likes mystery books.

Hmm, that means the drummer can't be in the first house.

And the clues say the person who plays the guitar is right next to the drummer.

I think if we keep looking at the clues carefully, we can figure out where everyone lives!

...

(After carefully looking at all the clues)

The drummer lives in house number 4!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"This puzzle is like a big matching game!  We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to look at all the clues and see how they fit together.  

Let me see... hmm... I think I need to look at all the clues carefully and write down what I know.  

(The persona would then proceed to try and solve the puzzle using the clues provided, but might not arrive at the correct answer due to the complexity of the problem and the limited reasoning abilities of a person with a primary school education.) 



"
"Okay, so we have these houses and people, and we gotta figure out where the saxophonist lives!

It's like a puzzle! We have clues to help us.

Let's see... the green person is in house number 3, and they also have a radio!  And the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other.

Hmm, there are lots of clues about who lives next to who. We gotta think about it carefully.

After looking at all the clues, I think the saxophonist lives in house number 2.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, this is tricky!  

We know some people like different things, and they live in houses next to each other.  

The clues tell us a lot about who lives where, but it's hard to know for sure who has the horses. It could be in either house! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person has a different pet and flowers.

We know:

* The carnations are on the right side of the bird.
* The dog isn't in the middle house.
* The tulips are on the right side of the dog.

Hmmm... so the dog can't be in the middle house. That means the dog must be in the first house!

If the tulips are on the right side of the dog, they must be in the second house!


So the answer is (B). 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person wearing loafers lives in.  

There are clues about who lives where and what they have.  We gotta use the clues to put the puzzle together!

Let me see...

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the mango person lives in the first house.  And the horse person can't live in the first or second house.  

The banana person is next to the dog person, so they can't be in the last house.

That means the banana person must be in the second house and the dog person in the third!

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other, so they must be in the last two houses.

So the bird person must live in the fourth house!


**Answer: (B)** 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the mystery reader lives in the first house.  The bird person lives next to the history person. And the romance person can't be in the last house, and neither can the horse person.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 2!

We know the soccer player is in the middle house, that's number 2.

Hmmm... this is tricky!

*Looks at clues carefully*

I think the carnations are in house number 1!


So the answer is (A).
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each one has a person who plays a different instrument, wears different shoes, has a different thing like a phone or a gameboy, and drives a different kind of car.

We have to figure out which house the person who plays the drums lives in.

Hmmm... after looking at all the clues, I think the drummer lives in **House 1**. 


(A) 3
**(B) 2**
(C) 1
"
"The person eating apples lives in house number **(A) 4**. 

I know this because the puzzle tells us that!  It says right there that the person eating apples is in the fourth house. üçéüè†
"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and we need to find out where the coffee drinker lives.

We know the lilies are in the middle house. And the person with the roses is right next to the coffee drinker.  The SUV is also right next to the coffee drinker.

That means the coffee drinker must be in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person in the houses is different. One drives a car that goes down, one drives a big car, and one drives a car with no roof! They also ate different foods for lunch, like cheesy bread, long noodles, and a soup with meat and veggies. And they each have different flowers in their house, like red ones, yellow ones, and white ones with a smell.

We have some clues to figure out who lives where:

1. The person who likes the color blue lives next to the person who ate the long noodles.
2. The person who ate the soup lives somewhere before the person with the white smelly flowers.
3. The person with the red flowers lives next to the person who drives the big car.
4. The person who drives the car that goes down lives next to the person who ate the soup.
5. The person who likes the color red doesn't live in the first house.
6. The person who drives the car that goes down lives next to the person with the yellow flowers.

Hmm... let me think...

If the person who drives the car that goes down lives next to the person who ate the soup and the person with the yellow flowers, they must all be in a row! And the person who likes red doesn't live in the first house, so they must live in the last house!

That means the person who drives the big car lives in the last house too!

So the answer is (A) 3! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the sedan is in.  

There are lots of clues, but we can use them like puzzle pieces!

Let's see... the basketball player is in the last house, and the SUV is there too.  And the flutist is in the middle house.

Hmm, I think we need to look for clues about the sedan.  

Oh! The red color is right next to the sedan.

Let me think... I need to look for red and see what's next to it.

(After some time looking at the clues)

I got it! The sedan is in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the person with the gameboy is in the last house. And the person who likes red is in the middle house.  The person with grapes is to the right of the person who likes red, so they must be in the last house too!

The person with the phone is right next to the person with the running shoes. Since the last house is full, the phone must be in the first house!


So the answer is (C).
"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 2!  üê¶üè†  The puzzle tells us that right away. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are two houses, right? One person in each house.

* One likes tea, one likes water.

2. The saxophone player and golfer live next to each other.
3. The baseball player and grape eater live next to each other.
4. The saxophone player is in the first house.
5. The romance book lover and golfer live next to each other.

Hmmm...

The saxophone player is in the first house, and the grape eater is next to the tea drinker and the baseball player. So, the first house must have the saxophone player, the tea drinker, and the grape eater!

That means the baseball player and the mango eater must be in the second house.


So the answer is (A)!
"
"Okay, this puzzle is like a big matching game!  

We gotta figure out who lives in which house and what they like.  

It says the person with apples is in the fourth house. And the person with running shoes is in the first house. That's a good start!

Let's see... we gotta look for clues that tell us who lives next to who.  

Hmmm, this is tricky! I'm gonna try drawing a little picture to help me keep track.

"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

It's like a game of matching things up. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like to eat, wear, drink, and play!

I think the best way is to draw five boxes, one for each house. Then we can write down the clues and see if we can match them up.

It's gonna take some time, but I bet we can figure it out!

Hmmm... this is tricky! I'm gonna need to think really hard about all the clues.  

(Continues to think and analyze the clues) 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.

They like different things:

* One likes red, one likes yellow.
* One eats oranges, one eats grapes.
* One reads mysteries, one reads fantasy books.
* One has a truck, one has a car that goes down.
* One wears boots, one wears running shoes.

Here are the clues:

1. Grapes guy is next to the truck guy.
2. Boots guy is next to the mystery reader.
3. Yellow lover is next to the truck guy.

So, if the grapes guy is next to the truck guy, and the yellow lover is also next to the truck guy, they must be in a row: Yellow lover - Grapes guy - Truck guy.

And the boots guy is next to the mystery reader, so they must be together too.

That means the fantasy reader must be in the first house!

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. And the golfer lives in the last house.  The pizza person lives right before the basketball player.

So the answer is (C). 



"

* House 4 has the flutist, the horse person, and they like coffee!

Let me think...

* The tennis player can't be in house 4.
* The dog and root beer person live next to each other.
