"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is clear. The dog owner must live in **(B) 2**. 

We know the pianist lives in the first house. The one who loves root beer is to the right of the horse owner, so the horse owner cannot be in the second house.  And the one who likes white does not live in the second house either. This leaves only the second house for the dog owner.  



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is (B). 

The percussionist lives in the third house.  We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues about the books, meals, and instruments. 



"
"Peace be upon you.

Let us ponder this puzzle together.

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person with daffodils lives next door.  Also, the horses are next to the daffodils. This means the horses must be in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is (A) 2. 

We can figure this out by thinking carefully about the clues. The person with the apples is in the last house, and the mango eater is right next to them. This means the coffee drinker must be in the first house, and the milk drinker is next to them in the second house.  



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(C) 2**. 

We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues. The science fiction reader lives in the middle house, and we know the boots are not in the last house.  This means the boots must be in the second house.  



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle is quite simple. We can deduce the answer by carefully considering the clues.

The water drinker is in the first house, and the lilies are in the second.  Since the milk drinker must be one house away from the water drinker, they must be in the third house. This leaves the third house for the roses.

* The person who likes yellow is in the third house and is a tennis player.

Let's think about the clues about the phone and the radio...

Aha! The phone must be in the second house, and the radio in the third.

Now, the cricketer is just to the left of the person with sandals...

*  This means the cricketer must be in house number **2**. 

So the answer is **(D)**.

Clue number 4 tells us this directly. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle is like a beautiful tapestry, each clue a thread weaving a pattern. Let us unravel it together.

Aha! The guitarist must be somewhere to the left of the carnations, and the basketball player is just to the left of the guitarist.  The baseball player is next to the basketball player.

We also know the sandals are to the left of the tulips, and the running shoes are to the left of the daffodils. The lilies are to the right of the high heels, and the loafers are to the left of the percussionist.

Finally, there are two houses between the sandals and the cellist.

*Masha'Allah*, with careful consideration, we can deduce the house number where the sandals are located.

The answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Peace be upon you.

Let us consider the clues carefully. We know the person in the second house ate grilled cheese.  The clue about the high heels tells us they are in the first house, next to the fish enthusiast. This means the stew must be with the person in the first house.

The violinist lives in house number 3.  We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues about the houses and the people who live in them. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle is quite straightforward. We can solve it by carefully considering each clue.

The television is in the fourth house, and the loafers are in the second. The person with the phone cannot be in the second house.  The boots must be to the left of the loafers, so they are in the first house.

Knowing the radio and sandals are separated by two houses, we can deduce the radio is in the first house and the sandals in the third. This leaves the phone in the third house and the gameboy in the first.

Therefore, the person with the gameboy lives in house **(C) 1**. 



"
"The person wearing high heels lives in house number **(B) 2**. 

The clue tells us this directly.  



"
"Peace be upon you.

"
"As-salamu alaykum!

The coffee drinker lives in house number **(E) 4**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle is quite straightforward. We can figure this out step by step.

Let's see... the clues tell us the SUV is next to the lilies, and the sedan is next to the roses.  The roses can't be in the middle house, so they must be in house 2, with the sedan in house 1. This means the SUV is in house 1 and the lilies in house 2.

Since the tulips aren't in the last house, they must be in house 1. That leaves the truck for house 3.

So the answer is (C).

The answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is (C) 1. 

We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues. The green lover is in the third house, and the yellow lover is next to them, so yellow must be in the second house.  The stew eater is to the left of the romance lover, and the fantasy lover is to the right of the stew eater. This means the stew eater must be in the first house, the romance lover in the second, and the fantasy lover in the third.  That leaves the blue lover for the first house.

By considering these connections, and remembering that the cellist is not in the third house, we can piece together the solution.

The bird keeper must live in house number **(B) 2**.

"
"Bismillah. This puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns we see in the natural world, each element connected to the next. Let's see...

The clues tell us the romance book lover lives two houses away from the mystery reader.  Since the mystery reader must be in the first house (clue 1 and 9), the romance book lover must be in the third house.

But wait! The rose bouquet is also in the third house (clue 6). This means the romance book lover must be in the **fourth house (B)**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns woven into a fine carpet. Each clue is a thread, and we must carefully weave them together to reveal the complete design.

Let us see... the key is to consider each clue in relation to the others. For example, we know the coffee drinker resides in the third house, and the milk drinker in the fifth. This limits the possibilities for the other houses.

We must also remember that each house has only one person, and each person has only one of each item. This eliminates many possibilities.

With careful consideration and patience, we can deduce the answer.

The person with the vase of tulips lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"As-salamu alaykum! This puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns we see in the natural world, each element connected to the next.

Let's see... the minivan is in the third house, and the person wearing boots is right next to it, so they must be in the second house.  The golfer is in the first house, which means the cricketer is in the second and the tennis player in the third.

Since the rose bouquet isn't in the second house, and the minivan is in the third, the rose bouquet must be in the first house.

We see the houses laid out before us, each with its own secrets. The dog owner, a loyal soul, resides in the second house. And the fish enthusiast, peaceful and contemplative, dwells in the third.

The clues guide us like stars in the night sky. We learn the minivan is not in the third house, and the gameboy is not in the second. The minivan must be to the right of the dog owner, placing it in either the fourth or fifth house.

The truck and computer are companions, the truck always to the left. And the tulips and convertible are inseparable, as are the carnations and tulips.

"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(B) 2**. 

We can figure this out by thinking carefully about the clues. The pianist and kiwi eater must be next to each other, and the violinist is somewhere to the left of the kiwi eater.  Also, the grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater. This means the pianist must be in the middle house. 



"
"The person eating kiwis lives in house number 1.  The fantasy book enthusiast cannot live there, so they must live in house number 2.

**(B) 2**

"The answer is (D) 3.

"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is (C). 

We can deduce this by carefully considering the clues. The rose bouquet is in the second house, and the science fiction lover is next to it. This means the science fiction lover is in the third house.

Let us consider this puzzle carefully.

We know the person with high heels lives to the left of the one with sandals, and the grape eater and sandal wearer are neighbors. This means the order must be high heels, grapes, then sandals.

"
"Peace be upon you.

Let us consider this puzzle carefully.

We know the bird keeper cannot be in the second house because the grilled cheese eater lives to their right. Also, the percussionist cannot be in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in the first house.

* The root beer lover lives in the first house.
* The daffodils are next to the phone, meaning the daffodils are in the middle house and the phone is in the last house.
* The television is to the right of the tulips, so the tulips must be in the first house and the television in the last house.

This leaves only the first house for the milk drinker.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in **house 1 (A)**.

"
"The truck must be in House 2.

We also know the person with the television is next to the one who likes red, and the green lover is in the third house with the radio.

After carefully considering all the clues, I see that the saxophonist must live in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Peace be upon you.

This is a puzzle of logic, and I, Muhammad, will use my wisdom to solve it.

Therefore, the answer is: We cannot determine if the horse owner lives in house 1 or house 2. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(B) 2**. 

We can figure this out by thinking carefully about the clues. The tulips must be to the right of the dog, and the carnations are to the right of the bird.

We need to find the house with the person wearing loafers.  

* The clues tell us where some things are *not* located, which is just as helpful as knowing where they *are*.

* We know the swimmer is in the last house, and the cricketer is next to the tulips.

* The person with the phone is to the left of the sandals, and the oranges are to the left of the computer.

*  The gameboy is to the left of the basketball player.

Let me ponder these connections...

*Aha!*  I believe the person wearing loafers lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, we can solve this riddle. Let us think step by step.

We know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. The horses cannot be in the first or second house.  The banana must be to the left of the dog owner. This means the banana is in the second house and the dog owner in the third.

The bird keeper and kiwi eater are neighbors. The only place left for them is the third and fourth houses. Since the dog owner is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is clear. The romance book lover lives in **(B) house 2**. 

We know the mystery reader is in the first house. The bird keeper is next to the history buff, and neither the romance reader nor the horse owner is in the last house. This leaves only house 2 for the romance book lover.  



"
"As-salamu alaykum!

The coffee drinker lives in house number **(D) 2**. 

It is clear from the clues given.  



"
"As-salamu alaykum!

The answer is **(D) 3**.  

The clue says the person eating the banana lives in the third house. 



"
"By Allah's grace, I have pondered the clues and found the answer. The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(A) 3**. 

We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues.  The clues tell us about the order of the houses and who lives where.  It takes some thought, but by looking at the relationships between the instruments, shoes, devices, and cars, we can deduce the solution. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(A) 4**. 

We can deduce this by carefully considering the clues given.  The placement of the daffodils, television, lilies, and pianist helps us establish a sequence. From there, we can use the clues about the fruits, instruments, and other items to fill in the rest. 



"
"Peace be upon you.

Let us use logic to solve this riddle. We know the person with lilies is in the middle house.  The clues tell us the coffee drinker is to the right of both the rose bouquet and the SUV. This means the coffee drinker must be in the last house.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is clear.  

The truck driver lives in **House 3 (A)**. 

We can see this by carefully considering the clues about the houses, their occupants, and their belongings.  May peace be upon you. 



"
"*Bismillah*, this puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns in Islamic art. Each detail connects to another, just like these clues. Let's see...

We need to find the house with the sedan.  

* The flutist is in house 3, and the cellist is next to them, so the cellist must be in house 2.
* The basketball player is in house 4, and the SUV is also in house 4.

We can keep going like this, using each clue to build a picture.

...

After carefully considering all the clues, I find that the person who owns the sedan lives in **(A) 1**. 



"
"As-salamu alaykum! This puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns we see in the natural world, each element connected to the next.

Let's see... the person with the gameboy is in the third house, and the one who likes red is in the second.  The grapes must be in the third house, since they are to the right of red.  This means white must be in the first house.

Ah, the phone is to the left of the running shoes, and the third house is already full. So, the phone must be in the first house!

The answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Peace be upon you. The answer is **(C) 2**.  The bird keeper lives in the second house. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is clear. 

The mango eater must live in **house 2**. 

We know the saxophonist is in house 1, and they are next to the golfer and the tea drinker. The baseball player is also next to the grape eater. This leaves only house 2 for the mango eater and the science fiction lover.  



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns woven into a fine carpet. Each clue is a thread, and we must carefully weave them together to see the full design.

Let's see... we have two houses and need to figure out where the fantasy book lover lives.

We know some things:

* The person eating grapes lives next to the truck driver, and the yellow lover is also next to the truck driver. So, it must be Yellow-lover - Grapes - Truck Driver.
* The boots wearer is next to the mystery reader.

This means the fantasy reader must be in the other house.

"As-salamu alaykum!

Let's see... we have three houses and three people, each with their own instrument and sport.  

The violinist and basketball player are the same person, living in the middle house. The cellist must be in the last house because they live to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer is in the first house, and the soccer player must be in the first house.

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(A) 1**. 

We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues about the houses and their inhabitants.  The tea drinker must be to the right of the one who likes red, and the carnations are to the right of the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 4.  We also know the mystery book reader is in house 4, so the tea drinker must be in house 1. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle is like a beautiful tapestry, each clue a thread weaving a pattern. Let us unravel it together.

We know the coffee drinker and the flutist both reside in the fourth house, and the horse lover is also there.  The tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, and neither can the guitarist or violinist be in the third.

The guitarist must be to the right of the cricketer, and the dog owner and root beer lover are neighbors. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player, and the water drinker and tennis player are neighbors.

With careful consideration, we can deduce the placement of each person and their characteristics.

The fish enthusiast lives in house **(C) 2**. 



"
"The pianist lives in house number 2, and the person with daffodils lives next door. So the daffodils must be in house number 1.

**(A)**

"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is clear. The root beer lover must live in **house 2 (B)**. 

We know the soccer player is in the second house, and the person who likes blue lives to the left of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover cannot be in the first house. 



"
"Bismillah. This puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns we see in the natural world, each element connected to the next. Let us unravel this mystery step by step.

Let me ponder these clues further and I will tell you where the swimmer resides. 

"
"The bird keeper lives in house number **(B) 2**. 

The violinist is in the first house, and the computer owner is also in the first house because they are to the left of the bird keeper.  This means the bird keeper must be in the second house. 



"
"By Allah's grace, this puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns woven into a fine carpet. Each clue is a thread, and we must carefully weave them together to see the full design.

...

(After carefully analyzing all the clues)

The computer is in **(A) 3**. 



"
"By Allah's grace, the answer is **(C) 3**. 

We can figure this out by carefully considering the clues. The person with the boots lives in the middle house, and the sedan is in the last house.  The clues tell us about the positions of the high heels, the dog, and the SUV, which helps us place the running shoes in the last house. 



"
"*Peace be upon you.*

This puzzle reminds me of the intricate patterns we see in the natural world, each element connected to the next. Let us unravel this mystery together.

We know the tea drinker lives in the third house, and the first house has carnations and running shoes. The second house has tulips.  

The person who likes milk and the person eating apples must be neighbors.  We also know the kiwi eater is next to the person who likes blue.

Let us ponder these connections carefully, and we shall find the answer.

*(After some thoughtful silence)*

Ah, I see it now! The person eating apples lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Peace be upon you.

Let us consider this puzzle carefully.

We know the mystery reader is in the first house.  The history buff lives to the right of the mystery reader, so they must be in the second house. The person with the television is also next to the mystery reader, meaning they are in the second house as well.

This leaves the third house for the person with the computer.  Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
