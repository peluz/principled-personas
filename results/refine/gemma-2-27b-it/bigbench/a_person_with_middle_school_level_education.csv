"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tulips are.  

We know the flutist lives in house number 2. And the person with tulips is right next to the guitarist.  

The lilies are right next to the carnations, and the pianist is one house away from the flutist.

Hmmm... if the pianist is next to the flutist, they'd be in house 1 or 3.  But if the pianist is in house 1, there's no room for the tulips to be next to the guitarist. So the pianist must be in house 3!

That means the tulips have to be in house 1 to be next to the guitarist in house 2.


So the answer is (C) 1.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cellist lives.  Let's see...

* We know the person who likes green lives in the first house, and they're eating kiwis.
* The person with the TV is somewhere to the left of the root beer lover, and the water drinker is also to the left of the root beer lover. So it's like TV - Water - Root Beer.
* The cellist and the person with the gameboy live next to each other, and the blue lover is right next to the gameboy player.
* Oh, and the percussionist doesn't live in the middle house.

Hmm... let me draw it out:

House 1: Kiwis, Green, ?
House 2: ?, ?, ?
House 3: ?, ?, ?

Okay, so the cellist and gameboy player have to be in houses 2 and 3, and the blue lover is with them. That means the cellist must be in house 3!


So the answer is (C).
"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who eats what, drinks what, wears what, plays what sport, and their favorite color.

The clues are super important. Let's see...

* Clue 5 says the kiwi eater is in house number 5.
* Clue 15 says the tennis player is also in house 5.

Hmm, that's a good start! We can write that down.

We gotta keep going through all the clues and see if we can figure out where everyone else is. It might take a while, but we can do it!

...

(After carefully working through the clues, you would eventually find the house number where the person who likes green lives and select the corresponding letter option.) 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is like a big matching game!  

Let's see... we gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

* We know the person in house number 1 eats apples.
* And the person in house number 3 wears high heels.

Hmm, let me think about the other clues...  

It's gonna take some time to figure out all the connections, but I'll try my best!

(I'm still working on it, but I'll let you know when I figure out where the tea drinker lives!) 



"
"The answer is (A) 5.

The puzzle says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.  
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the daffodil person lives.  

Let's see... the soccer player lives to the left of the orange eater, and the daffodil person lives to the right of the orange eater. So it's gotta be like this: Soccer Player - Orange Eater - Daffodil Person.

And the swimmer lives right next to the daffodil person.

Oh, and the tulip person is to the right of the mango eater.

Hmm... I think it goes like this:

Mango Eater - Tulip Person - Soccer Player - Orange Eater - Swimmer - Daffodil Person

So the daffodil person lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the tulips.  Let's see...

* We know the violinist lives in the first house.
* The person with the daffodils is somewhere to the left of whoever plays the drums.
* And the tulips are next to the phone.

Hmm, that's tricky.  I think we need to look at all the clues together to figure this out.  It's like a puzzle!

Let me think...

(After some more thinking)

I think the tulips must be in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the gameboy.  Let's see...

It says the bird person doesn't live in the first or last house, so they must be in the middle one. And the mystery book reader is also in the middle house.

Then it says the history book person is right next to the lilies, so they must be in the first house.

The gameboy person is right next to the roses, so they gotta be in the last house!

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

We need to figure out which house the person with the phone lives in.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful!

I think the best way is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, who lives there, what they eat, what pet they have, what gadget they have, and what flowers are in their house.

Then we can use the clues to fill in the blanks. It's like a detective game!

...

(After some time spent working on the puzzle)

Okay, I think I got it!  The person with the phone lives in **House #4**. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  

We know some stuff about them:

* One wears sandals, one wears boots.
* One likes mysteries, one likes history books.
* One drives a convertible, one drives a truck.

Here are the clues:

1. The convertible person lives to the left of the history buff.
2. The boots person doesn't live in the first house.

So, if the convertible is to the left of the history buff, that means the convertible person is in house 1 and the history buff is in house 2.

Since the boots person isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2. That means the sandals person has to be in house 1!


**Answer: (A) 1** 

"
"Okay, so we have these houses and people, and we gotta figure out where the basketball player lives.

* We know the golfer lives in the first house.
* The swimmer is right next to the romance book lover, and the swimmer isn't in the third house. So the swimmer must be in the second house and the romance lover is in the third!
* The mystery book reader is right next to the history book buff. Since the first house is taken, the mystery reader must be in the second house.
* Oh, and the basketball player can't be in the last house.

That means the basketball player has to be in the third house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number **(B) 3**.  Clue number 3 tells us that! üìöüè† 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and three people. Each person has a different thing - a phone, a computer, or a Gameboy - and they each like a different color - yellow, blue, or green.

We have some clues to figure out who lives where:

1. The green person lives right next to the Gameboy person.
2. The Gameboy person lives right next to the computer person.
3. The yellow person doesn't live in the middle house.

Let's see... if the green person is next to the Gameboy person, they have to be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.  And the computer person has to be after the Gameboy person.

Since the yellow person can't be in the middle house, the only way it works is if:

* House 1: Green person
* House 2: Gameboy person
* House 3: Computer person

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the coffee drinker lives.  There are clues about colors, drinks, and books, and we gotta match them up to the houses.

Let's see... the root beer lover is in house number 3, and the person who likes red is also in house 3.  That means coffee can't be in house 3.

The clues say coffee is to the right of green, so coffee can't be in house 1 or 2 either. That leaves only house number 4 for the coffee drinker!

So the answer is (B) 4. 



"
"Okay, so we have these two houses, right?  One person in each.  We gotta figure out who has the cat.

Here's what we know:

* The fantasy book person is in house number 1.
* The pizza person is NOT in house number 1.
* The green lover is right next to the radio person.
* The fish person is NOT in house number 1.

So, if the fantasy person is in house 1, and the pizza person isn't, the pizza person must be in house 2.  

Since the green lover is next to the radio person, they have to be in house 1 and 2.  

And since the fish person isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2.

That means the cat lover has to be in house 1!


**Answer: (A) 1**
"
"This puzzle seems super hard!  

Okay, so it says there are five houses in a row, and each one has a person with different stuff like pets and favorite foods.  We gotta figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

Hmm, let's see... Clue number 4 says the dog owner lives in the second house. And clue 14 says the dog owner lives next to the person who likes red. So the person who likes red must live in house number 3!

I'm gonna try writing down all the clues and see if I can figure out the rest. This is gonna take some time! 



"
"The person eating kiwis lives in house number **(A) 1**. Clue number 8 tells us that! 

"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... it's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they're eating and what flowers they have.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues!  We gotta look for clues that tell us things are right next to each other, like clue 1 says the roses are right next to the grilled cheese.

And clue 6 says pizza is to the left of grilled cheese.  

I think we need to write it all down to keep track.  

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I'm gonna keep going and see if I can figure out where the stew is!

...

*after some more scribbling*

Got it! The stew is in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the fish person lives.  

Let's see...

* We know the cat person is in the first house.
* The tulip person is right next to the dog person.
* The horse person is somewhere before the carnation person, with one house in between.
* And the lily person is somewhere after the horse person.

Hmm... if we try putting the pieces together, it looks like this:

1. Cat Lover, Daffodils
2. Horse Owner, Tulips
3. Dog Owner, Carnations
4. Fish Enthusiast, Lilies

So the fish person lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  

We know the phone guy is in house number 1. And the boots person doesn't live in house number 2, so they must be in house number 1 too.

The clue about the horses and the radio means they're next to each other. Since the phone guy is in house 1, the horses and radio must be in houses 1 and 2.

That means the high heels person has to be in house number 2!

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes green and what house they live in. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see...

* We know the person who ate grilled cheese and the computer person live next to each other, and grilled cheese isn't in the last house.
* Loafers aren't in the last house either.
* Apples aren't in the first house, and pizza isn't in the second house.

Hmm, this is tricky.  

* Oh! Grapes have to be to the right of boots, and the phone has to be one house away from the blue lover.

Let me try drawing it out...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who likes green lives in **house 3**.

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives.  Let's see...

* We know the baseball player is in house number 2.
* The basketball player is before the swimmer, and can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 3, and the swimmer is in house 4.
* The tennis player is right next to the cat lover, so they're in houses 1 and 2.
* The bird keeper can't be in houses 1 or 3.

That means the bird keeper has to be in house **(C) 4**! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the soccer player lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are three houses, and each person is different.  We have clues to help us.

We need to think about where each person lives based on their favorite color, car, what they play, and what they have.

It's kinda like a game of connect the dots, but with houses and stuff!

I'm gonna try drawing it out on paper to keep track.

...

(After some time thinking and drawing)

Okay, I think I got it!  

The soccer player lives in house **(B) 3**. 



"
"It says right here in clue 11 that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. So the answer is (E) 1. 

"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and we gotta figure out who has the TV.  

Let's see... there's a pianist, a violinist, and someone who plays drums. And they each have different shoes and eat different fruits and have different stuff like a TV, phone, or radio.

There are a bunch of clues, so let's go one by one:

* The pianist doesn't live in the first house.
* The person with oranges lives to the right of the person with kiwis.
* The high heels person and the pianist live next to each other.
* The running shoes person and the drummer live next to each other.
* The kiwis person lives to the left of the boots person.
* The radio person lives to the left of the high heels person.
* The oranges person lives right next to the TV person.

Hmm, this is tricky! Let me try drawing it out...

Okay, I think I got it! The TV person has to be in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the sedan is parked.  There are clues about drinks, food, and colors too.  

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House Number* | *Car* | *Drink* | *Fruit* | *Color*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |         |         |         |         
2        |         |         |         |         
3        |         |         |         |         
4        |         |         |         |         
5        |         |         |         |         

Hmm, it's like a big matching game! I'll start filling it in as I figure things out.

(I'll need a bit more time to solve the whole thing, but this is how I'd start!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the SUV.

We know the person in the first house eats kiwis.  And the truck person doesn't live in the first or third house, so they must be in the middle house.  

Since the SUV person can't be in the last house, they gotta be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate spaghetti.

We know the fried rice person is in house number 3. And the spaghetti person is right next to them, so they must be in house number 2!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the person wearing boots lives.  This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... the person who likes blue lives in the last house, house number 5. And the person who likes white lives in house number 4.

Hmm, the clues say the truck is next to the sandals, and the loafers are somewhere before the truck.  And boots are before the truck too.

I think I'm starting to get it!  Let me try drawing it out...

... Boots ... Loafers ... Truck ... Sandals ...

Oh! The truck can't be in house 4 because the white-liking person is there.

So the truck must be in house 3!

That means the boots have to be in house 1 or 2.

I'm gonna guess the boots are in house **(A) 2**. 



"
"The history book buff lives in house number 1. Clue number 2 says so! üìöüè†  

"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where, what they like to eat, what they play, and what kind of books they read.

I'd start by writing down all the clues and then making a list of all the things we need to figure out:

* **Houses:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* **Instruments:** Violin, Flute, Cello, Saxophone, Piano
* **Fruits:** Kiwis, Mangos, Oranges, Grapes, Apples
* **Sports:** Basketball, Cricket, Soccer, Swimming, Baseball
* **Books:** Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi, History, Mystery
* **Lunch:** Fried Rice, Grilled Cheese, Stew, Pizza, Spaghetti

Then I'd start looking for clues that tell me something for sure, like ""The soccer player lives in the first house.""  

After that, I'd look for clues that connect things, like ""The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.""

It's gonna take some time, but I bet we can crack this! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes green and what house they live in.  

Let's see...

* We know the history buff is in the middle house.
* The person with the daffodils is also in the middle house.
* The loafers are in the last house.

Hmm... the person who likes yellow can't be in the first or last house. So they must be in the middle house with the history buff and the daffodils.

The person with the boots is next to the yellow-liking person, so they must be in the first house.

That means the green-liking person is in the first house too!

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"It says right in the clues that the person with running shoes lives in the first house! So the answer is (B) 1. üëüüè†  



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the basketball player lives.

We know the cricketer is in the first house.  And the person with the truck is to the right of the basketball player. That means the basketball player can't be in the last house.

Also, the horses are next to the sedan.

So, the basketball player has to be in the **middle house (B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle seems super hard!  

Okay, so there are five houses and each one has a different person with different stuff. We gotta figure out where the tulips are.

Let's see... there are a lot of clues! I'm gonna try writing down the important stuff.

* Clue 4 says the radio is in house number 4. That's a good start!

*  Hmm, some clues say things are next to each other, like the rose bouquet and daffodils.

I'm gonna try drawing a little picture to keep track of everything.  

This is gonna take some time, but I'll try my best to figure it out! 



"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person with the sedan lives.  There are clues about shoes, food, drinks, and cars.

Hmm, let me think...

* Clue 6 says the sedan isn't next to the water drinker.
* And clue 7 says the running shoes are in house number 2.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cellist lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's write them down and see if we can match them up:

* The saxophonist is in house number 2.
* The tea drinker is in house number 4.
* The cellist is right next to the tea drinker.
* The person who had pizza is to the right of the saxophonist.
* The person with sandals is to the left of the milk drinker.
* The person with sandals is also to the right of the person who ate stew.
* The cellist is right next to the person who ate fried rice.
* The person who had pizza is to the right of the person with running shoes.
* The flutist isn't in house number 4.

Okay, so if the cellist is right next to the tea drinker in house 4, then the cellist must be in house 3! 


**Answer: (C) 3**
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drives the truck.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* Clue 9 says the minivan is in the last house, number 4.
* Clue 10 says the root beer lover is in house number 3.

Hmm, that's a good start!  Let me see if I can use those clues and the others to figure out the rest.

*  Clue 8 says the basketball player is right next to the truck driver.

Okay, so they have to be together somewhere.

I'm gonna try drawing it out, like a little map of the houses.  Maybe that will help!

...

(After some scribbling)

Aha! I think I got it! The truck driver is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks coffee and what house they live in.  

Let's see...

* We know the tea drinker is in the first house.
* Someone with apples lives to the left of the minivan person.
* The convertible is to the right of the science fiction book lover.
* The fantasy book person and the coffee person live one house apart.
* And the orange eater isn't in the second house.

Hmm... I think if we draw it out, it'll be easier.

* House 1: Tea drinker, maybe apples?
* House 2:  Could be the minivan, maybe science fiction books?
* House 3:  Maybe the coffee person?

Let's see... if the coffee person is in house 3, then the fantasy book person must be in house 2. That fits with the clue about them being one house apart!

So, the coffee drinker lives in **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and people who like different colors and books. Let's see...

* We know the red lover is in the middle house because it says so right there!
* And the mystery book person is in the last house because the red person is right next to them.
* The white lover can't be in the last house, so they must be in the first one.
* That means the fantasy book person has to be in the first house too, because they can't be in the last one.


So the answer is (C) 1.
"
"The SUV guy lives in house number 3! Clue number 5 says so. 

(A) 3 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the root beer lover lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are three houses, and each person is different.  They like different fruits, have different flowers, play different instruments, drink different things, and have different stuff like a radio or TV.

We have some clues to help us.  Like, the TV person is right next to the tea drinker, and the kiwi eater is somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

We gotta use all the clues to figure out who lives where and what they like. It's like a detective game!

I'm gonna try drawing it out on paper to keep track of everything.  

...

(After some scribbling and muttering)

Okay, I think I got it!  The root beer lover lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's reading sci-fi and what house they're in.  

Let's see...

* We know the fantasy book person is in house number 3.
* The sci-fi person is to the right of them, so they must be in house number 4!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  We gotta figure out who wears sandals.

Here's what we know:

* One person ate spaghetti and the other ate fried rice.
* One person plays the flute and the other plays the cello.
* One person wears loafers and the other wears sandals.
* One person likes white and the other likes green.
* One person has a sedan and the other has an SUV.

The clues tell us:

* The fried rice eater doesn't live in the first house.
* The SUV owner doesn't live in the second house.
* The flute player lives to the left of the person who likes white.
* The loafer wearer lives to the left of the person who likes white.

Let's see... if the fried rice eater isn't in the first house, they must be in the second house. And if the SUV owner isn't in the second house, they must be in the first.

The flute player is to the left of the white lover, so the flute player is in the first house and the white lover is in the second.

And since the loafer wearer is to the left of the white lover, the loafer wearer is in the first house too.

That means the sandal wearer must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and we gotta figure out where the violinist lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about flowers, food, cars, instruments, and drinks.

* We know the person who likes water lives next to the minivan person.
* The root beer lover is in the last house.
* The sedan is somewhere before the mango eater.
* The sedan is also right before the daffodils.
* And the cellist is right before the saxophonist.

If we put all that together, we can figure out where everyone lives and what they like!

...

After looking at all the clues, I think the violinist lives in **house 1**.  (C) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person wearing loafers lives in. This is like a big puzzle!

There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta look for ones that tell us about the loafers directly or give us hints about where they might be.

Let's see... hmm, clue number 7 says the person who ate spaghetti lives one house away from the person wearing loafers.  And clue number 9 says the loafers are to the right of the cat lover.

We need to look for more clues about the cat lover and spaghetti to figure out where the loafers are. This is gonna take some thinking! 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* House 1 has the TV.
* The lilies aren't in house 1.

That means the lilies must be in house 2!  If house 1 has the TV, then house 2 must have the computer.

**Answer: (A) 2** 

"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They each like different stuff.  Let's see...

* One likes history books and the other likes science fiction.
* One eats pizza and the other eats spaghetti.
* One has tulips and the other has daffodils.
* One plays baseball and the other plays golf.
* One plays guitar and the other plays something else, like drums maybe?

The clues tell us:

1. The science fiction person lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The pizza person and the history person live right next to each other.
3. The guitar player lives to the right of the daffodils.

Hmm... so the golfer can't be in the first house because the science fiction person has to be to their left. That means the golfer is in the second house.

Since the pizza and history people are next to each other, they must be in the first house.

And the guitar player is to the right of the daffodils, so they must be in the second house too.

That means the percussionist must be in the first house!

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about who lives where and what they have.  We know the violinist is in the fourth house and the bird keeper is in the fifth.  

The clues about the gameboy, TV, and radio help us figure out who's next to who. And the clues about the horses and fish person being next to each other are important too.

If we use all the clues, we can figure out that the percussionist lives in house number 2.


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  

We know:

* House 1 has lilies.
* The basketball player isn't in House 1.

That means the basketball player is in House 2!

The clues say the radio is to the right of both the apples and the violinist. So the violinist has to be in House 1, right?

**Answer: (A) 1** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cricketer lives.  

Let's see... there are five houses, and each one has a different person who plays a sport and ate something different.

We know the tennis player is in the third house, and the golfer is in the fourth. The grilled cheese eater is in the fifth house.

The clues say the fried rice and spaghetti people live next to each other, and the pizza person is somewhere before the cricketer.

Hmmm...  Since the tennis player is before the soccer player, and the golfer is in the fourth house, the soccer player must be in the fifth house.

That means the cricketer has to be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing loafers.  

Let's see...

* We know the guy who eats spaghetti lives in one house and the baseball player lives in the other. They're right next door to each other.
* The person who likes white lives next to the spaghetti eater.
* The water drinker is also next to the spaghetti eater.

So, the spaghetti eater must be in house 1, and the baseball player is in house 2. The white lover is in house 1 too, and the water drinker is in house 2.

That means the person in house 2 must be wearing the loafers!

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and three people. Each person likes a different fruit and drink.  Let's see...

* The coffee person lives to the left of the mango person.
* The water person lives to the right of the root beer person.
* The root beer person doesn't live in the middle house.
* The orange person doesn't live in the middle house either.

Hmm... if the root beer person isn't in the middle, and the orange person isn't either, then the mango person *must* be in the middle house! That means the coffee person is in the first house.

So, the root beer person has to be in the last house.

The answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing loafers.

We know the person in the first house ate spaghetti.  And the fried rice person isn't in the second house.  

The boots person is right next to the fried rice person, so they can't be in the first house either. That means the fried rice person is in the last house, and the boots person is in the middle house.

Since the loafers person isn't in the first house, they gotta be in the middle house with the boots!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"This puzzle is like a big detective case! We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to look at all the clues and see how they fit together.  I'm gonna try making a list of who likes what and see if I can match them up to the houses.

Let me see...

Hmmm... this is tricky!  I'll keep working on it. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the lilies. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are a bunch of clues, and we gotta use them to figure out who lives where and what they like.

(C) 1 



"
"Okay, so we know the mystery book person lives in house number 1.  And the tennis player doesn't live there. That means the tennis player must live in house number 2.  So the fantasy book person has to live in house number 2 too!

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes white and what house they live in. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about what people eat, what they wear, what flowers they have, and what music they play.  We gotta use all those clues to figure it out.

It's gonna take some thinking, but I bet we can do it!  

(I'd need to see the clues to actually solve it, though!) 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

We need to figure out who drinks only water and what house they live in.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful!

I think the best way is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to fill in the blanks.  It's like a detective game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need some paper and a pencil for this one.  

(The solver would then proceed to work through the puzzle using the clues provided.) 



"
"The person who likes red lives in house number **(C) 1**.  

Clue number one tells us that straight up! 

"
"This puzzle is like a detective game! We gotta figure out who lives where and what they have.

It's gonna take some time to look at all the clues and see how they fit together.  I'm gonna try writing down all the stuff about each house, like who has what pet and what they're wearing.

Maybe if we look for clues that say something is in a *specific* house, like ""the swimmer lives in the fourth house,"" we can start filling things in.

Then we can use the other clues to figure out the rest. It's like a puzzle where each clue is a piece!

Let me see... I'll get back to you when I think I've got it! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The kiwi eater is in house number 1.
* The science fiction book lover is in house number 2.

The bird person and the high heel wearer are neighbors, and so are the tennis player and the apple eater.  Since the kiwi eater is already in house 1, the bird person and high heel wearer must be in house 2. That means the tennis player and apple eater are also in house 2.

The dog owner can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 1.

That leaves the cricketer! They have to be in house 1.

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... we need to find out who's eating grapes and what house they live in.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful!

I'm gonna try writing down all the stuff we know about each house, like who lives there, what they eat, and what they like to do. Maybe if we see a pattern, it'll help us find the grape eater! 

*grabs a piece of paper and starts scribbling*

This is gonna take some time...  



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the green lover is in house number 1.
* And the fried rice person is in house number 4.

Hmm, some clues say things are next to each other, like pizza and roses, and pizza and apples.  

Let me see... I think the pizza person is in house number 2.  

So the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating mangos.

We know the baseball player lives in house number 2 and drives a convertible.  And the grape eater doesn't live in house number 1.

That means the mango person has to be in house number 1!

So the answer is (B) 1. 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes white.

We know the blue person is in the middle house. And the apple person is right next to the orange person.  

Since the kiwi person is to the right of the blue person, they must be in the last house. That means the green person is in the first house.

The white person has to be to the right of the green person, so they must be in the last house too!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the rose bouquet.

We know a few things:

* The root beer person lives to the right of the roses.
* The soccer player is right next to the mystery book reader.
* The gameboy person is to the left of the mystery book reader.

Since the root beer person is to the right of the roses, the roses have to be in House 1! 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we have these four houses in a row, and each one has a person with a different pet and car.  Let's see...

* The minivan person lives to the right of the fish person.
* The truck person is right next to the sedan person.
* The truck person is two houses away from the dog person.
* The fish person is right next to the dog person.
* And the cat person doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... let me draw it out:

[Truck][Sedan] [Fish][Dog]

Oh! The minivan has to be in the last house!

[Truck][Sedan] [Fish][Dog][Minivan]

That means the cat person must be in the first house!

So the dog person lives in house number **3**. 

The answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes blue and what house they live in.

* We know the root beer lover is in house number 2.
* And the person who likes yellow is in house number 3.

* The clue says the blue lover is to the right of the yellow lover, so blue can't be in house 1 or 2.

* That means the blue lover must be in house number 4! 


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and we gotta figure out where the bird person lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see...

* We know the person who likes blue lives in the middle house.
* The cricket player is in the last house, and they're to the right of whoever eats oranges.
* The baseball player is in the first house, and they're to the left of the cat person.

Hmm... that means the dog person must be in the first house too, because they're to the left of whoever likes green.

And the sandals are to the right of the dog person, so they must be in the middle house.

Let me think... that means the bird person has to be in the middle house too!

So the answer is (C) 2. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

Let's see... the clues tell us some people are in certain houses already. Like, the horse person is in house number 1, and the dog person is in house number 4.

We also know the coffee drinker is in house number 5 and the cricketer is in house number 4.

Hmm, I think we need to look for clues that connect things, like who lives next to who.

Oh! The tennis player lives right next to the bird person.  We gotta find them!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!

The tennis player lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle seems tricky!  Let's see...

We need to figure out where the history book buff lives.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, who lives there, what they like to eat, what they read, and their favorite color.

Then, we can use the clues to fill in the blanks. It's like a detective game!

I'm gonna try to work it out on paper.  Give me a sec...

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The history book buff lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.  

We know some stuff about them:

* One plays guitar, one plays cello.
* One has a computer, one has a Gameboy.
* One has a dog, one has fish.

The clues tell us:

1. The cello player is right next to the Gameboy person.
2. The dog person doesn't live in the first house.

So, if the cello player is next to the Gameboy person, they must be in house 1 and 2.  And since the dog person can't be in the first house, they must be in the second house!


**Answer: (B) 2**
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the SUV.  Let's see...

* We know the gameboy is in the third house.
* The minivan is in the first house.
* The phone is right next to the SUV.
* The radio is somewhere after the gameboy.
* And the convertible isn't in the third house.

Hmm... that means the phone must be in the second house, and the SUV is in the third house!

So the answer is (B) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the person with the carnations lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see...

* We know tulips are in the third house.
* A computer is in the second house.
* The phone is right next to the TV, and the roses are right next to the carnations.
* Lilies are to the right of the phone, and daffodils are to the right of the radio.
* Daffodils aren't in the fourth house.

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the dog owner lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* The cricketer is in house number 2, and the golfer is in house number 4.
* The bird keeper is in house 1, and the fish person is also in house 2.
* The person with sandals lives in house 3, and the baseball player is somewhere after them.
* The cat lover is after the golfer, so they must be in house 5.

Hmm, let me think...  Since the person with running shoes isn't in house 4 or 5, and the sandals are in house 3, the running shoes must be in house 1 or 2.

Wait a minute! The loafers are next to the cricketer, so they must be in house 1. That means the running shoes are in house 2.

Okay, so we know a lot now!  

* House 1: Bird keeper, loafers
* House 2: Cricketer, fish enthusiast, running shoes
* House 3: Sandals
* House 4: Golfer
* House 5: Cat lover, baseball player

That leaves only one house for the dog owner... **House 3**!



So the answer is (C).
"
"Okay, so we have these two houses and two people.  They like different stuff, right?

We gotta figure out who ate pizza.

Here's what I think:

* The radio and truck people live next to each other.
* The radio is somewhere to the left of the pizza person.
* The root beer lover isn't in the first house.
* The grape eater is right next to the computer person.

Hmm... so if the radio and truck are together, and the radio is before the pizza, the pizza must be in the second house!

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we have these four houses and we gotta figure out who likes green.  

Let's see... the tea drinker is in the first house, and the pizza person is right next to them.  Then it says milk comes before spaghetti, and spaghetti comes before water. So it's gotta be like this:

House 1: Tea
House 2: Pizza
House 3: Spaghetti
House 4: Water

Oh, and the white and water people live next to each other, so white must be in house 3.

Now, the coffee person is somewhere before the yellow person, and green can't be in the first house.  

Hmmm... that means green has to be in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 4. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes red and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the dog person lives in the third house, and the person who likes water lives next to them.

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate grilled cheese.  

We know the soccer player is in the last house, house number 3. And the tulips aren't in the last house.

The golfer is right next to the basketball player, so they're in houses 1 and 2.

The lilies are right next to the grilled cheese, so the grilled cheese can't be in the first house.

That means the grilled cheese has to be in **house 2**.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate fried rice.  

Let's see... it says the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house. And the pianist is in the third house. Oh, and the person who ate fried rice is also in the third house!

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing running shoes.  Let's see...

Okay, I think I got it!  The computer person lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we know the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction fan.  That means the science fiction fan can't be in the house on the right. So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  

We know the pianist lives in the first house. And the person with horses can't be in the second house because the root beer lover has to be to their right. So the horse person must be in the first house too.

That means the dog person has to be in the second house!

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  Let's see...

There are clues about who eats what, what books they like, and what instrument they play.

* We know the stew person is in house number 2.
* And the pizza person is in house number 4.

Hmm, the percussionist has to be to the right of the science fiction fan, and the history buff is to the right of the percussionist.

Oh! That means the order has to be science fiction, then percussion, then history!

The guitarist is to the left of the violinist, and the violinist isn't in house 4.

Let me try drawing it out...

Okay, I think the percussionist is in house number **3**. 


(B)
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person with horses lives in.  Let's see...

* We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
* And the person with daffodils lives next to them, so they must be in the second house.
*  The horses have to be next to the daffodils, so they must be in the first house too!


So the answer is **(A) 1**. 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks milk.

We know the apple eater is in the last house, and the mango eater is right next to them in the middle house. That means the coffee person has to be in the first house, 'cause they're next to the milk drinker.

So the milk drinker is in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing boots.  Let's see...

* We know the science fiction fan lives in the middle house.
* And the carnations are in the first house.
* Oh, and the boots aren't in the last house.

Hmm...  Let me draw it out:

House 1: Carnations, ?, ?, ?
House 2: ?, ?, ?, Science Fiction
House 3: ?, ?, ?, ?

*  The person with the tulips is next to the person who likes red, and the loafers are right next to the red-lover too.

So maybe it looks like this:

House 1: Carnations, Loafers, ?, ?
House 2: Tulips, ?, Red, Science Fiction
House 3: ?, ?, ?, ?

* The white-lover is to the left of the tulips, so...

House 1: Carnations, Loafers, White, ?
House 2: Tulips, ?, Red, Science Fiction
House 3: ?, ?, ?, ?

* And the history buff is to the right of the tulips...

House 1: Carnations, Loafers, White, History
House 2: Tulips, Boots, Red, Science Fiction
House 3: ?, ?, ?, ?

So the boots are in house number **2 (C)**! 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and we need to figure out who has the roses.

* We know the water drinker is in the first house.
* The lilies are in the second house.
* The milk drinker is in the third house because the water house and the milk house have to be separated by one house.
* That means the tulips must be in the first house, since the lilies are in the second.

So, the only house left for the roses is the third house!

**Answer: (B)** 



"

"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the computer.  Let's see...

There are three houses, and each person has something different: a computer, a radio, or a TV. They also have different flowers and play different sports.

* The tennis player lives in a house to the left of the person with the TV.
* The golfer doesn't live in the middle house.
* The computer person and the tulip person live next to each other.
* The radio person lives to the right of the rose person.
* The radio person also lives to the right of the TV person.

Hmm, that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me try drawing it out...

Okay, so the radio has to be on the right side, and the TV has to be to the left of it. And the rose person is somewhere to the left of the radio.

The computer and tulip people are together, so they have to be in one of the houses next to each other.

I think the computer person must live in house number 3! 


**(A) 3**

* The swimmer is in house number 3.

* Daffodils are in house number 5.

Hmm, that's a good start!

*  The person with sandals is right next to the tulips.
*  The person with running shoes is right next to the daffodils.

So, sandals and tulips are buddies, and running shoes and daffodils are buddies too.

* The basketball player is right next to the guitarist, and the baseball player is right next to the basketball player.

Okay, so they're all hanging out together!

Let's see... there are two houses between the sandals and the cellist.

I think I need to draw a picture to keep track of all this...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person wearing sandals lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* House 1 is on the left and house 2 is on the right.
* One person has a dog, one has fish.
* One person ate stew, one ate grilled cheese.
* One person wears high heels, one wears sandals.

**Answer: (A) 1** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cat lover lives.  There are five houses, and each one has a person with a different favorite book, pet, color, and flower.

* Clue 7 says the fish person is in house number 3.

* Clue 8 says the tulips are in house 4, and they're right next to the romance books.

Clue 10 says the lilies are before the bird person.

Clue 1 and 12 say the blue lover and history lover are next to each other, and the mystery lover is before the blue lover.

Clue 4 says the white lover is next to the horse person.

(After some time spent working on the puzzle)

Okay, I think I got it! The apple eater lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza.  There are clues about shoes, food, books, and cars, and they all have to match up with the houses.

It's like a puzzle!

Let's see... the convertible is in the first house, and the boots aren't in the first house.  The running shoes are right next to the high heels, and the sandals are to the right of the boots.

Hmm, this is tricky.  We also know the stew eater is to the left of the sci-fi fan, and the truck is right next to the mystery reader.

Oh, and the SUV is next to the history buff, and the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the history buff.

The fantasy book person is next to the fried rice eater.

(I'd need to draw a chart and work through all the clues to get the answer, but I hope this helps!) 



"
"Okay, so we have these houses and people who like different books and play different instruments.  Let's see...

The mystery reader is in house number 4, and the sax player is also in house 4.  That means the person who plays the drums must be in house 3, and the romance book lover is in house 4.

The history book person is in house 2, and the guitar player is in house 5.  That leaves the fantasy book lover in house 5 too.

Since the sax and violin players are next to each other, the violin player must be in house 3!


So the answer is (C).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the Gameboy.  Let's see...

* We know the TV is in the last house, number 4.
* The loafers are in house number 2.
* The phone isn't in house 2.

Hmm, okay.

* The boots have to be somewhere before the loafers, so they must be in house 1.
* The radio and sandals have to be two houses apart, so the radio is in house 1 and the sandals are in house 3.

That leaves the phone in house 3 and the running shoes in house 4.

So, the Gameboy has to be in house 1!

**Answer: (C)**
"
"The person wearing high heels lives in house number **(B) 2**.

Clue number one says so! üë†üè†
"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  

We know one person likes history books and the other likes mysteries.  Also, one wears loafers and the other wears high heels.

The first clue says the loafer person doesn't live in the first house. That means they must live in the second house! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's look at them one by one.

Some clues tell us things are right next to each other, like the running shoes person and the gameboy person.  And the tulips are right before the pizza, and the pizza is right before the sandals.

We also know the running shoes aren't in the third house, and the boots are somewhere before the pizza.

If we keep going through all the clues like this, we can figure out where everything goes.

After looking at all the clues, I think the pizza person lives in house number 3.


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating apples.

We know the mango person is in house number 1.  And the sax player isn't in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

The roses are to the left of the lilies, so the roses are in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2.

That means the person eating apples has to be in house number 2!

So the answer is (B).

* The sedan and roses are buddies and live next door to each other.
* And the roses aren't in the middle house.

Hmm... if the roses aren't in the middle, and they have to be next to the sedan, then the sedan must be in the first house and the roses in the second! That means the SUV is in the first house too, and the lilies are in the second.

Since the tulips can't be in the last house, they must be in the first house.

That leaves the truck for the last house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is like a big detective game! We gotta use the clues to figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to write down all the clues and see how they fit together.  I'm gonna start by making a list of each house and then try to fill in the blanks using the clues.

Let me see... there are a lot of clues! I'll have to be careful and read them slowly.

...

(After some time spent working on the puzzle)

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who likes milk lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the basketball player lives. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are four houses, and each person is different.  We have clues about their favorite colors, sports, cars, and fruits.

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the convertible is in the last house.

We gotta use all the clues together, like puzzle pieces, to figure out where everyone else goes. It might take a bit of time, but we can do it!

Let me think...  

(I'd need to see the full list of clues to solve it completely, but I hope this helps get you started!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes blue.  Let's see...

* We know the green house is number 3.
* And the yellow house is right next to the green one, so that's house number 2.
* The stew person is to the left of the romance book lover, so stew must be in house 1 and romance is in house 2.
* The fantasy book person is to the right of the stew person, so they must be in house 3.

That means blue is the only one left, and they gotta be in house 1!

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives.  It's like a puzzle!

Let's see...

* We know the carnations are in the first house.
* And the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

Hmm, that's a good start.

* Oh! The tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other.

That means they're either in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

* But wait, the person with horses and the person who likes blue are also next to each other.

This is getting tricky!

*  I think we need to look at all the clues together to figure it out.

Let me think...

(Takes a moment to ponder)

I'm gonna need a little more time to solve this one. It's a tough puzzle! 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  

We know the first house has the person who likes fantasy books and plays the cello.

The person who likes green lives in the house before the person who likes red.

That means the second house must have the person who likes red and reads mystery books!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, I'm gonna start by writing down all the stuff they like:

* **Food:** Grilled cheese, stew, fried rice, pizza, spaghetti
* **Books:** Fantasy, romance, science fiction, mystery, history
* **Shoes:** Running shoes, high heels, sandals, boots, loafers
* **Sports:** Baseball, swimming, tennis, soccer, golf
* **Fruit:** Apples, oranges, mangos, kiwis, grapes

Now, let's see if those clues can help us put the pieces together...

* Clue 3 says the person eating mangos lives right next to the person eating oranges.

* Clue 8 says the baseball player lives right next to the grilled cheese eater.

* Clue 13 says the history book buff lives right next to the fried rice eater.

I'm gonna keep looking at the clues and see if I can figure out where the swimmer lives. This is gonna take some time! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the swimmer lives.

We know the golfer is in the middle house, house number 2. And the history buff is in the first house.

The clue about the swimmer and the science fiction fan means they can't be right next to each other.  Since the golfer is in the middle, the swimmer has to be in the last house, number 3!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, this puzzle seems tricky! Let's see...

We need to figure out who ate stew and what house they live in. There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can look for clues that tell us who lives next to who, and what they like to eat and stuff.

It's like a big puzzle, and we gotta put all the pieces together!

I'll try my best to figure it out!  



"
"This is a tricky one!  

Let's see... we know the person with sandals lives next to the person with horses. And the history book person is on the same side as the spaghetti eater.

Hmm, that means the fried rice person could be in either house! There's not enough info to know for sure. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the lilies.

We know the sedan is parked somewhere before the house with the lilies.  And the flutist doesn't live in the first house.

That means the lilies can't be in the first house, right? They gotta be in the second house!

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the romance book lover lives.  

Let's see... there are clues about houses, sports, flowers, and books.

* We know the rose bouquet is in the third house.
* And the carnations are in the fourth house.

Hmm, that's a good start!

* Oh, and the daffodils are in the second house because they have to be next to the roses.

* The mystery book reader is in the first house, and the swimmer is next to them.

* The fantasy book lover is right before the swimmer.

* That means the romance book lover has to be in the fourth house!

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the tulips are.  There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta be careful.

Hmm, I think the best way is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, who lives there, what they drink, what they have, and what instrument they play.

It's gonna take some time, but if we keep checking the clues and filling in the blanks, we'll get it!

(I'd need to see the clues again to actually solve it, but this is how I'd start!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the rose bouquet.  

Let's see... the minivan is in the last house, and the boots are right next to it. That means the boots are in the middle house.

The golfer is in the first house, and the running shoes aren't in the first house, so they must be in the last house.

The rose bouquet isn't in the middle house, and it can't be in the last house because the minivan is there. So, the rose bouquet has to be in the **first house**.

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about who lives next to who and what they like.  We need to use those clues to figure out where everyone is.

It's gonna take some thinking, but I bet we can do it!

(I'd need to see the clues to actually solve it, though!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person who likes white lives in.  

Let's see... it says the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house, and neither does the stew eater.  Also, the stew eater isn't in the fourth house.

And the red lover is right next to the stew eater!  Hmm...

Oh! The fried rice person lives in the third house. That helps!

Okay, I'm gonna try drawing it out.  

*House 1*  *House 2*  *House 3*  *House 4*  *House 5*

Let me think...  

...

Alright, I think I got it!  The person who likes white lives in **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the basketball player lives.  

We know the red lover is in house number 3, and the drummer is in house number 2.

The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player, so the basketball player can't be in house 3.

And the basketball player has to be to the right of the tennis player.

That means the basketball player must live in house number 2!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is like a detective game!  We gotta figure out who lives where based on the clues.

It's gonna take some time to figure out, but we can do it!  We need to look at each clue carefully and see how they fit together.

Let me see... I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

(Imagine a chart with the houses numbered 1-5 and spaces for flowers, instruments, drinks, and devices)

Okay, let's start with the clues and see what we can figure out! 



"
"This puzzle seems super hard!  

Okay, so there are five houses and each one has a person with different stuff. Like, one person has daffodils and another has a carnation thing.  

We gotta figure out where the minivan person lives. Hmm... let me see...

*  There are a lot of clues about who lives next to who.

* Some clues say who *doesn't* live in a certain house.

I'm gonna try drawing it out, like a chart with the houses in a row. Then I'll write down the clues next to the houses. Maybe that will help me see the pattern! 

This is gonna take some time...  



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tulips are!  

Let's see... the dog person is in house number 2, and the fish person is in house number 3.  

The clues say the tulips are next to the carnations, and those are next to the convertible.  And the truck is right before the computer.

Hmmm... if the minivan is to the right of the dog, it must be in house number 5.

That means the tulips have to be in house number 4!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the dog owner lives.  Let's see...

It says the basketball player is in the first house and they also play the saxophone.  

Then it says the person who eats pizza is right next to the dog owner.  

Hmm, let me think...

Oh! The answer is **(B) 3**.  The dog owner has to be in the last house! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the history buff is in house number 1. And the cat person can't be in house number 2.  

The person with high heels is in house number 1 because they're to the left of the daffodils, which are in house number 2.

Since the loafers are to the right of the computer, the computer must be in house 1 and the loafers in house 2.

That means the lilies have to be in house 1!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza! This is like a puzzle, right?

Let's see... there are five houses, and each one has a person with different stuff. Flowers, music, food, and what they ate for lunch.

We have a bunch of clues, like the apple eater is in house number 3, and the person who ate fried rice is right next door.  

We gotta use all the clues to figure out where the pizza person lives. It's like a detective game!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

...

(Imagine some scribbling and erasing here)

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The pizza person lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the cellist lives. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about colors, instruments, flowers, food, and books.  We need to match them up to the houses.

It's kinda like a detective game! We gotta look for clues that connect things.

*  The history buff is in house number 2.
* The fantasy book lover is in house number 4.

Hmm, that's a good start!

Let me see... there are a bunch of clues about where things are in relation to each other. Like, the rose bouquet is next to the yellow lover, and the blue lover is a few houses away from the green lover.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House 1* | *House 2* | *House 3* | *House 4*
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
        | History  |         | Fantasy

Okay, now I gotta figure out where the rest of the stuff goes. This is gonna take some thinking!

...

(After some more thinking and scribbling)

Aha! I think I got it! The cellist lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the pianist lives.  

Let's see... the clues say the pianist lives next to the kiwi eater. And the violinist is somewhere to the left of the kiwi eater.  Also, the grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater.

That means the pianist can't be in house number 3, 'cause there wouldn't be room for the kiwi eater and the grape eater.

So, the pianist must be in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we know the person in house number 1 eats kiwis.  And the person who likes fantasy books doesn't live there. That means the fantasy book person must live in house number 2!

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"The person who likes red lives in house number **(D) 3**. 

I know this because the clues tell us that! Clue number 8 says the person who likes red lives in the third house.  



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.  One's a pianist and one plays the cello. One loves root beer and the other likes tea.

We know the root beer person doesn't live in house number 2. That means they gotta be in house number 1!

And since the pianist lives right next to the cello player, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cello player is in house 2.


So the answer is (A) 1.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the lilies are.  Let's see...

* We know carnations are in the last house, house number 5.
* And boots are right next to the carnations, so they must be in house 4.

*  The tulips are to the left of the loafers, and the daffodils are to the left of the tulips.

* Oh, and the running shoes are next to the daffodils!

*  Let me try drawing it out...

*  Okay, so it looks like the lilies have to be in house number 1! 


**Answer: (A)** 

"
"This puzzle is like a detective game! We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some thinking, but we can do it! Let's see... there are lots of clues about colors, sports, and stuff. We need to see how they all fit together.

Hmm, I'm gonna need to draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I'm starting to get it!  We gotta look for clues that tell us exactly where someone lives, like ""two houses between blue and apples.""

Let me see... *continues to work on the puzzle*



I'll let you know when I figure out where the pianist lives!
"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and we gotta figure out who ate what.

Let's see...

* We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
* And the person who likes green lives in the second house.
* Oh, and the person with high heels doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm...

* The boots are next to the high heels, so the boots must be in the first house and the high heels in the second.
* The stew is somewhere after the boots, so it must be in the last house.

That leaves fried rice for the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we have these houses and people, and we gotta figure out who has the lilies.

Let's see... the rose person is in house number 2. And the sci-fi fan is next to them, so they must be in house 3.

The romance person is right next to the tulips, so the tulips are in house 4 and the romance person is in house 3.

That means the carnations have to be in house 2.

So, by process of elimination, the lilies must be in house 1!

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we know the science fiction fan lives in house number 1.  And the coffee drinker is in the house to the left of the person with sandals.  That means the coffee drinker is in house 1 too!  That leaves house number 2 for the romance book lover.

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"Okay, so we know the percussionist lives in the house to the left of the person with the radio. That means the percussionist is in house number 1, and the radio is in house number 2.  Since they each have a different thing, the person in house 1 must have the phone!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes yellow.

We know the convertible is in the middle house, house number 2.

Then it says the white and sedan people have one house between them. So they can't be in the first and last houses, they gotta be in the first and last houses.

And the yellow person lives right next to the sedan person.

So, the yellow person has to be in the first house!

Answer: (A) 1 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... we need to find out where the person with horses lives.  There are a bunch of clues about shoes, cars, and pets.

Hmm, I think we should write down the clues and see if we can match them up.

* The person with running shoes lives in the first house.
* The person with a sedan lives in the third house.
* The dog owner doesn't live in the third house.
* The person with sandals lives somewhere before the bird keeper.
* There are two houses between the running shoes and the bird keeper.
* The person with high heels doesn't live in the fourth house.
* The fish person lives somewhere after the SUV person.
* The fish person doesn't live in the third house.
* The person with high heels lives right before the truck person.
* The person with loafers doesn't live in the fifth house.
* The fish person doesn't live in the fifth house.
* The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.
* The horse person lives somewhere after the minivan person.

This is a lot to keep track of!  I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to help me.

Okay, I think I'm starting to see a pattern...

...

(After some more work, you'd continue to analyze the clues and fill in the chart until you could determine the answer.)

...

I got it! The horse person lives in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... it says the convertible is in the first house and the bird keeper is also in the first house.  And the loafers are in the second house.  Hmm, that means the person with the kiwis must be in the third house because they're next to the loafers.

We gotta keep going like this, using the clues to figure out where everything else goes. It's like a big matching game!

I'll keep working on it and see if I can find out where the truck is. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate the grilled cheese.

We know the fried rice person lives in the middle house (house number 2) because it says so right in the clues! And they also like fantasy books.

The spaghetti eater is in the first house because they're to the left of the fried rice person.

That means the grilled cheese person has to be in the last house, number 3!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"I think the person with the carnations lives in house number 1.  The clue says they live to the left of the person with the dog, and house 1 is on the left! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person wearing high heels lives in.

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 2.  And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  

Since the kiwi eater is in house 2, the high heel wearer must be in house 2 too!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They each have different stuff, like a TV or a phone, and they like different things, like kiwis or grapes.

Here's what we know:

* The high heel person lives to the left of the sandal person.
* The grape person and the sandal person live right next to each other.
* The tea drinker lives to the left of the TV person.

Let's see... if the high heel person is to the left of the sandal person, and the grape person is next to the sandal person, then it has to go: high heels, grapes, sandals.

That means the TV person can't be in the first house because the tea drinker has to be to their left. So the TV person must be in the second house.

That leaves the first house for the kiwi eater!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the guitarist lives.

We know the tea drinker is in the first house.  And the violinist can't be in the last house.

The water drinker has to be to the right of the cellist, so they can't be in the first house either.

Since the violinist and guitarist have to have a house between them, and the violinist can't be last, the violinist must be in the first house and the guitarist must be in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the water drinker lives in.  

Let's see... the person in the third house wears sandals and likes milk.  And the water drinker lives right next to the sandal person.  

That means the water drinker must live in house number 4!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate spaghetti!  

Let's see... there are five houses, and each person has something different for lunch and a different gadget.

We know pizza is in house number 4.  And the computer person doesn't live there, and neither does the radio person.

The clues say the grilled cheese person is right next to the spaghetti person. And the radio person is one house away from the grilled cheese person.

Hmm... that means the spaghetti person can't be in house 1 or 5.

Let's try drawing it out...

Okay, I think the spaghetti person is in house 3! 


**Answer: (E)**
"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

I'd start by writing down all the clues and then try to see if any of them tell us something for sure. Like, clue 16 says the tennis player is in house number 1. That's a good start!

Then we can look for clues that tell us who's next to who, like clue 3.

It's gonna take some time, but I bet we can crack this!  

Let me know if you want to work on it together. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people. One plays guitar and the other plays drums. One had pizza and one had grilled cheese. One has a dog and one has a bird.

The clues tell us the grilled cheese person lives to the right of the bird person, and the drummer doesn't live in the second house.

That means the drummer must live in the first house, right? Because if they lived in the second house, the grilled cheese person would have to be to their right, and there's no more house!

So, if the drummer is in the first house, the guitar player is in the second house. And since the grilled cheese person is to the right of the bird person, the bird person must be in the first house and the grilled cheese person in the second.

That means the pizza person must be in the first house!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"The bird keeper lives in house number **(A) 3**.  Clue number 2 says so! üê¶üè† 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's the science fiction fan! This is like a puzzle, right?

Let's see... we know the cat lover is in the first house. And a bunch of stuff can't be in the second house.  

We also know the fish person is to the right of the banana eater, and the flute player is to the right of the fish person.  

Hmm, this is tricky. I'd have to draw it out on paper to keep track of everything.  

I'm gonna need a little more time to think about this one! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating kiwis.  Let's see...

* We know the grape person is in house number 2.

* The red lover lives to the right of the kiwi person.

* Green and red are neighbors, and green is to the left of yellow.

* White is one house away from red, and one house away from the banana person.

Hmm... so it's gotta be like this:

Kiwi - Green - Red - White - Banana

That means the kiwi person is in house number 1!

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate the stew.

We know the person with running shoes is to the right of the orange eater. And the mystery book reader lives next to the cat lover.  Plus, the mystery book reader and stew eater are right next to each other.

Since the running shoes person has to be to the right of the orange eater, the stew eater can't be in house number 2. That means the stew eater must be in **house number 1**.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks milk.  Let's see...

* We know the person in the middle house drinks water.
* The first house guy likes root beer.
* The daffodils are next to the phone, so the daffodils are in the middle house and the phone is in the last house.
* The TV isn't in the middle house, and it's gotta be to the right of the tulips. So the tulips are in the first house and the TV is in the last house.

That means the milk has to be in the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the computer.  Let's see...

It says the person with loafers lives in the first house.  And the boots guy doesn't live in the last house.  

Hmm, this is kinda tricky.  I'm gonna try drawing it out.

*House 1*  Loafers  
*House 2* 
*House 3*

Okay, so the phone person is somewhere to the left of the mango eater.  And the grape person is right next to the water drinker.

This is like a puzzle! I gotta keep going...

(Continues to work through the clues)



Let me know if you want me to keep trying! This is kinda fun.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the horses!

Let's see...

* We know the golfer doesn't live in the last house, and neither does the cricketer.
* The golfer and baseball player live next to each other.
* The person with carnations lives to the left of the baseball player, and next to the horse person.
* Roses are to the left of daffodils.

Hmm... I think I got it!

If the golfer is in the middle house, the baseball player is next to them in the last house. That means the carnations and horses must be in the middle and last house too.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. The horse person lives in house number 3! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the truck is in.  

Here's what we know:

* The first house has the person eating oranges.
* The last house has the person with horses.
* The truck has to be next to the convertible.

Since the horses are in the last house, the convertible can't be there. That means the truck has to be in the second house!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's look at them one by one.

It says the percussionist lives to the left of the stew eater, and to the right of the mystery book reader.  It also says the guitarist is right next to the percussionist.

Hmm, that means they have to be in a row like this:

Guitarist - Percussionist - Stew Eater

We also know the science fiction fan is somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the mystery reader is right next to the romance reader.

Let's see... if we put the mystery reader and romance reader together, and the science fiction fan to the left of the percussionist, it could look like this:

Science Fiction - Guitarist - Percussionist - Stew Eater - Romance Reader

But wait! The pizza eater is two houses away from the saxophonist.  And the fantasy book lover is to the left of the flutist.

This is getting tricky! I need to think about where those guys fit in...

Okay, I think I got it!

The percussionist lives in house number **4**. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"This puzzle is like a big detective game!  We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to look at all the clues and see how they fit together.  

Let me see... I'll try to keep track of everything in a chart.

*House Number* | *Car* | *Book* | *Fruit* | *Color* | *Lunch*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |          |          |          |          |

5        |          |          |          |          |          

Okay, I'm gonna start filling this in with the clues.  It's like a puzzle, one clue helps us figure out the next!

(I'll need some time to work on this, but I'll let you know when I figure out where the mango eater lives!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the saxophonist lives. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are five houses, and everyone has a favorite color, plays an instrument, and has a gadget.  We have a bunch of clues to help us.

I like to start by looking for clues that tell us exactly where someone is.  Clue 7 says the person who likes green lives in house number 3, and clue 10 says the radio is also in house 3.

Then, clue 1 says the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other.  And clue 8 says the percussionist is right next to the person who likes white.

We can keep going like this, using the clues to figure out who lives where. It's like a detective game!

After looking at all the clues, I figured out that the saxophonist lives in house number 2.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we have these two houses and two people.  We gotta figure out who has the horses.

It says the cellist is somewhere before the mystery book reader, and the history buff is before the cat lover.  So it could be like this:

Cellist - Mystery Reader - History Buff - Cat Lover

Or maybe:

Cellist - History Buff - Mystery Reader - Cat Lover

And the root beer drinker and the guitarist are right next to each other.  They could fit in either of those lineups.

But the thing is, we don't know where the horse person goes!  It could be either house. 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and we need to figure out who has the tulips.

* We know the person with the carnations lives to the right of the bird person.
* The dog person can't be in the middle house.
* And the tulips are to the right of the dog person.

Hmm... so if the dog person isn't in the middle, they must be in the first house. That means the tulips can't be in the first house either, they have to be in the second or third.

Since the carnations are to the right of the bird person, the bird person can't be in the last house. So the bird person must be in the first house with the dog person.

That means the tulips must be in the second house!


**Answer: (B)**
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person wearing loafers lives in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's try to use them like puzzle pieces.

It's kinda like a big matching game! We know stuff about each house, like what kind of fruit they're eating or what sport they play.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  It might take a while to figure it out, but we can do it!

(The student would then likely start drawing a simple chart with the house numbers and categories, trying to fill it in based on the clues.) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the mango person lives in house number 1.  And the horses can't be in houses 1 or 2.  

The banana person is right next to the dog person, so they can't be in the last house. That means the banana person must be in house 2 and the dog person in house 3.

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other, and the only spots left are houses 3 and 4. Since the dog person is in house 3, the bird person must be in house 4!

So the answer is (B) 4. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes romance books.

We know the mystery person is in the first house.  And the bird person is right next to the history person.  Oh, and the romance person and the horse person can't be in the last house.

That means the romance person has to be in the second house! 


Answer: (B) 2
"
"Okay, so the coffee drinker lives in house number 2. That's clue number one! 

The answer is (D) 2.
"
"The person eating the banana lives in house number 3. Clue number 12 tells us that! üçåüè†  



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the carnations.  There are three houses, and each one has a different person with different stuff.

Let's see... the clues tell us a bunch of things, like who eats what and what kind of shoes they wear.  We gotta use all the clues to figure it out.

After looking at all the clues, I think the person with the carnations lives in **house 1**. 


So the answer is (A).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  There are these clues about people in houses and what they have.

Let's see... the phone person is somewhere before the minivan person. And the truck and gameboy people live right next to each other.  Oh, and the minivan and cellist are neighbors too!

Hmm, the minivan is to the right of the truck, and the flutist is to the left of the minivan.  

Oh! And the boots person is to the right of the percussionist.

I think I got it!  The percussionist must live in **House 1**. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the apple eater lives in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the daffodils are in house number 2, and the grapes are in house number 5.
* Apples are in house number 4.

That's easy! 

So the answer is **(A) 4**.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks coffee and what house they live in.

Let's see... the lilies are in the middle house, house number 2.  And the person with the roses is right next to the coffee drinker.  The SUV is also right next to the coffee drinker.

Since the lilies are in the middle, the coffee drinker has to be in house number 3!


So the answer is (C) 3.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drives the truck.  Let's see...

There are three houses, and each person is different. One drives a convertible, one a minivan, and one a truck. They also ate different stuff for lunch and like different colors.

We have some clues:

1. The blue lover lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
2. The stew eater lives somewhere to the left of the lilies.
3. The roses are right next to the truck.
4. The minivan is right next to the stew eater.
5. The red lover doesn't live in the first house.
6. The minivan is right next to the daffodils.

Hmm... let me draw it out:

House 1 | House 2 | House 3
------- | -------- | --------

Okay, so clue 4 and 6 tell us the minivan is in the first house, then stew, then daffodils.

House 1 | House 2 | House 3
------- | -------- | --------
Minivan | Stew     | Daffodils

Clue 3 says roses are next to the truck, so the truck must be in the last house!

House 1 | House 2 | House 3
------- | -------- | --------
Minivan | Roses    | Truck

Now, clue 1 says blue is next to spaghetti, so they must be in houses 2 and 3.

House 1 | House 2 | House 3
------- | -------- | --------
Minivan | Spaghetti| Truck

And clue 5 says red isn't in the first house, so red must be in house 3.

House 1 | House 2 | House 3
------- | -------- | --------
Minivan | Spaghetti| Truck

So the truck is in **House 3 (A)**!
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the sedan is in. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about who lives where, what they like, and what they do.  We need to use all the clues together to find the sedan.

It might take a bit of time to figure it out, but we can do it!  

(I'd need to see all the clues to actually solve it, though!) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the phone.  

Let's see... the person with the gameboy is in the last house, and the red-lover is in the middle house.  

The grapes person is to the right of the red person, so they must be in the last house too.

The white-lover is to the left of the grapes person, so they gotta be in the first house.

The phone person is right next to the running shoes person, and since the last house is full, the phone must be in the first house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"The bird keeper lives in house number **(C) 2**.  The puzzle says so right in the first clue! üê¶üè† 



"
"Okay, so we have these two houses and we gotta figure out who eats mangos.

Let's see... the saxophonist is in house number 1, and they live right next to the golfer.  Also, the grape eater lives next to both the tea drinker and the baseball player.

That means house 1 must have the saxophonist, golfer, tea drinker, and grapes.  That leaves house 2 for the mango eater and the science fiction book lover!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  

Let's see... it's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

I'd start by writing down all the clues. Then maybe draw five boxes for the houses and try to fill them in.  

It says the person with apples is in the fourth house, and the one with running shoes is in the first. That's a good start!

Then we gotta look for clues that tell us who's next to who. Like, the green person is next to the blue person, and the oranges person is to the right of green.

It's gonna take some time, but if we go clue by clue, we can figure it out! 



"
"The person wearing boots lives in house number **(A) 1**.  

Clue number 3 tells us that! üë†üè†
"
"This puzzle is like a detective game! We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

It's gonna take some time to figure out, but we can do it!  We need to look at all the clues and see how they fit together.

Let me see...  

(Starts scribbling on a piece of paper, muttering to themselves)

Hmmm...  

Okay, I think the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... we have five houses and we need to find out who likes green.  They gave us a bunch of clues about drinks, flowers, food, and colors.

I'm gonna try writing it all down to keep track.

* House 1: Tea drinker
* House 2: Roses and Lilies

Hmm, I need to think about the other clues and see if I can figure out where everything else goes. This is gonna take some time! 

(Continues to work on the puzzle) 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... we need to find out who ate fried rice and what house they live in.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I'm gonna try writing down the stuff we know about each house.

House 1: We know they have tulips and ate spaghetti.

Now we gotta use the other clues to see if we can figure out more.  

Hmmm... this is gonna take some thinking! 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They like different stuff, right?

We gotta figure out who likes fantasy books.

Let's see... the clues say the grape eater is next to the truck driver, and the yellow lover is also next to the truck driver. So it's gotta be like this: Yellow lover - Grapes - Truck driver.

Then it says the boots person is next to the mystery reader.

So maybe House 1 is Yellow lover - Grapes - Truck driver and House 2 is Boots - Mystery reader.

That means the fantasy reader has to be in House 1!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we gotta figure out where the fried rice eater lives.

It says the minivan and fried rice are right next to each other.  And the minivan is before the mystery reader and the truck.  Hmm... I think we need to draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

I'm gonna try drawing five boxes for the houses and write down clues as I go. This might take a while! 

(The solver would then proceed to draw a chart and work through the clues, eventually arriving at the answer.)

...

Okay, I think I got it! The fried rice eater lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza and what house they live in.  

Let's see... it says the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. And the golfer lives in the last house. Oh, and the pizza person is right next to the basketball player.

Hmm, this is kinda tricky. I'm gonna try drawing it out.

* House 1: Spaghetti
* House 4: Golfer

Okay, so pizza and basketball are together.  Let me think...

* House 2: Pizza
* House 3: Basketball

There we go!

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and three people. Each person plays a different instrument and a different sport.

We know the basketball player and the violinist are the same person because they both live in the middle house.

The cellist has to live to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't be in the last house.

That means the cricketer must be in the first house, the basketball player/violinist is in the middle house, and the cellist is in the last house.

That leaves the first house for the soccer player!

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tea drinker lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* The mystery person and the water drinker are in the last house.
* The history book person is right before the lilies.
* The white lover isn't in the third house.
* The daffodils aren't in the first house.
* The carnations aren't in the last house.
* The carnations are to the right of the tea drinker.
* The tea drinker is to the right of the red lover.
* The fantasy book person and the mystery person are next to each other.
* The green lover is to the left of the coffee drinker.

Hmm, that's a lot!  

Let's see... if the mystery person is last, and the fantasy person is next to them, then the fantasy person must be in the third house.  And the history person is in the third house too, so the lilies must be last.

The carnations have to be to the right of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker can't be last.  And the tea drinker is to the right of the red lover, so the tea drinker must be first!

So the answer is (A) 4. 



"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the fish person lives.  There are clues about who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, I'd start by writing down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, we know the coffee drinker is in house number 4 and they also play the flute and have horses!

Then we can look for clues that tell us who's next to who.  Like, the dog person and the root beer lover are neighbors.

I bet if we keep looking at the clues and matching them up, we can figure out where the fish person lives.

It might take a little while, but we can do it! 



"
"Okay, so we know the pianist lives in house number 2.  And the person with the daffodils lives right next to the pianist.  That means the daffodils must be in house number 1!

Answer: (A) 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the sedan is parked. This is like a puzzle!

Let's see... the person with oranges lives in the first house, and the banana guy is in the fourth house. Oh, and the SUV is also in the fourth house.

The tulips are somewhere before the convertible, and the apples are right next to the daffodils, who are right next to the minivan.  The sedan is somewhere after the carnations.

Hmm... this is tricky. I'm gonna draw some houses and write stuff down to keep track.

*House 1: Oranges*
*House 4: Banana, SUV*

Okay, gotta keep going...  

(Continues to work through the clues, drawing and writing)

...Aha! I got it! The sedan is in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks root beer.

We know the soccer player is in house number 2.  And the person who likes blue is right next to the root beer lover.  

Since the soccer player is in house 2, the blue lover must be in house 1, and the root beer lover is in house 2!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but we can figure it out!

Let's see... it says there are five houses and each person has a sport, a favorite flower, and a favorite color.  We gotta use the clues to figure out who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues!  I'm gonna write them down and try to see if any of them help me figure out where the swimmer lives.

*  The soccer player doesn't live in the fourth house.
* The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
* The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
* The soccer player doesn't live in the first house.
* The person who has lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.

* The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.
* The person who has carnations lives somewhere to the right of the person who has tulips.
* The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Okay, let me think...  

(After some time thinking and scribbling on paper)

I think the swimmer lives in house number **(C) 3**! 



"
"Okay, so we know the violinist lives in house number 1.  And the person with the computer is in the same house as the violinist. That means the bird person has to be in house number 2, right?

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the computer is. This is like a big puzzle!

Let's see... there are clues about who lives in each house and what they have.  We know the rose bouquet is in the first house and the boots are in the second. Pizza is in the fourth house.

We also know the TV is in the third house.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about who likes what kind of books and what they ate for lunch. Maybe we can use those to figure out where the computer is.

Let me think...

Okay, I think the computer is in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing running shoes.  Let's see...

* We know the person in the middle house wears boots.
* The person with the high heels is next to the dog person.
* The last house has a sedan.
* The first house has a cat person.

Hmmm... so the cat person can't have the high heels or the boots. And the dog person can't be in the last house because the last house has a sedan.

That means the person with the high heels must be in the first house, and the dog person is in the middle house!

Since the last house has a sedan, the running shoes must be there!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating apples and what house they live in.  

Let's see...

* We know the tea drinker is in house number 3.
* And the person with carnations is in house 1, and they're wearing running shoes.
* The tulips are in house 2.

Hmm, this is tricky!  Let me think...

* Oh! The person who likes milk and the apple eater are neighbors.

I'm gonna need to think about this some more...  Can you give me another clue? 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and three people who like different kinds of books and have different stuff.

* We know the mystery book person lives in the first house.
* That means the history book person is in the second house because they live right next to the mystery book person.
* The mystery book person also lives right next to the TV person, so the TV person is in the second house too.
* The computer person has to be in the last house because the computer person is to the right of the phone person.

That leaves the science fiction person in the second house!

So the answer is (C) 2.
