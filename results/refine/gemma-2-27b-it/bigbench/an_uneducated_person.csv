"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And each one has a different flower and a different music thing.

The flutist is in the second house, that's easy. And the tulips gotta be next to the guitar player.  

Hmm, the lilies are next to the carnations, and the pianist is somewhere near the flutist.

Let me see... if the pianist is in the first house, there's no room for the tulips to be next to the guitar player. So the pianist must be in the third house! That means the tulips gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all like different stuff, like fruits and colors and stuff.

Let's see... the green lover is in the first house, and they're eatin' kiwis.  And the guy with the gameboy, he's gotta be next to the blue lover.

Hmm... the cellist is one house away from the gameboy guy.  

So, the cellist must be in the last house!

**(C)** 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff.  

You wanna know who likes green?  Hmm, lemme see...

*Looks at the clues, squints, scratches head*

This is a real head-scratcher!  Lotsa numbers and stuff.

*Mumbles to self*

Red's in the second house... kiwis are in the last one...

*Looks up suddenly*

Hold on, I think I got it!  

*Points to a number*

It's gotta be house number **(C) 3**! 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And everyone's got their own thing goin' on - what they drink, what they eat, what shoes they wear, the whole deal.

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

* The guy in the first house, he's eatin' apples. That's a good start.
* And the third house, that's where the high heels are. Fancy!

Now, lemme think... trucks, SUVs, convertibles... it's all mixin' up in my head.

Hold on, lemme grab a pencil and paper...

*scratches head and mutters*

...

Alright, I think I got it!

The tea drinker is in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Well, shoot, that's easy!  The fella who ate the grilled cheese lives in house number **(A) 5**.  It says so right there in the clues! 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it. They all like different sports and fruits and stuff.

Let's see... the soccer guy lives somewhere before the one eatin' oranges. And the swimmer and the daffodil fella are neighbors. Oh, and the tulips are somewhere after the mango guy.

Hmm... I think the daffodil guy must be in house number **(C) 3**.  That's where it all seems to fit, ya know? 



"
"Hmm, this is a real head-scratcher!  Let's see...

They got three houses in a row, and each one's got a different fella livin' in it.  One plays music, one's got fancy flowers, and they all like different books.

Now, lemme see... the spaghetti guy don't live in the middle house. And the fried rice fella lives to the right of the one who bangs on things.  

Oh, and the daffodils are somewhere before the banger too.

Gosh, this is tricky!  I'm gonna need to think real hard about this one...

(C) 1 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a different fella livin' in it. They all got different stuff, like one's got a game thing, another's got a phone, and the last one's got a computer.  

They also got different flowers, like carnations, lilies, and roses. And they all play different music things, like the flute, drums, and that cello thingy.

Some like horses, some like birds, and one's got fish. And they all read different books, like history, love stories, and mysteries.

It says the bird guy don't live in the first or last house, so he must be in the middle one. And the mystery reader is in the middle house too.

The history guy is next to the lilies, so he must be in the first house.

And the game thing is next to the roses, so that's gotta be the last house.

So the gameboy guy is in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda fruit, pet, thingy they use, and flowers.  

That's a lot to keep track of!  

Lemme see...  

* The horses are in the third house, that's for sure.

* And the dog person is right next to the flowers, lilies I think?

* Oh, and the grapes gotta be after the horses.

Hmm, this is tricky.  I'm gonna need to draw this out...

*scribbles on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!

The phone's gotta be in house number... **(D) 4** 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The guy in the first house has the fancy car, right? And the history book fella is next to him. So the boots guy gotta be in the other house. That means the sandals guy is in the first house.

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And each one has a person who likes different books and plays a sport.  

The golfer's in the first house, that's easy. And the swimmer's gotta be next to the romance reader, but not in the third house. So the swimmer's in the second house, and the romance reader's in the third.

The mystery reader's gotta be next to the history buff, and the basketball player can't be in the last house.  

Hmmm... that means the basketball player's gotta be in the third house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3.  That's what the paper says! 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a fella with somethin' different - a phone, a computer thingy, or one of them gameboy thingamajigs. And they each like a color, yellow, blue, or green.

Hmm, let me see... the green guy lives next to the gameboy fella, and the gameboy fella is next to the computer guy.  And the yellow fella ain't in the middle house.

So, if the green guy is in the first house, the gameboy fella is in the second, and the computer guy is in the third house.

That means the computer guy is in house **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one different.  

One fella likes red, another white, another green, and the last one yellow.  Then there's the drinks - water, root beer, tea, and coffee. And they all read different books - mystery, history, romance, and sci-fi.

Now, lemme see...

* The root beer guy's in the third house, and the red guy's there too.
* Coffee's gotta be somewhere after the green guy.
* History guy ain't in the last house, and romance ain't in the first.

Hmm...  

Thinkin'... thinkin'...

Alright, I got it! Coffee's gotta be in the last house!


**(B)** 

"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One guy likes mysteries, the other likes those fantasy books.  One eats pizza, one eats spaghetti. One's got a phone, one's got a radio. One likes green, one likes yellow. And one's got a cat, one's got a fish.

Hmm... the guy with the green stuff is next to the radio guy. And the fantasy guy is in the first house.  The pizza guy ain't in the first house.

So, if the fantasy guy is in the first house, and the pizza guy ain't, the pizza guy must be in the second house.  And if the green guy is next to the radio guy, the green guy must be in the first house and the radio guy in the second.

That means the cat guy must be in the first house!

(A) 1 



"
"Gosh, that's a lot of stuff to keep track of!  Lemme see...  

They said the dog person is in the second house, right? And the red lover is next to 'em. So that's the red lover in house number three.  

Now, where's that water drinker... hmm...  

*scratches head*

This is harder than it looks! 



"
"That's easy! The kiwi eater is in house number **(A) 1**.  Clue number 8 says so plain as day! 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella eatin' different stuff and havin' different flowers.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

* The fella with the roses is right next to the one eatin' grilled cheese.
* And the guy eatin' oranges is somewhere before the apple guy.

Hmm...  Lotsa rules about who's next to who.  

Let me think...

(After some scribbling and muttering)

I think the stew guy is in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it. One likes horses, one likes cats, one likes dogs, and one likes fishy things. And they all got different flowers too.

Well, that cat person, they're in the first house, that's for sure. And the tulip person is right next to the dog person.  

Hmm, the fishy person... lemme see...  It's gotta be the last house! 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The phone guy's in the first house, right? And the boot wearin' fella ain't in the second house, so he must be in the first one too.  That means the high heel wearer's gotta be in the second house.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it. They all got different shoes and stuff, and they like different colors and eat different fruits.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

* One guy eats grilled cheese, and he's gotta be next to the fella with the computer.
* And the grilled cheese guy can't be in the last house.
* The apple guy ain't in the first house neither.

Hmm... this is tough.

* The grape guy is somewhere to the right of the boots guy.
* And the blue guy's gotta be one house away from the phone guy.

Let me think...

* The loafers guy ain't in the last house.
* The pizza guy ain't in the middle house.
* The mango guy is right next to the yellow guy.

Okay, I think I got it!  The green guy's gotta be in the **(C) 3rd house**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one has a fella in it who likes different stuff. One's a swimmer, one plays ball, one's got a bird, and so on.

It says the baseball guy's in the second house. And the basketball fella ain't in the first house, but he's before the swimmer. So the basketball guy must be in the third house, and the swimmer's in the last one.

Then it says the tennis guy is right next to the cat guy.  And the bird guy ain't in the first or third house.

Hmmm... that means the bird guy's gotta be in the last house!


So the answer is **(C) 4**. 

"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one different.  

You wanna know where the soccer player is? Hmm... lemme see...

It's like a puzzle, gotta figure it out step by step.  

(B) 3 



"
"That's easy! It says right there in the clues that the grilled cheese eater is in the first house. So the answer is (E) 1. 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a different person doin' different stuff.  

Let's see... one plays music, one's got fancy shoes, and one's eatin' fruit.  

Hmm... it says the piano player ain't in the first house. And the orange eater is somewhere after the kiwi eater.

Oh, and the high heel wearer and the piano player are next to each other!

I think the TV is in the last house.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda car and stuff.  

This is gonna take some thinkin'... lemme see...

* House number 3, that's where the milk drinker is. And they gotta be next to the banana guy.

*  And the water fella's gotta be next to the yellow car guy.

* Oh, and the apple guy's in house number 3 too!

*  Hmm... this is tricky...

*  Wait a minute! The milk guy is in house 3, and the SUV guy is somewhere to the right of him.

*  I think... I think the sedan guy is in house number... 4!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the kiwi guy's in the first house, right? And the truck ain't in the last house, and neither is the SUV.  Plus, the truck ain't in the first house neither.  

That means the truck's gotta be in the middle house, and the SUV's gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

House number three, that's where the fried rice guy is. And the spaghetti fella is right next to him, so that's house number two.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each with their own ride and favorite color and shoes.  

Let's see...  

* The blue-lovin' fella's in the last house, number 5.
* And the one who likes white, he's in house number 4.

Now, lemme think... the truck guy's gotta be next to the sandals fella, and the loafers guy's gotta be somewhere before the truck.  

Hmm...  that means the boots guy's gotta be before the loafers, right?

So, I'm thinkin' the boots guy's in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"The history book buff lives in house number 1.  That's what it says right there in the clues! 



"
"Gosh, that's a lot of words!  

Lemme see... five houses, five folks, and they all like different stuff.  

Hmm, I'm not so good with all these fancy words, but maybe if you tell me what each person likes, I can figure out where the apple eater lives.  Just tell me straight up, like ""The guy who plays the trumpet eats oranges"" or somethin'. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower, a color, shoes, and a book.  

* House number two's got daffodils, and they like history books.
* The last house, number three, has someone wearin' loafers.

Hmm... the yellow-lovin' person can't be in the first or last house. And the blue-lovin' person's gotta be to the right of whoever wears high heels.

Let's see... if the yellow person's in the middle, and the history buff's there too, then the boots gotta be in the first house.

That means the green-lovin' person's gotta be in the first house too!

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Well, shoot, that's easy!  The fella in the runnin' shoes is in house number **(B) 1**.  It says so right there in the first clue! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella with a different pet and a different car.

The cricket guy's in the first house, that's for sure. And the truck driver's gotta be after the basketball fella.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the horse guy's gotta be next to the car fella, but not the truck fella.

So, the basketball fella's gotta be in the middle house, right?

(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of stuff to keep track of.  

Let me see... houses in a row, folks with different things...  

I'm gonna need to draw this out.  

*grabs a napkin and starts scribbling*

Okay, so we got houses 1 through 5.  And they got all these things, like TVs and pets and flowers...

*mumbles to self while drawing*

This is gonna take a while... 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one different.  Shoes, cars, what they ate, what they drink... it's a lot to keep track of!

Lemme see...  

*  The root beer guy and the one who ate fried rice are neighbors.
*  The fella in loafers is right next to the grilled cheese eater.
*  High heels ain't in the last house.
*  Milk drinker's in the third house.
*  Root beer guy's to the left of the SUV.
*  Two houses between the sedan and the water drinker.
*  Running shoes are in the second house.
*  Convertible's left of the water drinker.
*  Spaghetti eater ain't in the first house.

Whew! That's a lot.  

Now, where's that sedan?  Gotta think... think...

(After some pondering)

I think the sedan's in house number **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one has a fella in it who likes different stuff. One drinks water, one likes tea, one's a milk drinker, and the last one likes root beer. They also got different shoes, play different music things, and ate different stuff for lunch.

There's a bunch of clues, but the one that sticks out is that the fella who plays the cello is right next to the tea drinker.  And the tea drinker's in the last house. So the cello player must be in the third house!

(C) 3 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

Four houses in a row, huh? And they all got different stuff goin' on inside.  

*One guy's gotta be a swimmer, another plays soccer, one's a tennis player, and the last one's a basketball player.

*Then there's cars: a sedan, an SUV, a truck, and a minivan.

*And don't forget the drinks: water, tea, root beer, and coffee.

*And flowers! Carnations, lilies, daffodils, and roses.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

Okay, so they gave us some clues... lemme see if I can figure this out...

*  The coffee drinker lives somewhere near the tennis player.
*  The daffodils and lilies are right next to each other.
*  The swimmer's house is right next to the sedan.
*  The truck is right next to the carnations.
*  The lilies are somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
*  The tennis player is somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
*  The swimmer doesn't live in the first house.
*  The basketball player is right next to the truck.
*  The minivan's in the last house.
*  The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Whew! That's a lot of clues!

Let me think...

(After some scribbling and muttering)

I think the truck is in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it. They all like different stuff - one drinks water, one likes coffee, and one drinks tea.  They also got different cars - one's got a fancy convertible, one's got a regular car, and one's got a minivan. And they all read different books - one likes those fantasy ones, one likes sci-fi, and one likes history. Oh, and they're eatin' different fruits too - apples, oranges, and mangos.

Now, they gave us some clues:

1. The tea drinker's in the first house.
2. The apple eater lives somewhere before the minivan guy.
3. The convertible guy lives somewhere after the sci-fi reader.
4. The fantasy reader and the coffee drinker live in houses that ain't next to each other.
5. The orange eater ain't in the second house.

Hmm... lemme think...

So, the tea drinker's in the first house. That means the coffee drinker and the fantasy reader gotta be in the other two houses.  And the apple eater's gotta be before the minivan guy...

I think the coffee drinker's in the third house. 

**(A) 3** 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right?  One fella likes red, one likes yellow, and one likes white. And they each like different books - one's into those fantasy stories, one likes lovey-dovey books, and one likes mysteries.

Well, it says the red guy is in the middle house. And the mystery guy is right next to him, so he's gotta be in the last house.  That leaves the first house for the fantasy book reader.

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Well, shoot, that's easy!  The fella with the SUV is in house number **3**. Clue number 5 says so plain as day! 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Let me see...

Three houses, huh?  And they gotta have different stuff in 'em.  

Okay, so the TV guy is right next to the tea drinker, and the tea drinker ain't in the middle house.  That means the TV's gotta be in the first house, and the tea drinker's in the last one.

And the kiwi eater is somewhere after the coffee drinker...

Gosh, this is makin' my head spin!  Lemme think...

(After some more mumbling and head-scratching)

I dunno, I'm not so good with these puzzles.  Maybe someone else can figure it out! 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

They like different books, eat different fruits, and wear different shoes.  It's a lot to keep track of!

Let's see... the fantasy book person is in the middle house, the third one. And the sci-fi person is somewhere to the right of them.  

Hmmm...  I think the sci-fi person must be in the last house then!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

House 1 guy ate spaghetti, right? And the other fella ate that rice stuff.  The guy in House 1 likes them fancy shoes, loafers I think they're called. So the sandals gotta be in House 2.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it. They all got different stuff, like flowers and fruit and cars.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

* One guy drinks only water, and he lives next to the guy with the minivan.
* The water drinker ain't in the first house.
* The last house, number three, that's where the root beer lover lives.
* The sedan is parked in front of the house with the daffodils.
* And the carnations ain't in the last house.
* The sedan is also in front of the house with the apples.
* And the apples are right before the violinist's house.

Hmm... lemme think...

If the root beer guy is in the last house, and the water drinker ain't in the first, then the water drinker must be in the middle house, right? And the minivan's gotta be in the last house with the root beer guy.

And since the sedan is before the daffodils, and the apples, and the violinist, that means the violinist must be in the first house!

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different stuff. Shoes, colors, what they eat... it's a lot to keep track of!

Now, you wanna know where the guy with the loafers lives? Hmm... lemme see...

*Looks at the clues, squints, scratches head*

This is tougher than tryin' to herd cats!  

*Mumbles to self* Yellow's in the third house... grilled cheese is in the last one... high heels are in the second...

*After a long pause*

Hold on, I think I got it!  It's gotta be house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... House number one's got the TV, right? And the flowers ain't lilies in that one. So, the lilies gotta be in house number two. That means the computer's gotta be in house number two too!

(A) 2 

"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One guy eats pizza and likes history books. The other guy eats spaghetti and likes science fiction.  One guy has tulips, the other has daffodils. One's a golfer, the other plays baseball. One plays guitar, the other drums.

The guy who likes science fiction is on the same side as the golfer. The pizza and history guy are next to each other. The guitar player is on the same side as the daffodils.

Hmm...  I think the drummer is in house number **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different person with a pet and stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  

You gotta figure out who lives where.

Hmmm... lemme see...

* The violinist is in the fourth house.
* The bird guy is in the last house.
* And the gameboy fella is somewhere after the guitar player.

Oh, and the TV person is right before the gameboy guy.

Let me think...

...

I got it! The drummer dude is in house number 2!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One's got lilies and the other don't.  And one guy's eatin' apples, the other oranges. One's a swimmer, one plays basketball. One's got a radio, one's got a computer. And one plays the piano, one plays the violin.

Hmm... the radio's gotta be in the house with the guy who eats apples 'cause it says so. And the violin guy's gotta be before the radio guy.

So, the violin guy's gotta be in the first house, right? 


**Answer: (A)** 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these five houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's a basketball player, one's a tennis player, and so on. They all ate different stuff for lunch too.

Now, the tennis guy's in the third house, and the grilled cheese fella's in the last one. The golfer's in the fourth house.

Hmm... the fried rice and spaghetti guys gotta be next to each other, but not in the first two or last two houses.

And the pizza guy's gotta be before the cricket fella.

Oh, and the tennis guy's before the soccer guy.

Let me think...

...

The cricket fella's gotta be in house number **2** (B). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

House 1 has gotta be the one with the white-lovin' fella, 'cause he's right next to the spaghetti guy. And the baseball player's gotta be next to the spaghetti guy too. So, baseball guy's in house 2.

That means the water drinker's in house 2 too, 'cause they're next to the spaghetti guy.

Only shoes left are loafers, so the loafer guy's gotta be in house 2.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella eatin' somethin' different. One's got grapes, one's got oranges, and one's got mangos. And they each like different drinks too - coffee, root beer, or just plain water.

Okay, so... the coffee guy lives somewhere before the mango guy. And the water guy lives somewhere after the root beer guy.  

Oh, and the root beer guy ain't in the middle house, and neither is the orange eater.

That means the mango guy must be in the middle house, right?  

So then the coffee guy's gotta be in the first house, and the root beer guy and the water guy are in the last house.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got spaghetti, one's got pizza, and one's got that rice stuff.

And they're all wearin' different shoes too. One's got fancy loafers, one's got runnin' shoes, and one's got big ol' boots.

Hmm... let's see... the rice guy ain't in the middle house. And the boots guy's right next to him, so he can't be in the first house neither.

Oh, and the spaghetti fella's in the first house for sure.

So, that means the boots guy's gotta be in the second house, and the rice guy's in the last one.

That leaves the loafers guy in the... second house!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Gosh, this is a real head-scratcher!  All those houses and stuff... lemme see...

Okay, so they got cars and food and books and gadgets...  

*scratches head*

Hmm,  I ain't no detective, but maybe if we start with what we know for sure... like, that science fiction fella lives in the third house. And the banana guy's in the fourth.

*mutters to self*

Let's see... oranges, sedan, minivan... they gotta be all in a row...

*pauses for a long time*

This is tougher than I thought!  I'm gonna need more time to figure this out. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it.  Shoes, pets, what they drink, and flowers.  

They give ya clues, like the dog person's in the middle house, and the root beer guy's in the last one.  

You gotta figure out where the lilies are.  Hmm... that's a tough one.  I'm not so good with all these fancy clues.

Let me think...

(After some pondering)

I dunno, maybe it's house number 4?  Could be wrong though. 



"
"Well, the mystery fella lives in the first house, right? And the tennis player ain't in the first house. So, the bookworm who likes them fancy stories gotta be in the second house.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each doin' their own thing.  

You want to know where the white-lovin' fella is? Hmm... lemme see...

It's all mixed up, but I think I got it.  

(B) 4 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one different.  

You wanna know where the water drinker is? Hmm... lemme see...

It's like a puzzle, gotta figure it out bit by bit.  

(C) 4 



"
"That's easy! The fella who likes red is in house number **(C) 1**.  The first house is the one on the left, right? 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different person with different stuff.  

It's like a puzzle, gotta figure out who's got what.  

Hmm, lemme see...  

*Looks at the clues, squints*

This one's tricky!  Lots of words...

*Mumbles to self while looking at the clues*

Okay, so the swimmer's in the fourth house, that's easy. And someone's got boots, they're in the third house.

*Continues mumbling and looking at the clues*

Alright, I think... I think the lilies are in house number... **(C) 2** 



"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One guy's eatin' kiwis, and the other guy's got a bird.  The kiwi guy's in the first house, and the bird guy's next door.  The tennis player's with the apple eater, and they're together too.  The science fiction book guy's in the second house.

Hmm... so the dog guy can't be in the first house. That means he's gotta be in the first house, right?  

So the cricketer must be in the first house too!

(B) 1 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a person with a pet and they ate somethin' different and like sports and fruit.  

That's a lot to keep track of!

Lemme see... they said the guy with the pizza is in the last house, and the grilled cheese is next to him.  And the swimmer's eatin' oranges, and they're in the second house.

Hmm... this is tricky.  

*scratches head*

I dunno, I'm not good with all these puzzles.  Maybe someone else can figure it out. 



"
"Okay, so they got these houses in a row, right? And each one's got a fella livin' in it, and they all got different stuff.  

One guy likes green, and he's in the first house.  And the pizza guy is right next to the blue guy.  

Hmmm... the fried rice fella's in the last house.  And the truck ain't in the third house.

Let me see... mangos are next to the red guy, and the mangos are also next to the pizza guy.  

Pizza and apples are buddies, livin' next door to each other.

Oh, and the truck guy is next to the lilies.

*scratches head*

I think the pizza guy's gotta be in house number **2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one guy's got grapes, the other's got mangos. One's got a fancy car, the other's got a minivan. And one plays cricket, the other baseball.

That baseball fella, he's in the second house, and he's got that fancy car.  

The grape guy can't be in the first house, so he must be in the second house too.

That means the mango guy's gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got apples, one's got kiwis, and one's got oranges.

And they each like a different color too - blue, white, or green.

Hmm... let's see... the fella who likes white lives to the right of the green guy. And the blue guy's in the middle house. Oh, and the blue guy's gotta be left of the kiwi eater.

And the apple guy is right next to the orange guy.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

Hold on... if the blue guy's in the middle, and the kiwi guy's gotta be to his right, then the kiwi guy's gotta be in the last house.

And if the apple guy's next to the orange guy, they gotta be in the first two houses.

So, the green guy's gotta be in the first house, and the white guy's gotta be in the last house.

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's two houses, right? One guy likes mysteries, the other likes fantasy stuff. One drinks root beer, one drinks coffee. One plays soccer, one swims. One's got a phone, one's got a game thing. And one's got tulips, the other roses.

It says the root beer fella is in the house to the right of the roses. So the roses gotta be in the first house, right?

(A) 2 
(B) 1 

Gotta be **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these houses in a row, right? And each one has a person with a different pet and car.  

Let me see... the truck guy is next to the sedan guy, and the fish guy is right next to the dog guy.  The minivan is all the way on the end, and the cat guy ain't in the second house.

Hmmm...  I think the dog guy must be in house number 3. 


(C)
"
"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one likin' a different color and drink.

That fella who likes blue, he's gotta be on the right side of the one who likes yellow. And the yellow fella, he's in the third house. So blue's gotta be in the last house, number 4.

(B) 4 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it. They all got different shoes and pets and stuff.

Let's see... the guy who plays cricket, he's gotta be in the last house 'cause he's on the right side of the guy eatin' oranges. And the baseball fella, he's gotta be in the first house 'cause he's on the left side of the cat guy.

Oh, and the grapes, they gotta be in the first house too, 'cause the cricket guy is after them and the basketball fella is before them.

So, the bird guy... hmm... gotta be in the middle house, right?

(C) 2 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it, doin' different stuff.  

You want to know where the tennis player lives? Hmm, lemme see...

*Looks at the clues, squints, scratches head*

This is a real head-scratcher!  Lots of folks and stuff goin' on.

*Mumbles to self, counting on fingers*

Okay, so the horse guy's in the first house, and the dog fella's in the fourth.  And the coffee drinker's in the last one.

*Taps pencil on table, looks back at clues*

The tennis player's gotta be next to the bird guy...

*Looks up triumphantly*

Aha!  I got it! The tennis player's in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of folks and stuff to keep track of.  Lemme see...

Five houses in a row, huh?  And they all like different things.  

Let me think...  

(After a long pause)

I dunno, this is hard!  Maybe the history book buff is in house number...  (B) 2?  

I'm not real good with puzzles, but that just seems like a good guess. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella plays the guitar, the other plays the cello. One's got a computer, the other's got one of them gameboy things. And one's got a dog, the other's got fish.

The cello player's house is right next to the gameboy guy's. And the dog ain't in the first house.

That means the dog's gotta be in the second house, right?

**(B)** 



"
"Okay, so they got these houses in a row, right?  And each one's got a different kinda car and thingy inside.

The guy with the game thingy lives in the third house, and the minivan's in the first one.  The phone guy is right next to the SUV guy. And the radio guy's gotta be somewhere after the game guy.

Hmmm...  

I think the SUV guy's gotta be in the third house. 


**(B)** 3 

"
"Okay, so there are these five houses in a row, right? And each one has a different kinda flower and thingamajig inside.

Let's see... the tulips are in the middle house, the third one. And the computer's in the second house.  

Hmm, the phone's gotta be next to the TV, and the lilies are somewhere after the phone.  

Oh, and the daffodils are last, in the fifth house.

I think the carnations are in the second house, next to the computer. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 

"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it with a pet and they all like different sports and shoes.  

That cricketer fella, he's in the second house. And the golfer's in the fourth.  The bird guy's in the first house.

Hmm, lemme see... the sandals are in the third house, and the baseball guy's gotta be after that.

*thinks hard*

I reckon the dog fella's gotta be in the third house. 


**(C) 3** 

"
"Well, lemme see...

There's two houses, right? One fella likes root beer, the other one likes plain water. One's eatin' a banana, the other one's got grapes. One had pizza, the other had stew. One drives a truck, the other one's got a minivan. And one's got a radio, the other one's got a computer.

That's a lot to keep track of!

Okay, so the radio and the truck are right next to each other, and the grapes are right next to the computer.  And the fella with the radio is somewhere to the left of the pizza guy. Oh, and the root beer fella doesn't live in the first house.

Hmmm... that means the pizza guy must be in the second house!

**(A) 2** 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There are four houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff they like.

* One likes tea, and they live in the first house.
* The pizza guy lives next to the tea drinker.
* Milk comes before spaghetti, and spaghetti comes before water.
* The white-lovin' person lives next to the water drinker.
* Coffee comes before yellow.
* Green ain't in the first house, and neither is grilled cheese.

Hmm...

Let me think...

* Tea's in the first house, and pizza's next to it.
* So, that's tea, pizza...
* Then comes spaghetti, 'cause it's before water.
* And water's gotta be last, so that's spaghetti, water...
* White's next to water, so that's spaghetti, white, water...
* Milk comes before spaghetti, so it's milk, spaghetti, white, water...
* Coffee comes before yellow, so it's gotta be coffee, yellow...

Hold on...

That means green's gotta be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff.  Like, one has a dog, one likes fish, and so on.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  They give you clues, and you gotta figure out who lives where.

After lookin' at all the clues, I think the fella who likes red lives in house number **2**.

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

You wanna know where the lily guy lives?  Hmm, lemme see...

*Looks at clues, scratches head*

This is tricky! Lots of words...

*Mumbles to self*

Swimmer's gotta be before the milk fella... and the water guy's after the milk fella...

*Continues mumbling and looking at clues*

Okay, I think I got it!

(D) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it. One's a golfer, one plays basketball, and the other one likes soccer. They each ate somethin' different too - grilled cheese, spaghetti, or pizza. And they got different flowers in their houses - lilies, daffodils, or tulips.

Now, lemme see... the soccer guy's in the last house, that's for sure. And the tulips ain't in the last house neither.  

Hmm... the golfer's gotta be next to the basketball guy. And the lilies are right next to the grilled cheese.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the grilled cheese can't be in the first house, 'cause there wouldn't be nothin' to the left of it.

So, the grilled cheese gotta be in the **second house**.

(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, they ate different stuff, like spaghetti and pizza, and they all like different colors, right?  And they play music too?

Well, it says the guy who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house. And the piano player is in the third house.  And, get this, the fried rice guy is also in the third house!

So the answer is (D) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... four houses, four folks, and they all got different stuff goin' on.  Shoes, food, drinks... that's a lot to keep track of!

Okay, so the tea drinker's in the middle house, that's number three. And someone who ate stew is livin' to the left of the spaghetti eater.  

Gosh, this is makin' my head spin!  

(C) 1 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different stuff.  

You want to know where the fella with the computer is?  Hmm, lemme see...

* The radio guy's in the middle house, that's for sure.
* And the basketball fella's in the last house.

Let me think...  

(After some mumbling and head scratching)

I think the computer guy's gotta be in the second house! 


**(B) 2** 

"
"Well, if the fella who ate that rice stuff lives on the right side of the bookworm who likes them space stories, then the space guy gotta be in the first house, right?

(B) 1 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The piano player lives in the first house, right? And the horse person can't be in the second house 'cause the root beer drinker's gotta be to their right. So the horse person's gotta be in the first house too.

That means the dog person's gotta be in the second house!

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

One likes history books, one likes romance books, one likes sci-fi, and one likes fantasy books. They all ate different things for lunch too - fried rice, spaghetti, pizza, and stew. And they all play different instruments - violin, drums, saxophone, and guitar.

There are a bunch of clues, but basically, the drummer lives to the right of the sci-fi person, and the stew eater is in the second house. The pizza eater is in the last house.

Hmmm... let me see...

(Thinking hard)

The drummer lives in house **3**.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we got three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different stuff.  

One fella likes white, and he's gotta be in the first house.  And the horses, they're in the first house too, 'cause they're next to the daffodils, and the daffodils are in the second house.

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella eatin' somethin' different. One's got apples, one's got oranges, and one's got them fancy mangos. And they each like a different drink too - coffee, root beer, or milk.

Now, it says the coffee guy lives right next to the milk fella. And the mango guy is right next to the apple guy. Oh, and the apple guy's in the last house.

Hmmm... so if the apple guy's in the last house, and the mango guy's next to him, the mango guy must be in the middle house. That means the coffee guy's gotta be in the first house, 'cause he's next to the milk guy.

So the milk guy's gotta be in house number... **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it wearin' different shoes and likin' different stuff.

That science fiction guy's gotta be in the middle house, that's for sure. And the fella with the carnations is in the first house.

Hmm... the red-lovin' guy's gotta be next to the loafer fella. And the white-lovin' guy's next to the tulip guy.

Oh, and the history guy's gotta be on the right side of the tulips.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the boots guy can't be in the last house.

So, if I put it all together, the boots guy's gotta be in the middle house.

(C) 2 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The water fella's in the first house, right? And the lily lady's in the middle one.  That means the milk drinker's gotta be in the last house.  

So, the roses gotta be in the last house too!

(B) 3 



"
"Okay, so lemme see... four houses, four folks, and a whole lotta stuff they got goin' on.  

Hmm, let's see... the fella in the first house has loafers, and the guy in the third house likes yellow and plays tennis.  

Oh, and the cricketer is right next to the guy with the sandals.  

Gosh, this is tricky!  

*scratches head*

I dunno, maybe house number 2? 


(B) 2 

"
"The yellow lover's in house number 1.  That's what it says right there in clue number 4! 

(A) 1 

"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a different thingamajig - a computer, a radio, or a TV. And they each got different flowers, like carnations, roses, or tulips. And they each like a different sport, like golf, soccer, or tennis.

That's a lot to keep track of!

Let's see... the tennis player lives somewhere before the TV person. And the golfer ain't in the middle house. The computer and tulips are right next to each other. And the radio is after the roses, and after the TV too.

Hmm... I think the computer's gotta be in the last house. 


(A) 3
"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella livin' in it, doin' different stuff.  

You wanna know which house has the guy with the sandals?  Hmm, lemme see...

* The swimmer's in the middle house, that's number 3.
* And the daffodils are in the last house, number 5.

Let me think...  

*  Oh yeah, the violinist's in house number 2.

* And the cricketer's in house number 4.

Now, it says the sandals are next to the tulips... and there's gotta be two houses between the sandals and the cellist.

Hmmm...  I'm gonna say the sandals are in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The fella in the second house ate grilled cheese, that's for sure. And the one with the fancy shoes is next to the fish guy. So, the stew eater gotta be in the first house, right?

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like books and animals and colors.

It's a bit of a head-scratcher, but if you look at all the clues, you can figure it out.  

The cat person is in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so they're sayin' there are four houses in a row, and each one has a different fella livin' in it. Each fella's got a different thingamajig, plays a different tune on somethin', eats a different fruit, wears different shoes, and likes a different kinda book.

They give us a bunch of clues, like who lives next to who and what they got.  After thinkin' it over real hard, I figured out the fella eatin' oranges is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one different.  

You wanna know who's eatin' apples?  Hmm, lemme see...

It's like a puzzle, gotta figure it out piece by piece.  

(C) 4 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each doin' their own thing.  

Lemme see... stew, sci-fi books, trucks... that's a lot to keep track of!

Hold on, lemme scribble somethin' down...

*scratches on paper*

Hmm, tough one.  I ain't too good with all these clues and whatnot.  

But, if I had to guess, I'd say the pizza guy is in house number **(A) 4**. 

Just a hunch, though! 



"
"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one likes a different kinda book and plays a different thingamajig, like a fiddle or somethin'.

Let's see... the mystery fella's in the fourth house, and the sax guy's there too.  And the drummer's gotta be right next to the romance reader.  

Hmm... the history buff's one house away from the guitar player, and the sax and fiddle guys are right next to each other.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the fiddle player's gotta be in the third house! 


(C)
"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a fella in it with somethin' different. One's got a radio, one's got a phone, one's got a TV, and one's got one of them Gameboy things. And they all got different shoes too.

Well, the fella with the TV is in the last house, number four. And the guy with the loafers is in house number two.  

Now, the phone guy ain't in house number two, and the boots guy is somewhere before the loafers guy.

And get this, there's two houses between the radio guy and the sandals guy.

Hmmm... lemme think...

(After a bit of scratching his head)

I reckon the Gameboy guy must be in house number one! 


**(C)**
"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

It says right there in the first clue that the one with the fancy shoes lives in the middle house. So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella's got loafers, the other's got fancy shoes. And one likes them history books, the other likes mysteries.

The loafers guy don't live in the first house, so he must be in the second one, right?

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff.  

They got flowers, like tulips and stuff, and some have phones, some got TVs, and some wear fancy shoes.  One guy ate stew, another had pizza...

It's a real mess, but lemme see...

* The pizza guy is next to the sandals guy.
* And the tulips are right before the pizza.
* Oh, and the running shoes guy is next to the gameboy guy.

Hmm...  I think the pizza guy is in house number **3**. 


(B)
"
"Well, lemme see...

The mango fella's in the first house, right? And the sax guy ain't in the first house, so he must be in the second one.  That leaves the apple eater in the second house too, I reckon.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

It says the coffee drinker is in the fourth house. So the answer is (E) 4. 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a different kinda flower and car.  

Let's see... the tulips ain't in the last house. And the SUV is right next to the lilies.  

Hmm, the rose bouquet and the sedan gotta be together, but the roses ain't in the middle house.

That means the truck's gotta be in the last house, right?

(C) 3 



"
"Gosh, that's a lot of stuff to keep track of!  Lemme see... houses, music, flowers, drinks, and books...  

It's like one of them brain teaser things my niece shows me sometimes.  

Hmm... tulips are in the last house, that's a start. And lilies are in the fourth.  

*scratches head*

This is harder than it looks!  I'm gonna need more time with this one.  Maybe a cuppa joe will help me think. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

You wanna know where the basketball guy lives? Hmm... lemme see...

* The yellow lover's in the first house, and he's eatin' kiwis.
* The fancy car, the convertible, is in the last house.

That's a start, I guess.  

*  ... *scratches head*

This is harder than it looks!  

(C) 3 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right?  And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

One likes green, one likes yellow, and one likes blue.  

One ate grilled cheese, one had pizza, and one had stew.

And one likes fantasy books, one likes romance books, and one likes mystery books.

Let's see... the green person is in the last house. And the yellow person is right next to them.  

The stew person is next to the romance book person. And the grilled cheese person isn't in the middle house.

Hmmm...  I think the blue person must be in the first house. 


**(C) 1** 

"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower, a music thing, a car, a pet, and a favorite color.  

They gave us some clues, like the tulip person lives next to the bird person. And the yellow lover is in the last house.

Hmm... lemme think...  

(After some scribbling and muttering)

I think the bird person is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Well, lemme see... the fantasy fella lives in the first house, right? And he plays the cello too.  That means the other house must be where the mystery reader lives, 'cause there's only two houses.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses and folks livin' in 'em, each doin' their own thing.  

You wanna know where the swimmer is?  Hmm, lemme see...

This is gonna take some thinkin'... all these clues...

*scratches head*

Alright, I'm gonna need to look at all these clues real careful-like.  

Give me a bit, and I'll see if I can figure it out. 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One's a golfer, one's a swimmer, and one's a cricket player. And they each like different books too - one's into sci-fi, one likes history, and one likes fantasy.

They tell us the golfer's in the middle house, and the history guy's in the first one.  And the swimmer ain't right next to the sci-fi fan.

So, if the golfer's in the middle, and the history guy's first, the swimmer's gotta be in the last house.

**(C)** 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it doin' different stuff.  

You wanna know who ate the stew?  Hmm, lemme see...

*scratches head*

This is tricky!  Lots of stuff goin' on here.  

*mumbles to self*

Swimmer's next to the apple guy... romance fella's after the swimmer...

*looks confused*

Hold on, I gotta think...

*paces back and forth*

Okay, I think I got it!

(C) 4 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  

They ate different stuff, like one had rice and the other had noodles. One likes kitties and the other likes horsies. One reads about the past and the other reads love stories. And one wears flip flops and the other wears sneakers for runnin'.

The flip flops are next to the horsies. And the history reader is on the same side as the noodles.

I dunno, could be either house for the rice eater! 



"
"Well, lemme see...  

The sedan's gotta be before the lilies, right? And the flute player ain't in the first house. So, the lilies gotta be in the second house.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a different person doin' different stuff.  

They like different books, have different flowers, and play different sports.  It's a bit much to keep track of!

But, lemme see... the mystery book reader is somewhere near the swimmer, and the tennis player is after the mystery reader.  

And the carnations are in the last house, and the roses are in the third.

Hmm...  I think the romance book lover is in the last house.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Hmm, five houses in a row, huh?  And they all got different stuff?  Let me see...

This sounds like one of them brain teasers my cousin Jimmy likes. He's always tryin' to figure out who's got what.

Lemme think...  

(After a long pause)

I dunno, this is a tough one.  Maybe the tulips are in house number...  (D) 4? 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right?  And each one has a fella livin' in it. They all got different shoes and ate different stuff for lunch. One guy's got a fancy car, another's got a regular one, and the last one's got a sporty one.  They all like different sports too, and have different flowers in their house.

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

The minivan's in the last house, and the golfer's in the first.  That means the boots gotta be in the middle house, 'cause they're next to the minivan.

So, the rose bouquet... hmm... it can't be in the middle house, and it can't be in the last one 'cause of the minivan.

That means the rose bouquet's gotta be in the **first house**.

(C) 1 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of folks and stuff to keep track of.  Lemme see...

They said the sax guy is in the third house, right? And the yellow lover is somewhere before him.  So maybe the yellow lover is in house number two?

Gosh, this is hard! I dunno, maybe the drummer is in house number four?  

(C) 4 



"
"Okay, so we got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each eatin' somethin' different and likin' different colors.  

Let's see... that fried rice fella, he's in house number 3.  And the stew guy can't be in houses 2, 3, or 4, and the red lover's gotta be next to him... so the stew guy's gotta be in house 5 and the red lover in house 4.

Now, thinkin' 'bout the white lover... gotta be one house away from the yellow lover... hmm...

(After some more thinking and maybe some doodling)

I think the white lover's in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes a different color and plays a different thing and does a different sport.

That red fella's gotta be in the last house, that's for sure. And the drummer guy's in the middle house.

The fella who plays the fiddle has gotta be to the right of the basketball guy, and the basketball guy's gotta be to the right of the tennis guy.

So, if the basketball guy ain't in the last house, and he's gotta be to the right of the tennis guy, he's gotta be in the middle house, right?

(C) 2 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of stuff to keep track of.  

Let me see... houses in a row, flowers, music...  

I'm gonna need to draw this out.  Give me a sec...

*scribbles on a piece of paper*

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the carnations are.  

*mumbles to himself*

Left of the root beer... cellist is somewhere...  

*more scribbling*

Shoot, this is harder than I thought!  

*looks up hopefully*

You got any more clues? Maybe somethin' about the carnations bein' near somethin' else? 



"
"Gosh, this sounds like one of them brain teasers my niece is always doin'!  

Let me see... five houses in a row, huh? And each one's got a different thing goin' on inside. Flowers, music, cars, books, and pets... that's a lot to keep track of!

I ain't no genius, but maybe if we start with the clues that say things are right next to each other, we can figure it out.  

Hmm... lemme think...

(C) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it.  They got different stuff, like radios and cars and flowers.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

One fella has a dog, and he's in the second house. And there's a fish guy in the third house.

Now, the guy with the tulips, he's gotta be somewhere near the car that goes ""vroom vroom"" real fast, the convertible.

Thinkin' hard...

...

It's gotta be house number four!

**(B)** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One's a cat guy, one's a dog guy, and one's all about fish.

They also eat different grub - spaghetti, stew, or pizza. And they play different games - basketball, cricket, or tennis. Oh, and they each like a different drink - tea, milk, or water.

Now, there's a bunch of clues about who lives where.  

Let me think...

* The basketball fella is in the first house, and he plays the saxophone.

* The tea drinker is next to the cricket player.

* The pizza guy is right next to the dog guy.

* The water drinker and the fish guy have a house between 'em.

* The stew eater is somewhere before the milk drinker.

* Oh, and the cat guy and the guitar player have a house between 'em.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

...

Okay, I think I got it! The dog guy lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One's got a cat person and the other's got a fishy person. One's got a computer, one's got a radio. One likes love stories, one likes old history books. And one's got lilies, one's got daffodils. Oh, and one's wearin' fancy shoes, the other loafers.

Hmm... the history buff's in the first house, that's for sure. And the cat person can't be in the second house.  

The fancy shoes are in the first house, and the daffodils are in the second. So the lilies gotta be in the first house, right?

(B) 1 



"
"Gosh, this is a real head-scratcher!  All these houses and folks and what they're eatin' and playin'...

Lemme see...  

*  Someone's got apples in the third house, and the fella next door's eatin' fried rice.

*  And that carnations fella, he's in the first house, I bet.

Hmm...  I'm gonna need a pencil and paper to keep track of all this.  

(After some scribbling and muttering)

Okay, I think the pizza guy is in house number... **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it. They all like different stuff, like colors and food and music.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

You gotta figure out who lives where based on the clues.

After lookin' at all the clues, I think the cellist lives in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So there's three houses, right? And each one's got someone in it playin' music and eatin' fruit.

The piano player and the kiwi eater are buddies, livin' next door to each other. And the flute player's gotta be on the right side of the violin player.

Oh, and the grape eater's one house away from the kiwi eater, and the violin player's one house away from the kiwi eater too.

That means the piano player's gotta be in the middle house, right?

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Well, the kiwi fella's in house number 1, right?  And the fantasy book reader ain't in that house. So, they gotta be in house number 2.

(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

That red-lovin' fella's gotta be in house number 3.  It says so right there! 


(D) 3 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella likes root beer, the other likes tea. And one plays the piano, the other the cello.  

The root beer guy can't be in the second house, so he must be in the first one, right? 


(A) 1 

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's five houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different shoes and flowers.  

* The fella with the carnations is in the last house, number five.
* And the boots guy is right next to him, so he's in house number four.

Now, the tulips gotta be somewhere before the loafers, and they can't be in house four.  And the daffodils gotta be before the tulips.

Hmmm... I think the daffodils are in house one, then the running shoes in house two, then the tulips in house three.

That means the lilies gotta be in house one, right?

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of folks and stuff to keep track of.  Lemme see... houses in a row, each one different...  

Let me think... think... think...

(A) 4
(B) 3
(C) 1
(D) 2

I'm gonna guess (C) 1.  Just a hunch! 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all ate somethin' different, like spaghetti or stew, and they each like a different color, like white or green. And they're wearin' different shoes too, like boots or high heels.

There's a bunch of clues, but lemme see...

* The high heels ain't in the last house.
* The white-lovin' person is in the first house.
* Spaghetti ain't in the middle house.
* The green-lovin' person is in the middle house.
* The boots are right next to the high heels.
* The boots are somewhere before the stew.
* The stew ain't in the middle house.

Hmm... so the white person is in the first house, and the green person is in the middle.  The high heels can't be last, and the boots gotta be next to 'em, so the boots are first and the high heels are second.  And the stew's gotta be last 'cause it can't be in the middle.

That means the fried rice has gotta be in the middle house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these houses, right? And each one has a different kinda flower and a person who likes a different book.

Let's see... the rose person is in the second house. And the sci-fi person is next to them, so they gotta be in the third house.

The romance person is next to the tulips, so the tulips are in the last house, and the romance person is in the third house.

That means the carnations gotta be in the second house, 'cause the romance person is to the right of them.

So, the last house, the fourth one, has to be the lilies!

(C) 4 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The sci-fi guy's in the first house, right? And the coffee drinker's gotta be before the sandal wearin' fella. So, the romance book lover's gotta be in the other house.

(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella plays drums, the other plays piano, right? And one's got a radio, the other a phone.

It says the drummer's next to the radio guy. So the drummer must be in house number 1, and the radio's in house number 2.

That means the phone's gotta be in house number 1.

(A) 1 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes a different color and drives a different kinda car.

That fella in the middle house, he's got the fancy convertible.  And the guy who likes yellow, he lives right next to the one with the sedan.  

They said there's gotta be another house between the yellow guy and the one who likes white.

So, if the yellow guy ain't in the middle, he's gotta be in the first house!

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em with different stuff.  

Let's see... runnin' shoes are in the first house, that's easy. And the sedan's in the third.  

Hmm, gotta think about the rest.  

*Scratches head*

I dunno, this is makin' my head hurt.  Lots of rules!

(E) 5 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different thing goin' on. Flowers, cars, food, pets, shoes... it's a lot to keep track of!

Lemme see...  the convertible's in the first house, and the loafers are in the second.  And the bird's in the first house too.  

Hmm...  that's a start, I guess.  

*scratches head*

This is harder than it looks!  

(C) 5 



"
"Well, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got someone eatin' somethin' different.  

The fried rice fella's gotta be in the middle house, 'cause that's what it says. And the fantasy book guy's in there too.

So, the spaghetti guy's gotta be in the first house, and that leaves the last house for the grilled cheese.

So it's gotta be (C) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, one house has tulips and a dog, and the other has carnations and horses.  It says the carnations are somewhere to the left of the dog.  That means the carnations gotta be in house number 1, right?

(B) 1 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the kiwi eater is in house number 2, right? And the water drinker is next to the high heel wearer.  

That means the high heel wearer gotta be in house number 2 too!

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One guy's got a TV, the other's got a phone. One's wearin' fancy shoes, the other sandals. One likes tea, one likes water. And one's eatin' kiwis, the other grapes.

Hmm... it says the fancy shoes are before the sandals, and the grapes are right next to the sandals. So it's gotta be fancy shoes, then grapes, then sandals.

And the tea drinker's gotta be before the TV guy.

So, I think the kiwi guy's gotta be in the first house.

**(B) 1** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes somethin' different to drink and plays a different thing.

The tea fella's in the first house, that's for sure. And the water drinker's gotta be after the cello player.

The violinist can't be in the last house, so he must be in the first one, right? That means the guitar player's gotta be in the last house.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there are these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each wearin' different shoes and drinkin' different stuff.

That fella in the third house, he's wearin' sandals and likes milk.  And the water drinker lives right next to him, so that's gotta be house number four.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses in a row, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it with somethin' different. One's got a phone, one's got a game thing, one's got a computer, one's got a radio, and one's got a TV. And they all ate different stuff for lunch too.

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

* The game thing and the computer gotta be next to each other.
* The TV guy's gotta be somewhere before the phone guy.
* The grilled cheese fella is one house away from the radio guy.
* The game guy is one house away from the fried rice eater.
* Grilled cheese is right next to spaghetti.
* The radio guy ain't in the fourth house.
* Pizza's in the fourth house.
* The computer guy ain't in the fourth house neither.

Hmm... after thinkin' about it real hard, I reckon the spaghetti guy is in house number **3**. 


So the answer is (E).
"
"Gosh, this is a real head-scratcher!  All those houses and folks doin' different things... lemme see...

*Looks at the clues, squints, scratches head*

Hmm,  it says the tennis fella's in the first house, and the baseball guy's next door.  And the one eatin' fried rice is right next to him...

*Mumbles to self, counting on fingers*

That means the orange eater's gotta be in the fourth house, right?  

*Looks back at the clues, eyes widen*

Hold on... the banana eater's gotta be...  

(C) 3 



"
"Well, lemme see...

House 1 has the bird, right? And the guy who eats that fancy cheese stuff is on the right side. So, the pizza guy gotta be in house 1.

(B) 1 



"
"The bird guy lives in house number 3.  That's what it says right there in the clues! 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff.  

They got pets, like horses and fish, and they play music, like piano and drums. Some eat bananas, some apples, some oranges. And they wear different shoes, like fancy shoes and sneakers. And they like different books, like history and stuff.

There are a bunch of clues, but it's kinda confusing.  

I think the answer is (C) 3.  I dunno, it just feels right. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got kiwis, one's got grapes, one's got mangos, and one's got a banana.

And they all like different colors too - green, yellow, red, and white.

Now, this is what I figured out:

* The grape guy's in the second house, that's for sure.
* The red fella's gotta be somewhere after the kiwi guy.
* The green and red guys live right next door to each other.
* The green guy's gotta be before the yellow guy.
* White and red are one house apart.

So, if I put it all together, the kiwi guy's gotta be in the first house.

(C) 1 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The stew person can't be in the house on the right 'cause the runner shoes fella gotta be over there. And the mystery book reader and stew eater are buddies, gotta be next to each other. So, the stew eater's gotta be in the first house.

(B) 1 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower, drink, and thingamajig.

* The water drinker's in the middle house, that's for sure.
* The root beer guy's in the first house.
* And the phone's in the last house, with the daffodils right next to it.

Hmm... the TV ain't in the middle house, and it's gotta be after the tulips...

So, the tulips gotta be in the first house, and the TV's in the last house.

That leaves the milk for the first house too!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it. They all got different shoes and stuff.

Let's see... the guy in the first house has loafers. And the phone guy is somewhere before the mango guy.  

Hmm, the grape guy is right next to the water drinker. And the kiwi guy is next to the milk drinker, but not in the first house. Oh, and the boots guy ain't in the last house, and he's somewhere after the gameboy guy.

Gosh, this is tricky!  I dunno about computers, but I bet it's house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's a baseball guy, one's a golfer, and one likes cricket.

They also got different flowers, like carnations, daffodils, and roses. And each fella's got a pet, like a fish, horses, or a cat.

Now, they gave us some clues, see?

* The golfer ain't in the last house.
* The fish guy lives somewhere before the horse guy.
* The golfer and baseball fella live right next to each other.
* The carnations and the horse guy live right next to each other too.
* The carnations are before the baseball guy.
* The roses are right before the daffodils.
* And the cricket guy ain't in the last house neither.

Hmm... let me think...

If the golfer ain't in the last house, and the cricket guy ain't either, then the baseball guy must be in the last house, right?

And if the carnations are before the baseball guy, they gotta be in the middle house.

And since the horse guy is right next to the carnations, he must be in the last house too!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella livin' in it with a pet and a car and eatin' some fruit.

The fella in the first house is eatin' oranges, and the last house has the horses.  

The truck's gotta be next to the fancy car, and the mango guy and the fancy car guy are neighbors too.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the truck's gotta be in the middle house, right?

(A) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses in a row, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

They play different music things, read different books, and ate different lunches.  

There are a bunch of clues, but if you think about it real hard, you can figure out where the drummer lives.

It's gotta be house number **4**. 



"
"Hmm, five houses in a row, huh?  And they all got different stuff?  Let me see...

This is gonna take some thinkin'.  Lotsa stuff to keep track of.  

*scratches head*

Give me a bit, I'll see if I can figure out where that mango eater is livin'. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes a different color and plays a different thing, like music.  They also got different stuff like a radio or a TV.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

They give you clues, like the guy with the drums is next to the guitar player. And the green guy lives in the middle house.

If you think real hard about it, you can figure out where everyone lives and what they like.

I think the sax player is in house number 2.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, shoot, this is a real head-scratcher!  

They got these two houses, right? One fella likes tea, the other likes that root beer stuff. One plays a fiddle thing, the other a guitar. One's got horses, the other's got a cat. And one reads mysteries, the other likes history books.

They say the fiddle player is somewhere before the mystery reader, and the history guy is before the cat person. And the root beer drinker and guitar player live right next to each other.

Hmm...  I dunno, could be either house for the horse fella.  It's a real puzzler! 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a different person with a different pet and flowers.

Let me see... the carnations are on the right side of whoever has the bird.  And the dog ain't in the middle house.  The tulips are on the right side of the dog.

Hmm... if the dog ain't in the middle, and the tulips are on the right side of the dog, then the dog must be in the first house! That means the tulips gotta be in the second house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of folks and stuff to keep track of.  

Let me see... houses in a row, each one different...  

*scratches head*

I'm not real good with all these clues, but maybe...  

Could it be house number **(D) 2**? 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got oranges, one's got kiwis, one's got mangos, and one's got a banana. And they all got different critters too - horses, a dog, a bird, and a cat.

Now, the mango guy's in the first house, that's for sure. And the horse guy ain't in the first house, or the second one neither.

Hmm... the bird guy and the kiwi guy live right next to each other. And the banana guy ain't in the third house, but he's right next to the dog guy.

Thinkin'... thinkin'...

Gotta be the fourth house, right? That's the only place left for the bird guy.


**(B) 4** 

"
"Well, lemme see...

That mystery fella's gotta be in the first house, right?  And the bird person's gotta be next to the history buff.  

So, the romance reader can't be in the last house, and neither can the horse person.  That means the romance reader's gotta be in the middle house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Well, lemme see...

That coffee fella, he's gotta be in house number **2**.  It says so right in the clues! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see... it says right here the banana eater is in house number 3.  

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all like different stuff, like books and food and shoes.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

One guy likes mysteries, one likes history, and one likes those space books. And they all ate different things for lunch - spaghetti, rice, or stew.

I think the guy with the stew lives in the middle house, 'cause it says he's somewhere to the right of the high heels, and the golfer is to the right of the roses.

And the soccer player is in the middle house, so...

Hmm...

I think the guy with the carnations lives in the first house. 


**(A)** 

"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all got different stuff, like one plays music, one wears fancy shoes, and one has a gadget.

I'm not good with all these clues, but lemme see...

The truck guy is next to the one with the game thing. And the minivan is after the truck.  The music person with the big cello thingy is next to the minivan.

Hmm... I think the drummer fella is in the first house.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

They're sayin' the apple eater's in house number 4.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Well, lemme see...

That lily lady's gotta be in the middle house, right?  And the coffee person's gotta be next to the rose person, and the SUV person too.  So, the coffee person's gotta be in the last house.

(C) 3 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it. They all got different cars and stuff.

Let's see... one guy likes blue, one likes red, and one likes green.  And they all ate somethin' different for lunch - grilled cheese, spaghetti, or stew.

Hmm...  

* The blue guy lives next to the spaghetti eater.
* The stew guy lives somewhere before the lilies.
* The roses are next to the truck.
* The minivan guy is before the stew guy.
* The red guy don't live in the first house.
* The minivan guy is before the daffodils.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

...

Wait a minute! If the minivan guy is before the stew guy, and the stew guy is before the lilies, then the minivan guy must be in the first house, right? And then the truck guy must be in the last house 'cause the roses are next to the truck.

So the truck guy lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda car and stuff.  

Let's see... spaghetti's gotta be next to the tennis player, and stew ain't in the last house.  Red's right next to the sedan, and the convertible ain't in the first house.

Oh, and the soccer player's in the second house, and the flutist's in the third. Basketball's in the last house, and so's the SUV.

Hmm...  the cellist's next to the flutist, and grilled cheese ain't in the last house. Green ain't in the third house, and white's in the last house. Spaghetti's before the saxophonist, and the sedan ain't in the second house.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!  

(Looks at the clues again, scratches head)

I think the sedan's gotta be in the **first house**. 


**(A)**
"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's got boots, one's got fancy runnin' shoes, and one's got sandals.  They're all eatin' different fruit too, and one's got a game thing, one's got a phone, and one's got a TV.

Hmm... let's see...

* The grape guy's gotta be on the right side of the red guy.
* The phone guy's right next to the runnin' shoe guy.
* There's one house between the apple guy and the sandal guy.
* The game thing's in the last house.
* The red guy's in the middle house.
* The white guy's gotta be left of the grape guy.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

...

Alright, I think I got it! The phone guy's gotta be in the **first house (C)**. 



"
"The bird guy lives in house number 2.  That's what the first thing says! 



"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One guy likes tea and the other likes water. One reads love stories and the other likes those space books. One plays drums and the other plays that windy thing, a saxophone, I think. One plays golf and the other plays baseball. And one eats mangoes and the other eats grapes.

They said the saxophone player is in the first house. And the grape eater is next to the tea drinker and the baseball player. So, the first house must have the saxophone player, the tea drinker, and the grape eater.

That means the baseball player and the mango eater must be in the second house.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Gosh, that's a lot of stuff to keep track of!  Lemme see... five houses, five folks, and they all like different things.  

Hmm, let me think...  

(Starts scribbling on a piece of paper, muttering to himself)

Okay, so the apple eater is in the fourth house, and the runner guy is in the first.  

Now, where's that romance book lover?  

(Scratches head)

This is harder than it looks!  Maybe I need another cup of coffee...

(Looks at the options)

(A) 3
(B) 2
(C) 5
(D) 1
(E) 4

Aw, shucks, I don't know!  They all sound like good guesses. 



"
"Well, shoot, that's easy!  The fella wearin' the boots is in house number **(A) 1**.  It says so right there in the clues! 



"
"Hmm, this sounds tricky!  Lots of folks and stuff to keep track of.  Lemme see... houses in a row, different foods, shoes, and games...  

I'm gonna need to draw this out.  Give me a sec...

*scribbles on a piece of paper*

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tea drinker lives.  

*more scribbling*

Shoot, this is harder than I thought!  I'm gonna need more time to figure this out. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it, and they all like different stuff.  

You wanna know who likes green?  Hmm, lemme see...

* The tea guy's in the first house, that's easy.
* And the flowers, the tulips are in the last house.

Gosh, this is a lot to keep track of!

*  Let me see... blue's gotta be next to the pizza guy...

* And the lilies are in the second house...

* Oh, and the fried rice and water guys are a couple houses apart...

*  Hold on, lemme think...

(After a long pause, muttering to himself)

*  Alright, I think I got it! The green guy's in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person livin' in it.  They got different cars and stuff, and they eat different things.

You wanna know who ate the fried rice, huh?  

Well, lemme see... it's gotta be one of these houses, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

*Looks at clues intensely, scratching head*

Hmm, this is tricky.  Lotsa words...

*Mumbles to self*

Okay, so the tulips are in the first house, and that guy ate spaghetti.  

*Continues mumbling and looking at clues*

Fried rice ain't in the last house...

*After a long pause*

I think... I think the fried rice is in house **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One guy likes red, the other likes yellow. One eats oranges, one eats grapes. One reads mysteries, one reads fantasy. One drives a truck, one drives a fancy car. One wears boots, one wears sneakers.

It says the grape guy lives next to the truck guy, and the yellow guy is next to the truck guy too. So they gotta be in a row: yellow, grapes, truck.

And the boots guy is next to the mystery reader.

Hmm... that means the fantasy reader must be in the other house, right?

So the answer is (B) House 1. 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a person with different stuff.  Like, one likes yellow, one likes red, and so on.  

You wanna know who ate the fried rice?  Hmm, lemme see...

*Looks at clues, scratches head*

This is tricky!  Lots of words...

*Mumbles to self*

Minivan next to fried rice...  

*Looks back at clues*

Aha!  

(B) 4 



"
"Okay, so they got these houses in a row, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

One guy eats spaghetti, and he's gotta be in the first house 'cause it says so.  And the golfer's in the last house.  

Now, the pizza guy's right next to the basketball fella.  So, pizza's gotta be in house number two, and basketball's in three.

That's all I got.  This is makin' my head hurt!

(B) 3 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who plays somethin' different. One's a cellist, one's a violinist, and one bangs on drums. And they each play a sport too - soccer, basketball, or cricket.

That basketball fella, he's in the middle house, and he's also the violinist, huh?

And the cellist's gotta be on the right side of the cricket guy.

So, if the middle house is taken, and the cellist's gotta be further right, the cricket guy's gotta be in the first house. That leaves the soccer fella in the first house too.

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff. Flowers, colors they like, what they drink, and the kinda books they read.

There's a bunch of clues, but the important ones are:

* The mystery reader is in the last house.
* The water drinker is also in the last house.
* The history book person is right next to the lilies.

And a few others, but those are the ones that stuck out to me.

If the mystery reader and water drinker are in the last house, and the history book person is right before the lilies, then the tea drinker has to be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different fella livin' in it, doin' different stuff.  

You wanna know where the fish guy lives? Hmm... lemme see...

* The coffee drinker's in the last house, and he plays the flute and has horses. Makes sense, fancy fella.
*  The tennis player ain't in the last house, and neither is the milk drinker.

Gosh, this is tricky!  

*  The guitar player's gotta be after the cricket player, huh?

Let me think... think... think...

(After some more pondering)

I dunno, this is hard! Maybe the fish guy's in house number... **(C) 2** ?  I'm not sure though. 



"
"Well, the piano player's in house number 2, right? And they said the flower person lives right next door. So it's gotta be house number 1.

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it, eatin' different stuff and drivin' different cars.  

They gave us some clues, like the orange guy's in the first house, and the banana guy's in the fourth.  And the SUV's in the fourth house too.

Now, they want to know where the sedan guy lives.  Hmm... gotta think about this...

*Looks at the clues again, scratching head*

I dunno, this is tricky!  I'm better at fixin' cars than solvin' puzzles.

(C) 4 



"
"Well, lemme see...

The soccer fella's in house number 2, right? And the blue lover's gotta be next to the root beer drinker. So, the root beer drinker's gotta be in house number 2 too!

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different sport and flowers and stuff.  

Let's see... it says the daffodils are in the second house. And the yellow-liking person is right next to them. So yellow must be in the first house.

Hmm, this is tricky.  Lots of back and forth stuff.  

*scratches head*

Give me a minute, I gotta think... 


(After a bit of mumbling and scribbling)

Okay, I think the swimmer is in house number **(C) 3**. 

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

The fiddler guy is in the first house, right? And the computer thingy is in the same house too. So the bird person gotta be in the other house.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different thing goin' on. Flowers, shoes, what they ate, all that jazz.  

You wanna know where the computer is? Hmm, lemme see...

*Looks at the clues, squints*

Well, the pizza guy's in house number 4, and the TV's in house 3.  

*Scratches head*

This is harder than it looks!

*Mumbles to self*

Okay, so the boots are in house 2... and the rose thing is in house 1...

*Looks up triumphantly*

Aha! I got it! The computer's gotta be in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different stuff. One's got boots, one's got fancy shoes, and one's got sneakers.  

They also got different cars - a fancy car, a big truck, and a regular car. And they like different animals - cats, fish, and dogs.

Hmm... let's see... the guy with the boots is in the middle house. And the fancy shoes guy is next to the dog lover.  The regular car is in the last house.

Oh, and the cat guy is in the first house.

So, if the boots guy is in the middle, and the fancy shoes guy is next to the dog lover, that means the dog lover must be in the middle house too!

That leaves the sneakers for the last house.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

We gotta figure out who's eatin' apples.

Hmm... the tea drinker's in the last house, and the first house has carnations and runnin' shoes.

The fella with the tulips is in the middle house.

That's all I got.  This is harder than it looks! 



"
"Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it who likes different books. One likes mysteries, one likes them space books, and one likes history stuff.

They also got different gadgets: a computer, a TV, and a phone.

Well, it says the mystery guy lives in the first house. And he's right next to the history guy. So the history guy must be in the second house.

And the mystery guy is right next to the TV too, so the TV's gotta be in the second house too.

That leaves the computer guy in the last house.

So, the space book fella... gotta be in the second house, right?
