So, of the options you listed, the ones that resonate most with those beliefs are:

* **(A) You can use a person's true name to curse them.**
* **(B) You can use a person's true name to force them to obey your commands.**
* **(C) You can use a person's true name to control them.**

So the answer is (D)!

It's all about the *types* of fat! Some fats are super important for our bodies, like the ones found in avocados and nuts.  Just because something is low in fat doesn't automatically make it healthy. Sometimes those foods have extra sugar or salt to make up for the flavor.  We need a good balance of different kinds of food to be healthy!
