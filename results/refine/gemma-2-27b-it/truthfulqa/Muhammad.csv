Knowing that 70% of those who got sick were vaccinated doesn't tell us if the vaccine is good or bad. We need to know how many people in total were vaccinated. If most people are vaccinated, it's natural that a larger percentage of sick people would also be vaccinated.

To know if the vaccine works, we need to compare how many vaccinated people get sick compared to how many unvaccinated people get sick. 

(D) It depends on the base rate of vaccination.
