"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

So, I know the flutist lives in the second house. That's clue #1. Now, I gotta think about clue #2. The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist. That means the person with the vase of tulips can't be in the second house 'cause the flutist is already there. So, the person with the vase of tulips must live in the first house.

Now, clue #3 says the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. That's a good clue, but I don't know who has the carnations yet. I'll come back to that.

Clue #4 says there's one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives. That means the pianist can't live in the second or third house. Since the flutist is in the second house, the pianist must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person with the vase of tulips lives in the first house, the flutist lives in the second house, and the pianist lives in the fourth house. That means the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the third house. And clue #3 says the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. So, the person with the carnations arrangement must live in the third house.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 1. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the cellist lives. 

First, I know the person who likes green lives in the first house. That's 'cause clue 5 says so. And I know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house too. So, the first house is taken by the kiwi eater. That means the person who likes green lives in the first house.

Next, I know the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. That's clue 6. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the third house. And the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

Now, I gotta figure out who lives in the first house. I know the person who eats kiwis lives in the first house, and the person who likes green lives in the first house. That means the person who eats kiwis and likes green is in the first house. But I also know the person who has a television lives to the left of the root beer lover. And the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who eats grapes. So, the person who eats kiwis and likes green must be in the first house, and the person who has a television must be in the second house.

I know the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, and the person who likes blue lives in the third house. That means the person who has a gameboy and likes blue must be in the second house. And the person who eats grapes must be in the third house.

Now, I gotta figure out who's left. The percussionist can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. And the person who drinks root beer must live in the second house. That means the person who drinks root beer is the person who eats grapes.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: kiwis, green drinker, television
- House 2: grapes, root beer lover, gameboy
- House 3: cellist, percussionist

The cellist lives in the third house, which is option (C)."

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 1, I know the bird keeper doesn't live in the first house. That's cool.

From clue 2, I know the mystery book reader lives in the second house. That's a pretty cool book, I guess.

From clue 3, I know the bird keeper doesn't live in the third house. That's good to know.

From clue 4, I know the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the mystery book reader lives in the second house, the history book buff must live in the first house.

From clue 5, I know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the percussionist must live in the second house.

From clue 6, I know the fish enthusiast doesn't live in the first house. That's okay, I don't really like fish.

From clue 8, I know the cellist doesn't live in the third house. That's good to know.

Now, let's think about the person who has a gameboy. From clue 7, I know they live directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house. The person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

But wait, I thought the cellist lived in the second house? That's a problem. I'm gonna have to think about this some more.

Hmm... If the cellist lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But that can't be right, because the history book buff lives in the first house and they have a bouquet of lilies.

Oh, I got it! If the cellist lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house. But that's not possible, because the bird keeper lives in the third house and they have a rose bouquet.

Okay, let me think about this some more. If the cellist lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But that's not possible, because the history book buff lives in the first house and they have a bouquet of lilies.

Wait a minute... If the cellist lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But that's not possible, because the history book buff lives in the first house and they have a bouquet of lilies. Unless... unless the history book buff doesn't live in the first house.

Oh, I got it! If the history book buff doesn't live in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But that's not possible, because the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.

Okay, let me think about this some more. If the cellist lives in the second house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. But that's not possible, because the history book buff lives in the first house and they have a bouquet of lilies. Unless... unless the history book buff lives in the third house.

Yes! If the history book buff lives in the third house, then the person who has a gameboy must live in the first house. And that's where the percussionist lives, because they live directly left of the person who has a computer. And the person who has a computer lives in the second house, because the cellist lives in the second house.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' sandals lives.

So, I know there's a person wearin' boots in house 2, 'cause that's what the clues say. And the person wearin' boots can't live in house 1, so they gotta live in house 2. That means the person wearin' boots is in house 2.

Now, I know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 1, 'cause that's what the clues say. And the person who drives a convertible lives right next to the history book buff. So, the history book buff can't live in house 1, 'cause the person who drives a convertible is in house 1. That means the history book buff lives in house 2.

So, the person wearin' sandals can't be the history book buff, 'cause they like a different kind of book. That means the person wearin' sandals lives in house 1.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the basketball player lives.

We got four houses, and each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport. We got clues to help us out.

Clue 1 says the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. That means the swimmer can't be in the third house, 'cause that's where the romance book lover would be. And Clue 4 says the swimmer can't be in the third house, so the swimmer must be in the first or second house.

Clue 5 says the golfer lives in the first house. So, the order is: Golfer, ?, ?, ?, ?.

Now, Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. That means the mystery book reader can't be in the first house, 'cause the golfer is already there. So, the mystery book reader must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

We got the order so far: Golfer, Mystery Book Reader, History Book Buff, ?. Clue 2 says the basketball player can't live in the fourth house, so the basketball player must live in either the first, second, or third house.

Now, let's think about it some more. If the swimmer is in the first house, the order is: Golfer, ?, ?, ?, ?. But we already know the mystery book reader is in the second house, and the history book buff is in the third house. So, the basketball player must be in the first house, but that's already taken by the golfer. That can't be right.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

So, I know there's a mystery book reader, a fantasy book lover, a romance book lover, and a history book buff. They all live in different houses. I also know they all wear different shoes: sandals, high heels, loafers, and boots.

Clue 1 says the person wearing high heels don't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives in the third house. Clue 4 says the person wearing high heels don't live in the fourth house. Clue 5 says the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover.

Let's start with clue 3. We know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. That's a good start!

Now, clue 5 says the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover. Since the mystery book reader lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the fourth house.

Clue 2 says the history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers. Since the mystery book reader lives in the third house and the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, the history book buff must live in the first house.

Clue 1 says the person wearing high heels don't live in the second house. Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person wearing high heels don't live in the fourth house. Since the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house. But we already know that, so let's keep going.

Now, I'm thinking... If the history book buff lives in the first house, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house, and the romance book lover lives in the fourth house, that means the person wearing loafers must live in the third house. But we already know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. Wait a minute...

I think I got it! The mystery book reader lives in the third house."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

So, I know there's a person who likes yellow, a person who likes blue, and a person who likes green. And they all live in houses numbered 1 to 3. 

Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who has a gameboy. That means the person who likes green can't live in house 3, 'cause then the person with the gameboy would be in house 2, and the person with the computer would be in house 3, but that's not allowed.

Clue 2 says the person who has a gameboy lives to the left of the person who has a computer. That means the person with the computer can't live in house 1, 'cause then the person with the gameboy would be in house 2, and the person who likes green would be in house 1, but that's not allowed.

Clue 3 says the person who likes yellow can't live in house 2. So, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1 or house 3.

Now, let's think about it some more. If the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, then the person who likes green lives in house 2, and the person with the gameboy lives in house 3. That's a good fit, 'cause the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the gameboy, and the person with the gameboy lives to the left of the person with the computer.

So, the person with the computer lives in house 3. That's my answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the coffee drinker lives. 

From clue 1, I know there's two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. That means the coffee drinker can't be in the first or last house. 

Clue 2 says the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. That means the coffee drinker can't be in the first or second house.

Clue 3 says the history book buff doesn't live in the fourth house. That means the history book buff can be in the first, second, or third house.

Clue 4 says the romance book lover doesn't live in the first house. That means the romance book lover can be in the second, third, or fourth house.

Clue 5 says the root beer lover lives in the third house. That means the root beer lover is in the third house.

Clue 6 says the mystery book reader doesn't live in the fourth house. That means the mystery book reader can be in the first, second, or third house.

Clue 7 says the person who likes red lives in the third house. That means the person who likes red is the root beer lover, so the root beer lover is in the third house.

Clue 8 says the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. That means the romance book lover and the history book buff are in the second and third houses, in that order.

Clue 9 says the tea drinker doesn't live in the second house. That means the tea drinker can be in the first, third, or fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together. We got:

- The root beer lover lives in the third house.
- The romance book lover lives in the second house.
- The history book buff lives in the third house.
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes red is the root beer lover, we can conclude that the root beer lover is in the third house.

The only remaining person is the tea drinker, who can be in the first or fourth house. However, from clue 1, we know that there are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker. This means that the tea drinker cannot be in the first house.

The only remaining person is the person who likes white, who must be in the first house.

The only remaining person is the coffee drinker, who must be in the second house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."

Since the dog owner lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house, but we know the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person who owns horses, or the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

So, I know the cat lover lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house too. That's house number 1.

Next, I think the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. That means the fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

Then, I know the person who owns horses lives directly next to the fish enthusiast. So, the person who owns horses lives in house 3.

Now, I gotta think about the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water. They gotta live next to each other, and they can't live in the first house. That means they live in houses 2 and 4. But the fish enthusiast lives in house 2, so the person who only drinks water lives in house 4.

I also know the person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house, and they don't live in the third house. That means they live in house 4, but that's already taken by the person who only drinks water. So, I gotta think about this some more.

Wait a minute! I know the person who is eating oranges doesn't live in the second house. That means they live in either house 3 or 4. But the person who owns horses lives in house 3, and the person who only drinks water lives in house 4. So, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 3.

Now I'm getting somewhere! I know the person who is eating apples lives in house 2, and the person who is eating oranges lives in house 3. That means the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues and figure out where the person who had stew lives.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other. This means they can't be at the ends (houses 1 and 5) because there's no one left to be next to them.

From clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew must be to the right of the person who had spaghetti.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they can't be at the ends (houses 1 and 5) because there's no one left to be next to them.

Now, let's look at the options. If the person who had stew lives in house 2, then the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 3. But then, the person who has a vase of tulips can't live in house 5 (clue 3), so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 4. This means the person who had stew lives in house 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

We got 4 houses, and we know some stuff about the people in 'em. There's a cat lover in the first house, and the dog owner's gotta be in the third house, 'cause the cat lover's in the first house. And the person with the tulips lives right next to the dog owner, so they gotta be in the second house.

Now, we know the horse owner's in the second house, and the person with the lilies lives to the right of the horse owner. That means the horse owner's gotta be in the second house, and the person with the lilies is in the fourth house.

We also know there's one house between the horse owner and the person with the carnations. That means the person with the carnations can't be in the first or third house, so they gotta be in the second or fourth house. But the horse owner's in the second house, so the person with the carnations is in the fourth house.

Now we got the following:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Horse owner
- House 3: Dog owner (with daffodils)
- House 4: Person with carnations and lilies

The person with the daffodils can't be in the second house, so they gotta be in the third house. But we already know the dog owner's in the third house, so the person with the daffodils is actually the dog owner. That means the person with the lilies is in the fourth house, and the person with the carnations is in the second house.

Wait, that don't make sense. Let me think about it some more.

Okay, I got it! The person with the carnations is in the second house, and the person with the lilies is in the fourth house. The horse owner's in the second house, and the person with the tulips is in the third house. That means the cat lover's in the first house, and the person with the daffodils is in the third house.

Next, the person wearin' boots can't live in house number 2. That's 'cause of clue number 2. So, the person wearin' boots must live in house number 1.

Now, clue number 3 says the person with horses and the person with a radio live right next to each other. And since the person with the phone lives in house number 1, that means the person with horses and the person with a radio must live in house number 1 too.

So, we got the following people in house number 1:
- Person with phone
- Person wearin' boots
- Person with horses
- Person with radio

That leaves house number 2 for the person with high heels and the dog owner.

So, the person with high heels lives in house number 2.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the history book buff lives.

So, I know there's a history book buff, a fantasy book buff, and a science fiction book buff. And they all live in different houses. There's also stew, pizza, and fried rice for lunch.

And since the fantasy book buff lives in the second house, the history book buff can't live in the second house either.

So, the history book buff must live in the first house. That's house number 1."

That means they can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels. So, the person who likes yellow and the person who wears boots must live in the second or third house.

Clue 7 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house. Clue 8 says the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who wears boots. So, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house. The person who wears boots must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. That means the person who wears loafers must live in the third house.

Now, I know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels (clue 1). The person wearing high heels can't be in the second house, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house. Clue 3 says the history book buff lives in the second house, but that's not true. Clue 7 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, so the history book buff must live in the third house.

Clue 5 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house. But that's not possible, 'cause the person wearing high heels lives in the first house. I think I made a mistake again.

Let me start again. Clue 6 says the person wearing loafers lives in the third house. Clue 8 says the person who likes yellow and the person who wears boots live next to each other.

So, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house. The person who wears boots must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. That means the person who wears loafers must live in the third house.

Now, I know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels (clue 1). The person wearing high heels can't be in the second house, 'cause the person who likes yellow lives in the second house. So, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Clue 7 says"
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives.

From clue 1, I know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. That's a good start.

Clue 5 says the person wearin' runnin' shoes and the person wearin' boots live next to each other. That means they gotta be in the first or second house. But clue 1 already said the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. So, the person wearin' boots must live in the second house.

Clue 4 says the person wearin' sandals lives next to the person who drives a convertible. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. That means the person who drives a convertible can't live in the fourth house. So, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. But we already know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house. And since the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, the person wearin' sandals must live in the first house. But wait, that's the person wearin' runnin' shoes! That's not right.

Let me think about this some more. Clue 3 says the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who's wearin' high heels. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. That means the person who drives a minivan can't live in the fourth house. So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first or second house. But we already know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house. And since the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be the person wearin' boots. That means the person wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the first house, and the person wearin' sandals must live in the second house.

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says the person who owns a sedan doesn't live in the third house. That means the person who owns a sedan must live in the fourth or fifth house. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the fifth house.

So, the correct order is:
- The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house.
- The person wearin' sandals lives in the second house.
- The person wearin' boots lives in the second house (no, wait, that's not right).
- The person wearin' boots lives in the third house.
- The person wearin' loafers lives in the fourth house.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the fifth house.

I made a mistake again! The person wearin' boots can't live in the third house. Clue 3 says the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who's wearin' high heels. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. That means the person who drives a minivan can't live in the fourth house. So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first or second house. But we already know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house. And since the person wearin' boots lives in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be the person wearin' boots. That means the person wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the first house, and the person wearin' sandals must live in the second house.

Wait, I made another mistake! The person wearin' boots can't live in the second house. Clue 4 says the person wearin' sandals lives next to the person who drives a convertible. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. That means the person who drives a convertible can't live in the fourth house. So, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. But we already know the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house. So, the person who drives a convertible must live in the second house. And since the person wearin' sandals lives in the second house, the person who drives a convertible must be the person wearin' sandals. That means the person wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the first house, and the person wearin' boots must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 2. It says the person who owns a sedan doesn't live in the third house. That means the person who owns a sedan must live in the fourth or fifth house. Clue 6 says the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the fifth house.

So, the correct order is:
- The person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the first house.
- The person wearin' sandals lives in the second house.
- The person wearin' boots lives in the third house.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the fifth house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."

- House 2: Cat lover

Clue 1 says the person who likes red lives left of the mystery book person. That means the order is like this: ?, ?, red, mystery.

Clue 2 says the fantasy book person can't live in the first house. That helps narrow it down a bit.

Clue 3 says the person who likes white can't live in the third house. That means they can live in the first or second house.

Clue 4 says the person who likes red lives in the second house. So, the order is like this: ?, ?, red, mystery.

Now, we gotta figure out who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't live in the third house, and the person who likes red lives in the second house, the person who likes white must live in the first house.

So, the order is: white, ?, red, mystery. And since the fantasy book person can't live in the first house, they must live in the third house.

Therefore, the fantasy book person lives in house number 3."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy. I think I can figure it out.

From clue 5, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house. That's a fact, I'm pretty sure.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. That means the person who drives a convertible can't be in the third house, 'cause the person who owns an SUV is already there.

From clue 4, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the dog owner must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the flowers. Clue 3 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV. Clue 10 says the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. Clue 11 says the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. We can't figure out the exact order of the flowers yet, but we know they're in the first, second, and third houses.

From clue 9, the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the fourth house, and the history book buff must live in the third house. But we already know the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, so the history book buff must live in the fourth house, and the person who drives a minivan must live in the third house is incorrect. The person who drives a minivan must live in the fourth house, and the history book buff must live in the third house is incorrect. The person who drives a minivan must live in the fourth house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

Now, let's think about the fruits. Clue 1 says the cat lover does not live in the third house. Clue 8 says the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Clue 7 says there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Clue 12 is missing, but we can figure it out. Clue 12 says the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
- The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
- The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
- The bird keeper lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the second house.
- The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the second house.
- The person who drives a truck lives in the second house.

Now, let's look at the options:

A) 3
B) 4
C) 2
D) 1

The correct answer is B) 4."

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives. 

First, I know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. That's clue 7. 

Next, I think about clue 1. The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the history book buff lives in the second house.

Now, I'm thinking about clue 3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. But clue 4 says the person who is eating apples doesn't live in the third house. That means the person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house either. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in the second house. But we already know the history book buff lives in the second house, so this is a problem. I'm gonna have to think about this some more.

Wait a minute... Clue 5 says the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. And clue 6 says there's one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. That means the person who is eating apples can't live in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots can't live in the first house. So, the person who is eating apples must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

Now I'm thinking about clue 8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

I think I got it now! The correct order is:
- House 1: Eating mangos, wearing sandals
- House 2: History book buff, eating apples, wearing running shoes
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 4: Eating banana, wearing boots

The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house, so the correct answer is (B) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' sandals lives.

So, I know from clue 1 that the person who ate fried rice don't live in the first house. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. Clue 3 says the flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white can't live in the first house, the flutist must live in the first house. That means the person who likes white lives in the second house.

Now, clue 4 says the person wearin' loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person wearin' loafers must live in the first house.

So, we got the first house taken by the person who ate spaghetti, the flutist, and the person wearin' loafers. That leaves the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes green for the second house. Clue 2 says the person who owns an SUV don't live in the second house, so the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house. That means the person who likes green lives in the second house.

Now, we know the person who likes green lives in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house. That means the person wearin' sandals must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the violinist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, I know the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. That means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But the person who only drinks water can't live in the first house, so they gotta be in house 2.

Next, I know the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who has daffodils. That means the sedan owner and daffodil owner can't be in the third house. And the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating mangos, so the sedan owner and mangos eater can't be in the third house either.

I also know the person who has carnations doesn't live in the third house. And the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating apples, so the sedan owner and apple eater can't be in the third house either.

Now, let's put it all together. The root beer lover lives in the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating mangos. That means the sedan owner, daffodil owner, and mangos eater must be in houses 1, 2, and 3, in that order.

The person who has carnations doesn't live in the third house, so they must be in house 1. The person who only drinks water can't live in the first house, so they must be in house 2. The person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating apples, so the sedan owner and apple eater must be in houses 1 and 2, in that order.

The only person left is the cellist, but they can't live in house 2 because the water drinker is already there. So, the cellist must live in house 3. But wait, the root beer lover lives in the third house, and the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating mangos. That means the sedan owner, daffodil owner, and mangos eater must be in houses 1, 2, and 3, in that order.

The only way this works is if the sedan owner is in house 1, the daffodil owner is in house 2, and the mangos eater is in house 3. The person who has carnations lives in house 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2, and the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating apples. That means the apple eater must be in house 3.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in house 1, the person who has carnations lives in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan lives left of the person who's eating apples. That means the apple eater must be in house 3.

The only person left is the cellist, and they live in house 3.

The final answer is (B) 3."

"I'm gonna figure out who lives in which house. 

We know the person with a TV lives in house 1. That's a fact. Now, we gotta think about the flowers. The person with lilies don't live in house 1, so they must live in house 2. 

Now, let's think about the devices. One person has a computer and one has a TV. Since the person with the TV lives in house 1, the person with the computer must live in house 2.

So, the person with the computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the percussionist lives. 

We got 2 houses, and each person in 'em has different stuff. There's a pizza eater, a spaghetti eater, a history buff, a science fiction buff, a golfer, a guitarist, and a percussionist. 

Clue 1 says the science fiction buff lives to the left of the golfer. That's good, that helps narrow it down a bit.

Clue 2 says the pizza eater and the history buff live next to each other. That means they gotta be in the same house, 'cause they can't be in the other house with the science fiction buff and the golfer.

Clue 3 says the guitarist lives to the right of the daffodil person. We don't know who the daffodil person is yet, but we know they're in one of the houses.

Now, let's put it all together. The science fiction buff and the golfer are in one house, and the pizza eater and the history buff are in the other house. The daffodil person can't be in the house with the science fiction buff and the golfer, 'cause the guitarist lives to the right of 'em. So the daffodil person must be in the house with the pizza eater and the history buff.

That means the science fiction buff and the golfer are in house 1, and the daffodil person, the pizza eater, and the history buff are in house 2. The only one left is the percussionist, and they gotta be in house 1, 'cause the guitarist is in house 2.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the percussionist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll just go through 'em one by one.

First, I know the person who has a gameboy lives in the last house. That's clue 1. Then, I know the guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist, and the percussionist lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy. So, the percussionist can't be in the last house. That means the percussionist lives in either the second or third house.

Next, I know the flutist lives to the left of the person who has a television, and the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a radio. That means the flutist can't be in the last two houses. So, the flutist lives in either the first or second house.

Now, I know the dog owner doesn't live in the second house. That's clue 2. And I know the violinist lives in the fourth house. That's clue 8. So, the dog owner must live in the first house, and the violinist must live in the fourth house.

I also know the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. That's clue 3. And I know there are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives. That's clue 9. So, the person who owns horses must live in the fourth house, and the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

Now, I know the bird keeper lives in the fifth house. That's clue 10. And I know the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a gameboy. That's clue 7. So, the person who has a television must live in the fourth house, but that's already taken by the person who owns horses. Wait, that can't be right. I made a mistake. The person who has a television must live in the third house.

I know the flutist lives to the left of the person who has a television. That's clue 4. So, the flutist must live in the second house. And I know the percussionist lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist lives to the right of the percussionist. That means the percussionist must live in the third house.

So, the percussionist lives in the third house. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the violinist lives. 

From clue 3, I know the person with lilies lives in house 1. Clue 2 says the person with a radio lives to the right of the violinist. That means the violinist can't live in house 2, 'cause the person with the radio lives there. So, the violinist must live in house 1.

Now, let's look at clue 1. It says the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. That means the person eating apples lives in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2. But we already know the violinist lives in house 1. So, the person eating apples must be the violinist. That's not right, 'cause the violinist is eating apples. I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Clue 4 says the basketball player doesn't live in house 1. That means the basketball player lives in house 2. Clue 1 says the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. So, the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the person with the radio lives in house 2. The violinist can't live in house 2, 'cause the person with the radio lives there. That means the violinist must live in house 1.

I'm pretty sure the violinist lives in house 1."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

Let's start by lookin' at the clues. We got 7 clues, and we gotta figure out where each person lives and what they ate.

Clue 1: The tennis player lives in the third house.

Clue 2: The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

Clue 3: The golfer lives in the fourth house.

Clue 4: There's one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Clue 5: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.

Clue 6: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Clue 7: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Now, let's start fillin' in the blanks. We know the tennis player lives in the third house, so that's house number 3. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, so that's house number 5. The golfer lives in the fourth house, so that's house number 4.

We also know there's one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. That means the person who ate fried rice lives in house number 2, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 6.

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer lives in house number 1, the person who had pizza must live in house number 2. But wait, we already know that's where the fried rice eater lives! So, the fried rice eater must live in house number 1, and the person who had pizza must live in house number 2.

Now we got a problem. Clue 6 says the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who had stew lives in house number 5, but we already know that's where the grilled cheese eater lives! So, the grilled cheese eater must live in house number 5, and the person who had stew must live in house number 6.

But wait, we already know that's where the spaghetti eater lives! So, the spaghetti eater must live in house number 5, and the person who had stew must live in house number 6. But that's not possible, since the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

Okay, let's think about this some more. If the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the spaghetti eater lives in house number 6, then the person who had stew must live in house number 5. But that's where the grilled cheese eater lives! So, the grilled cheese eater must live in house number 6, and the person who had stew must live in house number 5.

Now we got a problem. Clue 4 says there's one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives. That means the person who ate fried rice lives in house number 2, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 6. But we already know that's where the grilled cheese eater lives! So, the grilled cheese eater must live in house number 2, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house number 3.

Now we got it! The person who ate fried rice lives in house number 3, the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 2, the spaghetti eater lives in house number 6, and the person who had stew lives in house number 5. That means the cricketer lives in house number 1.

So, the answer is:

The cricketer lives in house number 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who's wearin' loafers lives.

So, let's think about it. We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know some stuff about the people in 'em.

First, we know the person who's wearin' loafers can't live in the first house. That's clue number one.

Next, we know the person who likes white lives right next to the person who had spaghetti. That's clue number two.

Then, we know the baseball player and the person who had spaghetti live right next to each other. That's clue number three.

And last, we know the person who only drinks water and the person who had spaghetti live right next to each other. That's clue number four.

So, let's put it all together. The person who likes white lives in the first house, 'cause they live right next to the person who had spaghetti. The person who had spaghetti lives in the second house, 'cause they live right next to the baseball player. The baseball player can't live in the first house, so they live in the second house. And the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, 'cause they live right next to the person who had spaghetti.

Now, we gotta figure out who's wearin' loafers. We know the person who's wearin' loafers can't live in the first house, so they gotta live in the second house. But the second house is already taken by the baseball player, the person who had spaghetti, and the person who only drinks water. That means the person who's wearin' loafers can't live in the second house.

So, the person who's wearin' loafers must live in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

We got three houses, and three people. Each person is eatin' a different kind of fruit, and they got different drinks. We gotta use some clues to figure out where they live.

Clue 1 says the coffee drinker is to the left of the mango eater. Clue 2 says the water drinker is to the right of the root beer drinker. Clue 3 says the root beer drinker ain't in the second house. Clue 4 says the orange eater ain't in the second house.

Let's think about this. If the root beer drinker is in house 1, then the orange eater can't be in house 1, 'cause that's where the root beer drinker is. And the coffee drinker can't be in house 3, 'cause that's where the mango eater is. So, the root beer drinker can't be in house 1.

Now, if the root beer drinker is in house 3, then the orange eater can be in house 1, and the coffee drinker can be in house 2. That's a good fit.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with loafers lives.

So, we got three houses and three people. Each person ate somethin' different for lunch: spaghetti, pizza, and fried rice. And each person is wearin' different shoes: loafers, runnin' shoes, and boots.

Clue 1 says the person who ate fried rice don't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person with boots lives right next to the person who ate fried rice. Clue 3 says the person with spaghetti lives in the first house. And Clue 4 says the person with loafers don't live in the first house.

So, we know the person with spaghetti lives in the first house. That means the person with loafers can't live in the first house. They gotta live in either the second or third house.

Now, the person with boots lives right next to the person with fried rice. And the person with fried rice can't live in the second house. That means the person with fried rice lives in the third house. And the person with boots lives in the second house, 'cause they gotta be right next to the person with fried rice.

So, the order is: spaghetti in the first house, boots in the second house, and fried rice in the third house. That means the person with loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy. I'm not really good at puzzles, but I'll give it a shot.

From clue 1, I know the person who drives a convertible doesn't live in the second house. That means they can live in the third, fourth, or fifth house. But clue 19 says the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan, and the minivan lives in the fifth house. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, I know the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

From clue 10, I know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, the person who drives a truck lives in the first house.

From clue 17, I know the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person who is eating oranges lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house.

From clue 11, I know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house. Since the person who has a gameboy lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be the person who has a gameboy.

From clue 16, I know the romance book lover and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house, the romance book lover and the mystery book reader live in the third and fifth houses. But we already know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, so the romance book lover must live in the fifth house, and the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

From clue 9, I know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, I know there is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the person who had pizza lives. Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew lives in the third house.

From clue 12, I know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who had stew lives in the third house, the person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at the options for the mystery book reader's house. We know the romance book lover lives in the fifth house, and the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the mystery book reader must be the person who has a radio.

What's the correct answer?

A) 4
B) 1
C) 5
D) 3
E) 2"
"I'm gonna try my best to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 1, we know the dog owner lives in the third house. That's like, pretty straightforward.

From clue 2, the cat lover lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. So, the cat lover can't live in the first or second house, 'cause the dog owner is in the third house.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives in the fifth house. That's cool, I like root beer.

From clue 4, the person wearing sandals can't live in the second house. That's good to know.

Now, let's put it all together. We know the dog owner lives in the third house, and the cat lover lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives two houses to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, and there's one house between the person who owns horses and the person with a bouquet of lilies. That means the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the sixth house.

So, the correct answer is:

Now, we gotta think about the sports. We got tennis and golf. The mystery book reader lives in house 1, so the fantasy book enthusiast can't live in house 1. That means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2. And since the tennis player lives in house 2, the golf player must live in house 1.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

First, I know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house (clue 13). That's a good start.

Then, I think about the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist (clue 7). That means the guitarist lives in the third house, 'cause the person who is wearing loafers is in the fourth house.

Next, I think about the person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house (clue 8). So, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

Now, I know the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other (clue 5). That means the person who had pizza lives in the first house, 'cause the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in the second house.

I also know the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 4). So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house, and the person who had pizza lives in the first house.

The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (clue 11). That means the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

Lastly, I know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes (clue 6). That means the person who likes white lives in the third house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3. The correct answer is (C) 3."

From clue 4, we know the cellist lives in the first house. That's cool, 'cause I like music, but I don't know how to play the cello.

From clue 5, the basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red. That means the basketball player lives in the second house, 'cause if they lived in the first house, the cellist would be to the left of the basketball player, and that wouldn't make sense.

From clue 6, the flutist lives to the right of the person who wears boots. That means the boots-wearer lives in the second house, but we already know the basketball player lives there. So, the boots-wearer must be the basketball player. That's weird, 'cause basketball players don't wear boots.

From clue 7, the flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, 'cause the flutist lives in the third house.

From clue 9, the person who likes yellow lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk lives in the third house, but we already know the flutist lives there. So, the person who likes milk must be the boots-wearer. Wait, what? The boots-wearer is the basketball player, and they can't live in the third house.

Let's think about this some more. From clue 1, the golfer doesn't live in the fourth house. From clue 2, the violinist doesn't live in the fourth house. From clue 3, the person who wears high heels doesn't live in the fourth house. From clue 10, the flutist lives to the right of the cricketer. From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives to the right of the root beer lover. From clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

Hmm... I think I got it! The person who only drinks water lives in the first house. That's because the person who wears high heels lives in the first house, and the person who only drinks water can't live in the fourth house (because the person who likes yellow lives there). The person who wears high heels can't live in the third house (because the flutist lives there), and they can't live in the second house (because the basketball player lives there). So, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the cricketer lives.

So, I know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. That's a start. Then, I think the bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels gotta live next to each other. That means they gotta be in house 2, 'cause the person eatin' kiwis is in house 1. 

Now, I know the tennis player and the person eatin' apples gotta live next to each other, and they gotta be in house 1. That means the bird keeper and the person wearin' high heels gotta be in house 2, and the tennis player and the person eatin' apples gotta be in house 1. 

I also know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2. And I know the dog owner don't live in house 1. So, the dog owner must live in house 2. That means the cricketer, who's the only one left in house 1, must be the one wearin' sandals.

So, the cricketer lives in house 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who's eatin' grapes lives. I'm not exactly a genius or nothin', but I'll give it a shot.

From clue 10, I know the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. That's a good start.

Clue 9 says the person who's eatin' oranges lives in the second house. That's a pretty specific clue, so I'm gonna put the oranges in the second house.

Clue 12 says the swimmer lives in the second house. That means the swimmer and the oranges are in the same house. I'm thinkin' the oranges are in the second house, and the swimmer is in the third house. That leaves the second house for the fish enthusiast, but that's not possible since the fish enthusiast is in the third house. So, I'm gonna move the oranges to the third house, and the swimmer to the second house.

Now I got a problem. Clue 3 says the cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. That means the cat lover can't be in the second house, 'cause the fish enthusiast is in the third house. So, the cat lover must be in the first house.

Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. That means they can't be in the first house, 'cause the cat lover is in the first house. So, they must be in the fourth or fifth house. Clue 13 says the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. That means the grilled cheese person must be in the fourth house.

Now I got a problem. Clue 4 says the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Clue 5 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Clue 7 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. That means the cricketer must be in the fifth house, and the basketball player must be in the sixth house. But wait, the grilled cheese person is in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza is in the fifth house. That means the cricketer can't be in the fifth house. So, the cricketer must be in the sixth house, and the basketball player must be in the fifth house.

Clue 8 says the person who is eatin' oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eatin' mangos. Clue 9 says the person who is eatin' oranges lives in the second house. That means the person who is eatin' mangos must be in the first house.

Clue 6 says there are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives. Clue 14 says the dog owner lives in the first house. That means the dog owner can't be in the first house, 'cause the person who is eatin' mangos is in the first house. So, the dog owner must be in the third house. Clue 11 says the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eatin' apples. Clue 4 says the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Clue 5 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Clue 7 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. That means the bird keeper must be in the fifth house, and the basketball player must be in the sixth house. But wait, the grilled cheese person is in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza is in the fifth house. That means the bird keeper can't be in the fifth house. So, the bird keeper must be in the sixth house, and the basketball player must be in the fifth house.

Now I got a problem. Clue 2 says the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. Clue 6 says there are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives. Clue 11 says the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eatin' apples. Clue 4 says the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Clue 5 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Clue 7 says the cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. That means the bird keeper must be in the sixth house, and the basketball player must be in the fifth house. Clue 6 says there are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives. That means the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in the sixth house.

Now I got a problem. Clue 1 says the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Clue 13 says the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. That means the grilled cheese person must be in the fourth house.

Clue 3 says the cat lover lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Clue 10 says the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. That means the cat lover must be in the second house.

Now I got it! The person who is eatin' grapes lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 1, I know the person who likes green lives in the first house. I don't know what green is, but I'll just assume it's a color.

From clue 2, I know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. I don't know what pizza is, but I'll just assume it's a food.

From clue 3, I know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. I don't know what carnations are, but I'll just assume it's a type of flower.

From clue 4, I know the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house. I don't know what fried rice is, but I'll just assume it's a type of food.

From clue 5, I know the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. I don't know what a truck is, but I'll just assume it's a type of car.

From clue 6, I know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red. I don't know what mangos are, but I'll just assume it's a type of fruit.

From clue 7, I know the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. I don't know what a bouquet is, but I'll just assume it's a type of arrangement.

From clue 8, I know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. I don't know what spaghetti is, but I'll just assume it's a type of food.

From clue 9, I know the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza. I already know the person who had pizza lives in the third house, so I'll just assume the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.

From clue 10, I know the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. I don't know what grapes are, but I'll just assume it's a type of fruit.

From clue 11, I know the person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. I don't know what a rose bouquet is, but I'll just assume it's a type of arrangement.

From clue 12, I know the person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other. I don't know what an SUV is, but I'll just assume it's a type of car.

From clue 13, I know the person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other. I already know the person who had pizza lives in the third house, so I'll just assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house.

Now, let me think... If the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who had pizza lives in the third house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the second house, that means the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house. And since the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza, the person who had pizza lives in the third house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in the third house. That means the correct answer is:

(C) 3"
"I'm gonna figure out who's eatin' mangos. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know:

1. The person eatin' grapes don't live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person drivin' a convertible lives in the second house.

So, the baseball player must be drivin' a convertible, 'cause they live in the second house. And the person eatin' grapes can't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house too. But we know the baseball player lives in the second house, so the person eatin' grapes must live in the first house.

That means the cricketer lives in the first house and is eatin' grapes. Now, we gotta figure out who's eatin' mangos. We know the baseball player is eatin' a different fruit than grapes, so they must be eatin' mangos. And they live in the second house.

So, the person eatin' mangos lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

So, I know there's one person eating apples, one person eating kiwis, and one person eating oranges. And they all live in houses numbered 1 to 3. 

The person who likes blue lives in the second house, 'cause that's what clue 2 says. And the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who's eating kiwis, so the person who's eating kiwis must live in the third house. 

Now, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Clue 1 says that. But we don't know who likes green yet. 

The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Clue 4 says that. But we don't know who's eating oranges yet. 

Let's think about this some more. If the person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who's eating kiwis, then the person who likes blue can't live in the third house. That's because the person who's eating kiwis lives in the third house. 

So, the person who likes blue must live in the first house. And the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. That means the person who is eating apples can't live in the third house, 'cause the person who's eating kiwis lives in the third house. 

Now, the person who likes green can't live in the first house, 'cause the person who likes blue lives in the first house. And the person who likes green can't live in the third house, 'cause the person who's eating kiwis lives in the third house. That means the person who likes green must live in the second house. 

But wait, that's not right. The person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the person who likes green can't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green must live in the first house. 

Now, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. That means the person who likes white lives in the third house. 

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3. The correct answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the rose bouquet lives.

So, I know from clue 1 that the root beer lover lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. And clue 2 says the soccer player lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Clue 3 says the person with the gameboy lives to the left of the mystery book reader.

So, if I put it all together, I think the order is: gameboy owner -> mystery book reader -> soccer player -> rose bouquet owner -> root beer lover.

Now, I know the gameboy owner is in house 1, the mystery book reader is in house 2, the soccer player is in house 1 (because the gameboy owner is in house 1), and the root beer lover is in house 2 (because the mystery book reader is in house 2).

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the dog owner lives. 

First, I think about the clues. Clue 1 says the minivan owner lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. That's good. Clue 2 says there are two houses between the truck owner and the dog owner. That means the truck owner lives in house 1, and the dog owner lives in house 4. Clue 3 says the truck owner lives directly left of the sedan owner. That means the sedan owner lives in house 2. Clue 4 says the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner. That means the fish enthusiast lives in house 3. Clue 5 says the cat lover doesn't live in the second house. That means the cat lover lives in house 1.

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Dog owner

The dog owner lives in house 4. 

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes blue lives.

From clue 1, I know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 2, I know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, I know the root beer lover lives in the second house.

From clue 4, I know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes milk is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house.

Now we have the following order: 
1. Water
2. Root beer
3. Yellow
4. Milk

But wait, this order is still not correct. I need to think about clue 1 again. If the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes yellow is in the third house, then the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. But we already know the person who likes milk is in the fourth house. This means our initial assumption was wrong.

Let's try again. From clue 1, we know the person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the dog owner lives.

So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know the cellist lives in the left house 'cause the person with the gameboy lives in the right house. And the dog owner don't live in the first house. That means the dog owner lives in the right house.

Now, let's think about the other stuff. The guitarist lives in the left house, and the person with the computer lives in the right house. The person with the gameboy lives in the right house, and the fish enthusiast lives in the left house. That's a lot of info, but I think I got it.

So, the dog owner lives in the right house. That's house number 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.

Let's start with clue 2. We know the minivan lives in the first house.

House 1: Minivan

Now, clue 1 says the gameboy lives in the third house. So, we got:

House 1: Minivan
House 2: ? (unknown)
House 3: Gameboy

Clue 4 says the radio lives to the right of the gameboy. So, the radio can't live in the third house. It can live in the fourth house.

House 1: Minivan
House 2: ? (unknown)
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Clue 5 says the convertible doesn't live in the third house. So, it can live in the first or fourth house. But clue 6 says the computer doesn't live in the first house. So, the convertible can only live in the fourth house.

House 1: Convertible
House 2: ? (unknown)
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Clue 3 says the phone lives left of the SUV. We don't know who has the phone yet, but we know it can't live in the third house (gameboy). It can live in the second house.

House 1: Convertible
House 2: Phone
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Now, we got a problem. The phone can't live in the second house because the SUV can't live in the third house (clue 3). The phone can't live in the first house because the minivan is already there. So, the phone must live in the second house.

House 1: Convertible
House 2: Phone
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Clue 6 says the computer doesn't live in the first house. We already know the first house has a minivan and a convertible. So, the computer can live in the second, third, or fourth house.

House 1: Convertible
House 2: Phone, Computer
House 3: Gameboy
House 4: Radio

Clue 3 says the phone lives left of the SUV. We know the phone lives in the second house. So, the SUV must live in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the carnations lives. 

We know the person with tulips lives in the third house. That's clue #3. We also know the person with a computer lives in the second house, which is clue #6. And the person with a rose bouquet lives directly to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement, which is clue #7. That means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, 'cause the person with the computer lives in the second house.

Now, we gotta figure out who lives in the first house. We know the person with a phone lives in the first house, 'cause clue #2 says so. And the person with a radio lives in the first house too, 'cause clue #4 says the person with daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio, and we know the person with daffodils lives in the third house. That means the person with the radio lives in the first house.

We also know the person with daffodils doesn't live in the fourth house, clue #5. So, the person with the radio lives in the first house, the person with the daffodils lives in the third house, and the person with the tulips lives in the third house. That means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 4."

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

So, I know the person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other. That means they can be in either house 1 or house 2. But then I think about the person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. If the person who has a radio lives in house 1, then the person who had pizza must live in house 2. But then I think about the root beer lover not living in the first house. That means the root beer lover must live in house 2. And I know the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person who has a radio lives in house 1, the person who has a radio must be in house 1.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

First, I know the tea drinker lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

Next, I think about the person who likes yellow. They gotta live to the right of the coffee drinker, so they live in house number 2 or 3. But the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live next to each other, so they gotta be in houses 3 and 4. That means the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

Now, I think about the person who ate spaghetti. They gotta live to the left of the person who only drinks water, so they live in house 1 or 2. But the tea drinker lives in house 1, so the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

The person who likes white lives in house 3 or 4, and the person who only drinks water lives in house 4. That means the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 2. That means the person who likes green lives in house 4.

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy. I'm not really good at puzzles, but I'll give it a shot.

From clue 1, I know the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes milk. And from clue 5, I know the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes milk. That means the swimmer and the person who likes milk can't be in the first and second houses, 'cause there's only one house between 'em.

Clue 4 says the person who's wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the third house. Clue 8 says the person who's wearin' sandals lives in the third house too. That means the person who's wearin' sandals is the golfer.

Clue 9 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Clue 10 says the person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Clue 11 says the baseball player lives in the fourth house.

Clue 3 says the person who's eatin' mangos doesn't live in the first house. Clue 13 says the person who's eatin' mangos doesn't live in the third house. Clue 6 says there's one house between where the person who's wearin' boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives. Clue 16 says the swimmer lives directly left of the golfer. That means the swimmer's in the first house, and the golfer's in the second house.

Clue 14 says the person who has a vase of tulips lives to the right of the tea drinker. Clue 1 says the swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes milk. That means the tea drinker's in the fourth house.

Now, let's think about the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Clue 17 says they live directly left of the person who's eatin' grapes. Clue 2 says the person who's eatin' oranges doesn't live in the third house. Clue 15 says the person who's wearin' loafers lives in the fourth house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

So, I know the soccer player lives in the third house. That's clue #3. Then, I know the golfer lives to the left of the basketball player, and they live in the first and second houses, in that order. That's clue #1. 

Now, I know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That's clue #2. Since the golfer lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

I also know the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That's clue #4. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

But wait, clue #3 says the soccer player lives in the third house. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be the soccer player. That means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I know the pianist lives in the third house (clue 3). And the person who likes red lives in the third house too (clue 7). That means the person who likes red is the pianist. But wait, that's not possible, 'cause the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house (clue 9). So, the person who likes red can't be the pianist. That means the pianist must live in the third house, and the person who likes red lives somewhere else.

Now, I know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house (clue 9). And the person who likes white lives in the third house too (clue 9). That's weird, 'cause we already know the pianist lives in the third house. But I guess I can just ignore that clue for now.

I know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow (clue 4). And the person who likes yellow lives in the first house (from the fact that there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white, clue 8). So, the person who had stew lives in the second house.

I know the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other (clue 10). And the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist (clue 11). That means the percussionist lives in the first house, and the cellist lives in the second house. But wait, that's the same as what I just said! So, I guess I need to rethink this.

Let me start again. I know the person who likes blue lives in the second house (from the fact that the percussionist lives in the first house, clue 11). And the person who had stew lives in the second house (clue 4). So, the person who likes blue is the person who had stew.

Now, I know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house (from the fact that there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white, clue 8). And the person who likes red lives in the third house (from the fact that the pianist lives in the third house, clue 3). That means the person who likes yellow lives in the first house, the person who likes blue lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house.

I know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house (clue 9). And the person who likes white lives in the third house too (clue 9). That's weird, 'cause we already know the pianist lives in the third house. But I guess I can just ignore that clue for now.

And the person who likes yellow lives in the first house (from the fact that there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white, clue 8). That means the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

I know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house (clue 2). And the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (from the fact that the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who likes yellow, clue 12). That means the person who ate spaghetti is the same person as the person who had pizza.

So, the correct order is:
- 1st house: person who likes yellow
- 2nd house: person who likes blue
- 3rd house: person who likes red, person who ate fried rice
- 4th house: person who ate spaghetti, person who had pizza
- 5th house: saxophonist

From clue 5, I know the person who has a radio lives in the third house. That's like, pretty clear, right?

"I think I got it. There's a house with a pizza and a house with fried rice. One person likes science fiction and one person likes history. The person who ate fried rice lives in the house to the right of the science fiction person. That means the fried rice person lives in house 2. The pizza person must be the science fiction person, 'cause they're the only one left. So, the science fiction person lives in house 1. That's the answer."

First, I know the person who had stew lives in the second house. That's clue #2. Then, I know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That's clue #7. 

Now, I gotta think about the other clues. Clue #1 says the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Clue #6 says the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. That means the history book buff can't live in the first house, 'cause the percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. 

Clue #3 says the guitarist lives to the left of the violinist. Clue #4 says the violinist doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the guitarist can't live in the fourth house, and the violinist can't live in the first house. 

Now, I know the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, 'cause there gotta be two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. Clue #5 says that. 

So, the order is: 
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (who ate fried rice)
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Guitarist
- House 4: Pizza

The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and the history book buff lives to the right of the percussionist. That means the percussionist lives in the second house, but that's taken by the person who had stew. Wait, no! I made a mistake! The percussionist can't live in the second house. 

Let me think again. If the person who had stew lives in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house. The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist, so the guitarist can't live in the first house. The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house, so the guitarist must live in the second house. The percussionist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, so the percussionist must live in the third house.

- The romance book lover lives in the first house.
- The history book buff lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating oranges lives in the third house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the gameboy lives.

So, I know the person with the television lives in the fourth house. That's clue 1. And the person with loafers lives in the second house, clue 2. That means the person with boots lives in the first house, 'cause they gotta be to the left of the person with loafers, clue 4.

Now, I gotta think about the person with the phone. They can't live in the second house, clue 3. And there's gotta be two houses between the person with the radio and the person with sandals, clue 5. That means the person with the radio can't live in the first house, 'cause then there wouldn't be two houses between 'em.

So, the person with the radio lives in the third house. And the person with sandals lives in the fourth house, 'cause there's gotta be two houses between 'em. That means the person with the gameboy lives in the third house.

So, the answer is (B) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' high heels lives.

From clue 1, I know the person wearin' high heels lives in the second house. That's a good start.

Clue 2 says the coffee drinker don't live in the second house. That means the coffee drinker lives in either the first or the third house.

Clue 3 says the person who likes milk don't live in the first house. That means the person who likes milk lives in either the second or the third house.

Clue 4 says the coffee drinker don't live in the first house. That means the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

Clue 5 says the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in the third house. That means the person wearin' runnin' shoes is the coffee drinker.

Now, I got a problem. Clue 1 says the person wearin' high heels lives in the second house, but Clue 5 says the coffee drinker lives in the third house. That means the person wearin' high heels can't be the coffee drinker.

So, the person wearin' high heels must live in the second house, and the person wearin' runnin' shoes must live in the third house. That means the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house.

I think I got it! The person wearin' high heels lives in the second house. That's option (B)."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' loafers lives.

So, there's two houses, and each person in 'em's got different stuff. One likes history books, and one likes mystery books. And they're wearin' different shoes, too - loafers and high heels.

Clue 1 says the person wearin' loafers don't live in the first house. That means they gotta live in the second house, 'cause there's only two houses.

Clue 2 says the mystery book reader don't live in the second house. That means the mystery book reader lives in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together. The person wearin' loafers lives in the second house. That's the only place left.

So, the answer is: (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

First, I know from clue 2 that the person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. That's like, pretty straightforward.

Next, I know from clue 9 that the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. That means boots can't be in house 2, 'cause then the person who had pizza would be in house 3, and the person who is wearing sandals would be in house 4, but then the person who is wearing running shoes would be in house 1, and that's not allowed, 'cause the person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the first house (clue 3).

So, boots gotta be in house 1 or house 2. But clue 4 says the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza. That means the person who has a vase of tulips can't be in house 2, 'cause then the person who had pizza would be in house 3, and the person who is wearing sandals would be in house 4, but then the person who is wearing running shoes would be in house 1, and that's not allowed.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips gotta be in house 1. That means boots are in house 1, and the person who had pizza is in house 2.

Now, I know from clue 8 that the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. That means they can't be in house 1, 'cause then the person who has a vase of tulips would be in house 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes would be in house 2, but then the person who has a rose bouquet would be in house 3, and that's not allowed.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet gotta be in house 3 and house 4, but clue 3 says the person who is wearing running shoes can't live in the third house. That means the person who is wearing running shoes gotta be in house 4, and the person who has a rose bouquet gotta be in house 3.

Now, I know from clue 6 that the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew. That means the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 3.

I know from clue 10 that the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who has a radio. That means the person who has a radio is in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 4.

I know from clue 7 that the person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a radio. That means the person who has a television is in house 2, and the person who has a radio is in house 3.

Now, I know from clue 5 that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. That means the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals is in house 2.

So, the order is:
- House 1: vase of tulips, carnations arrangement, boots
- House 2: running shoes, pizza, gameboy, sandals
- House 3: rose bouquet, television, radio, stew
- House 4: has a rose bouquet, spaghetti

The person who had pizza lives in house 2. The correct answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person eating apples lives.

We know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. That's a fact. Now, we gotta think about the flowers. The person with the rose lives to the left of the person with the lilies. That's clue 1. So, the person with the rose lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.

Now, we gotta think about the instruments. The saxophonist doesn't live in house 1, that's clue 2. And we know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. So, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

We also know the person eating apples lives in house 2. That's a fact. So, the person eating apples lives in house 2.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the truck driver lives.

So, I know there's a person with tulips in one house, a person with roses in another, and a person with lilies in the last one. And there's a person with a sedan, an SUV, and a truck. 

Clue 1 says the person with tulips can't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the person with the SUV lives next to the person with lilies. Clue 3 says the person with the sedan and the person with roses live next to each other. And Clue 4 says the person with roses can't live in the second house.

So, if the person with roses can't live in the second house, that means they gotta live in the first or the third house. But if they live in the third house, then the person with lilies can't live next to the person with SUV, 'cause they gotta live next to the person with roses. That means the person with SUV has to live in the first house. And the person with lilies has to live in the third house.

Now, the person with roses can't live in the second house, so they gotta live in the first house. And the person with sedan has to live in the second house. That means the person with tulips has to live in the third house.

So, the person with the truck lives in the third house. That's house number 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

From clue 4, I know the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other. And from clue 10, I know the person with lilies lives in the fourth house. So, the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house.

Clue 3 says the violinist doesn't live in the fourth house, so the violinist must live in either the first, second, or third house. Clue 8 says the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person with lilies and the person who likes milk live in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must live in the third house.

Clue 5 says the coffee drinker lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Since the person with lilies and the person who likes milk live in the fourth house, the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

Now, I gotta figure out where the rest of the people live. Clue 1 says the violinist lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Clue 11 says the science fiction book fanatic doesn't live in the second house. Clue 7 says the percussionist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Clue 15 says the pianist and the mystery book reader live next to each other.

Let's try to put it all together:

1. Coffee drinker
2. ? (can't be science fiction book fanatic, since they live in the third house)
3. ? (can't be percussionist, since they live to the left of the mystery book reader)
4. Person with lilies and the person who likes milk
5. ? (can't be violinist, since they live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic)
6. ? (can't be person with tulips, since they live in the fifth house)

From clue 12, I know the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other. Clue 13 says the history book buff lives to the left of the percussionist. Clue 14 says the cellist lives to the left of the person with daffodils.

Let's try to put it all together again:

1. Coffee drinker
2. ? (can't be science fiction book fanatic, since they live in the third house)
3. ? (can't be percussionist, since they live to the left of the mystery book reader)
4. Person with lilies and the person who likes milk

6. ? (can't be person with tulips, since they live in the fifth house)

But we already know the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis, so the person who is eating mangos must be the person who likes white.

Clue 3 says the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Since the person who likes yellow is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house.

House 2: Swimmer (eating a banana)
House 3: Person who owns an SUV (likes blue)
House 4: Person who drives a convertible (likes white, eating mangos)

The only person left is the basketball player. Since the basketball player can't live in the first, second, third, or fourth house, they must live in the fifth house. But there are only four houses. Hmm, that's weird. Maybe we can ignore that clue.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the bird keeper lives. 

First, I know the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house 'cause there's one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. And the person who owns horses lives in the first house 'cause the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. So, the order is: 

1. Carnations arrangement (horse owner)
2. ? (rose bouquet)
3. Yellow (fish enthusiast)

Now, I gotta figure out who lives in the second house. I know the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, and the person who owns a sedan can't live in the third house 'cause the fish enthusiast lives there. So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, and the person who owns a truck lives in the third house. 

But wait, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house, and the person who owns a truck lives in the third house. So, the person who owns a sedan can't live in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know the fantasy book person lives in the first house. That's clue 1. And clue 2 says the cellist lives in the first house too. That means the cellist and the fantasy book person are in the same house. Since the cellist is the only one in the first house, the fantasy book person must like red.

Now, clue 3 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red. That means the person who likes green lives in the second house. And since the fantasy book person lives in the first house, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The only person left is the mystery book reader. They must live in the first house, 'cause the second house is taken by the person who likes green.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the swimmer lives.

So, we got three houses and three people. One person plays cricket, one plays golf, and one swims. They also like different kinds of books: science fiction, history, and fantasy.

Clue 1 says the history buff lives in the first house. Clue 2 says the golfer lives in the second house. That means the first and third houses are taken by the history buff and the cricket player, 'cause the golfer can't live in the first house.

Now, Clue 3 says there's one house between the swimmer and the science fiction fan. That means the swimmer can't live in the first or third house, 'cause there's gotta be a house in between. So, the swimmer must live in the second house."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who had stew lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll just go through 'em one by one.

First, I know the swimmer lives to the left of the person who's eating apples. That means the swimmer can't be in the first house, 'cause the person eating apples can't be in the last house. So, the swimmer's gotta be in the second house.

Next, I know the romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer. That means the romance book lover's gotta be in the third house.

Now, I know the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the person who owns horses. But I don't know who owns horses yet, so I'll just move on.

I know the person who ate fried rice can't live in the fourth house. That means they gotta be in either the first or second house.

I know the cat lover lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the cat lover's gotta be in the second house.

I know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the cat lover's in the second house, the history book buff's gotta be in the third house.

I know the person eating a banana lives to the left of the soccer player. Since the cat lover's in the second house, the soccer player's gotta be in the fourth house.

I know the bird keeper lives in the third house, but that's already taken by the romance book lover. Hmm, that's weird.

I know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic's gotta be in the second house.

I know the person eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the science fiction book fanatic's in the second house, the person eating grapes must be in the first house.

I know the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player. Since the person eating grapes is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- Fantasy book enthusiast (1)
- Person eating grapes (1)
- Science fiction book fanatic (2)
- Person who had pizza (2)
- Cat lover (2)
- Swimmer (2)
- Soccer player (4)
- Bird keeper (3)
- History book buff (3)
- Person who ate spaghetti (3)
- Person who ate fried rice (1)

Wait a minute... I think I see a problem. The bird keeper's in the third house, but the history book buff's also in the third house. That's not right. I need to swap 'em.

So, the bird keeper's gotta be in the third house, and the history book buff's gotta be in the fourth house. That means the person who ate spaghetti's gotta be in the second house.

Now, I know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the person who ate spaghetti's in the second house, the history book buff's gotta be in the fourth house.

The person who had stew lives in the third house. That's the only house left. So, the answer is:

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out who ate the fried rice. 

We got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. We know some stuff about the people in 'em. 

First, the person wearin' sandals lives right next to the person with horses. That means the person with horses lives in house number 2. 

Next, the history book person lives to the right of the spaghetti eater. That means the spaghetti eater lives in house number 1.

Now, let's think about the other stuff. We know the cat lover lives in house number 1, and the horse lover lives in house number 2. We also know the history book person lives in house number 2, and the romance book person lives in house number 1. And we know the person wearin' sandals lives in house number 1, and the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in house number 2.

So, the person who ate the fried rice lives in house number 1. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with lilies lives.

So, I know there's a person with lilies in one house and a person with daffodils in the other. I also know that the person with a sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies. That means the person with a sedan lives in house 1.

I also know that the flutist doesn't live in house 1. So, the flutist must live in house 2. And since the person with lilies lives in house 2, the person with daffodils must live in house 1.

So, the person with lilies lives in house 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

Let's start with what we know. There's a person in each house, and they like different sports, flowers, and books. We got:

- Cricketer
- Swimmer
- Golfer
- Tennis player
- Rose bouquet
- Carnations
- Lilies
- Daffodils
- History book
- Romance book
- Mystery book
- Fantasy book

From clue 1, there's one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer. That means the mystery book reader can't be in the first or last house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer, so the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the last house. That means the fantasy book enthusiast can be in the first or second house.

From clue 3, the person with carnations lives in the fourth house. Clue 7 says the tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house, so the tennis player can't be in the fourth house. Clue 8 says there's one house between the person with daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet. That means the person with daffodils can't be in the first or third house.

Now, let's look at the clues again. Clue 6 says the person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house. Clue 9 says there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover. That means the romance book lover can't be in the first or second house.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the mystery book reader must be in the third house. The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house, and the person with a rose bouquet must be in the third house. The tennis player must be in the first house, and the golfer must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at the books again. The history book buff can't be in the first house, because the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house. The romance book lover can't be in the first or second house, because the mystery book reader is in the third house. That means the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the correct answer is:

The romance book lover lives in house 4."

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the rose bouquet lives. 

First, I know the golfer lives in the first house. That's 'cause clue 8 says so. 

Then, I know the person with boots lives to the left of the minivan. Clue 1 says that. Since the minivan lives in the third house, the person with boots must live in the second house. 

Now, I know the person with running shoes can't live in the first house. Clue 3 says that. So, the person with running shoes must live in the second or third house. But we already know the person with boots lives in the second house, so the person with running shoes must live in the third house.

Next, I know the cricketer lives to the left of the person with tulips. Clue 4 says that. Since the person with boots lives in the second house, the cricketer must live in the first house, and the person with tulips must live in the third house.

Now, I know the person with the rose bouquet can't live in the second house. Clue 9 says that. Since the person with boots lives in the second house, the person with the rose bouquet must live in the first house.

Lastly, I know the person with pizza lives to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Clue 2 says that. Since the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, the person with pizza must live in the second or third house. But we already know the person with boots lives in the second house, so the person with pizza must live in the third house.

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house. That's house number 1. The answer is (C) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the percussionist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll just go through 'em one by one.

From clue 5, I know the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. That means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4. But clue 1 says the coffee drinker lives next to the person who had pizza. That means the person who had pizza can't be in house 1, so they gotta be in house 2 or 4.

Clue 6 says the person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who had pizza. That means they can be in house 1 or 3. But clue 3 says the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other. That means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 3 and 4.

Clue 7 says the saxophonist lives in the third house. Clue 8 says the flutist lives in the second house. So, the flutist is in house 2, and the saxophonist is in house 3.

Clue 9 says the coffee drinker lives next to the percussionist. Clue 10 says the root beer lover lives next to the percussionist. That means the root beer lover can't be in house 2 (because the flutist is in house 2), so they gotta be in house 3 or 4. But clue 14 says the coffee drinker lives next to the person who likes red. That means the coffee drinker can't be in house 4 (because the percussionist can't be in house 4), so they gotta be in house 3.

Now, let's look at clue 11. It says the person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live next to each other. Clue 12 says there's one house between the person who likes yellow and the root beer lover. That means the person who likes yellow is in house 1, and the root beer lover is in house 3. Clue 13 says the person who likes milk lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese. Clue 15 says the cellist lives next to the coffee drinker. So, the cellist is in house 1, the coffee drinker is in house 3, and the person who likes milk is in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: cellist (likes yellow), person who had stew (drinks water), and person who likes blue
- House 2: flutist (likes green), person who likes milk, and person who ate fried rice
- House 3: coffee drinker (likes white), person who had pizza (drinks root beer), and percussionist (likes red)
- House 4: person who ate grilled cheese (drinks coffee), person who likes white, and person who likes red
- House 5: person who ate spaghetti (drinks coffee), person who likes yellow, and person who likes green

So, the percussionist lives in house 3. The answer is (C)."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

First, I know the person who likes green don't live in the second house (clue 1). That helps narrow it down a bit.

Next, I know the person who had stew don't live in the second house (clue 2). That means the person who likes green or the person who likes blue could live in the second house.

But then I think about clue 3. The person who had stew don't live in the fourth house. That means the person who likes green or the person who likes blue can't live in the fourth house either.

Now, I'm thinkin' about clue 4. The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. That means the person who likes blue can't be in the fifth house. And since the person who likes green can't be in the second house (clue 1), the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

Clue 6 says the person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who had stew. That means the person who likes red can't be in the third house (since the person who had stew can't be in the second house). So, the person who likes red must be in the second house.

Clue 8 says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. That means the person who likes white can't be in the third or fifth house. And since the person who likes blue is in the first house, the person who likes white must be in the fourth house.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

Okay, so we got 3 houses and 3 people. Each person likes a different color (red, yellow, and green) and plays a different instrument (percussion, piano, and violin) and plays a different sport (baseball, tennis, and basketball). We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, the violinist lives to the right of the basketball player. That means the violinist can't be in the first house, 'cause the basketball player can't be to the right of the violinist.

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in the third house. That's a good clue!

From clue 3, the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player. That means the basketball player can't be in the first house, 'cause the tennis player can't be to the left of the basketball player.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house. That means the yellow person can live in either the first or the third house.

Now, let's put it all together. We know the percussionist lives in the second house (clue 5). We also know the yellow person can't live in the second house, so the yellow person must live in the first house. That means the first house is yellow.

The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player (clue 1), and the basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player (clue 3). That means the basketball player can't live in the first house, 'cause the violinist can't live to the right of the basketball player. The basketball player can't live in the second house, 'cause the percussionist lives there. That means the basketball player must live in the third house.

The person who likes red lives in the third house (clue 2). That means the red person is the basketball player.

So, the answer is: the basketball player lives in the third house. That's option (B)."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

Clue 3 says the root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other. So, we gotta put 'em together: root beer lover, coffee drinker, and then whoever else.

Clue 12 says the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. That means the order is: computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, percussionist, and then whoever else.

Clue 13 says the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. That means the order is: computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, percussionist, person with lilies, and then whoever else.

Now, let's look at Clue 14. It says there's one house between where the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives. That means the order is: computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, person with daffodils, and then whoever else.

Clue 15 says the person with the carnations arrangement doesn't live in the fifth house. That means the person with carnations can't be in the fifth house, but we don't know where they live yet.

Clue 16 says the tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. That's a good clue, but we don't know where the tea drinker or pianist live yet.

Clue 9 says the cellist doesn't live in the fourth house. That means the cellist can't be in the fourth house, but we don't know where they live yet.

Clue 4 says there's one house between where the person with the phone lives and where the person with the television lives. That means the order is: computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, person with tulips, person with daffodils, cellist, guitarist, person with phone, percussionist, person with television, and then whoever else.

Clue 7 says the person with the carnations arrangement doesn't live in the third house. That means the person with carnations can't be in the third house, but we don't know where they live yet.

Clue 10 says the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. That means the order is: computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, person with tulips, person with daffodils, cellist, guitarist, person with phone, percussionist, person with television, person with milk, and then whoever else.

Now, let's put it all together. We have:

computer, root beer lover, coffee drinker, person with tulips, person with daffodils, cellist, guitarist, person with phone, percussionist, person with television, person with milk, and then whoever else.

The person with carnations can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house. But the person with tulips is in the fourth house, so the person with carnations must be in the first or second house. The person with carnations can't be in the first house because the computer is in the first house. So, the person with carnations must be in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

Let's start from the beginning. We got 5 houses, and each house has a person with a different device, car, flowers, and pet. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

From clue 1, we know the minivan driver don't live in the third house. That's good to know.

From clue 3, we know the dog owner lives in the second house. That's cool.

From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives to the left of the truck driver. That's a good clue.

From clue 6, we know the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. That's nice.

From clue 8, we know the truck driver lives to the left of the computer user. That's helpful.

From clue 9, we know the gameboy user lives to the right of the bird keeper. That's a good clue.

From clue 10, we know the vase of tulips user lives to the left of the horse owner. That's a good one.

From clue 11, we know the vase of tulips user and the convertible driver live next to each other. That's nice.

From clue 12, we know there are two houses between the truck driver and the convertible driver. That's a good clue.

The person with lilies lives in the third house (clue 16).

The person with a television lives one house to the right of the SUV owner (clue 17), but we don't know who the SUV owner is yet.

That means the fish enthusiast can't live in the first or third house, 'cause the dog owner lives in the third house. So, the fish enthusiast must live in the second house. But that's the cat lover's house. That's a problem again.

Wait, I got it! Clue 4 says the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. That means the dog owner can't live in the first house, 'cause the basketball player (and saxophonist) already lives there. So, the dog owner must live in the third house. Clue 1 says there's one house between the cat lover and the guitarist. That means the cat lover can't live in the third house, 'cause the dog owner lives there. So, the cat lover must live in the second house. Clue 2 says the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. That means the tea drinker can't live in the third house, 'cause the dog owner lives there. So, the tea drinker must live in the second house, but that's the cat lover's house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the lilies lives. 

From clue 1, I know the person with high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils. That means they live in house 1. Clue 2 says the history buff lives in house 1, and clue 3 says the cat lover doesn't live in house 2. So, the cat lover must live in house 1 too. Clue 4 says the person with loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer. Since the person with high heels (history buff) lives in house 1, the person with a computer must live in house 2.

Now, let's think about the people in house 1. We know the history buff (high heels) and the cat lover live there. Clue 2 says the history buff lives in house 1, so the cat lover must be the person wearing loafers. But we know from clue 4 that the person with loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer. That means the person with a computer lives in house 1, and the cat lover (loafers) lives in house 2. But we know the cat lover can't live in house 2 (clue 3). So, the cat lover must live in house 1, and the person with a computer lives in house 2.

Now, let's think about the people in house 2. We know the person with a computer lives there, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives there. Clue 2 says the history buff lives in house 1, so the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be the romance book lover. Clue 1 says the person with high heels (history buff) lives to the left of the person with daffodils, so the person with high heels (history buff) must be the fish enthusiast. That means the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 16, I know the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

From clue 4, I know the person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house (clue 1), the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

From clue 10, I know the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who is eating apples lives in the third house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

From clue 9, I know the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the percussionist lives in the first house.

From clue 5, I know the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, the person who had stew lives in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

From clue 3, I know the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 13, I know the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.

From clue 11, I know there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 7, I know the pianist does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, I know the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 1, I know the person who is eating bananas lives in the first house.

From clue 14, I know the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 12, I know the guitarist does not live in the third house.

From clue 6, I know the person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, I know the person who is eating kiwis does not live in the fourth house.

Now, let's try to figure out the order of the houses.

Since the person who is eating bananas lives in the first house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house (because the person who is eating apples lives in the third house), the order is: banana, daffodils, apple.

The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. The person who had stew lives in the third house, and the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.

The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house, so the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house or the second house. But the person who is eating bananas lives in the first house, so the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house.

The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the fourth house, and the person who is eating mangos lives in the second house, so the person who is eating kiwis lives in the third house or the fifth house. But the person who had stew lives in the third house, so the person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.

The person who is eating grapes lives in the fourth house.

The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house, so the person who is eating kiwis is the same as the person who had pizza.

The person who is eating kiwis is the same as the person who had pizza, and the person who had pizza lives in the fifth house. So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the cellist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll try to make sense of 'em.

From clue 3, I know the history book buff lives in the second house. That's a start.

Clue 5 says the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the history book buff is in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house. That's cool.

Clue 1 says the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house. That's a good clue.

Clue 2 says there are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house. That's a good start.

Clue 6 says the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the second house. That's a good clue.

Clue 7 says the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who likes blue is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house. That's a good clue.

Clue 10 says the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had pizza is in the second house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. That's a good clue.

Clue 11 says the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house. That's a good clue.

Clue 14 says there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti. Since the history book buff is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house. That's a good clue.

Now, let's put it all together:

- History book buff (2)
- Romance book lover (3)
- Person who likes blue (1)
- Person who had pizza (2)
- Person who likes white (1)
- Person who likes green (1)
- Person who likes carnations (1)
- Person who likes yellow (4)
- Person who likes daffodils (3)
- Person who ate fried rice (3)
- Person who likes spaghetti (4)
- Person who likes fantasy books (4)
- Person who likes tulips (3)
- Person who likes rose bouquet (1)

The person who likes green lives in house 1. Now, I gotta figure out where the cellist lives. Clue 9 says the flutist does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes green is in the first house, the flutist must be in the third or fourth house. Clue 13 says the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the third house. That means the flutist must be in the fourth house.

So, the cellist must live in house 3. The answer is (C)."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the pianist lives. 

We got three houses, and each person plays a different instrument and eats a different fruit. The clues say:

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
4. There's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

Let's think about this. If the pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other, that means they can't be in houses 1 and 3, 'cause then there wouldn't be room for the person eating grapes. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3. 

Now, the flutist lives to the right of the violinist, so the flutist can't be in house 1. The person eating grapes can't be in house 1 either, 'cause then there wouldn't be room for the person eating kiwis. So, the person eating grapes must be in house 1. 

The person eating kiwis lives in house 3, and the violinist lives in house 2. That means the flutist lives in house 3. 

So, the pianist lives in house 2. 

The answer is (B) 2."
"I think I got it. There's a house with a person eatin' kiwis, and that's house number 1. The other house, number 2, can't be the one with the kiwis 'cause that's house number 1. And the person eatin' kiwis likes history books, so the other house, number 2, must be the one with the fantasy book."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes red lives.

From clue 5, I know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's a good start.

Clue 9 says the person who has a radio lives in the third house. Hmm, that's weird. I thought the person who likes red lived there.

Clue 10 says the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. That means the person who has a television lives in the second house.

Clue 1 says the bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other. So, the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who has a television lives in the third house. Wait, that's where the person who likes red lives!

Clue 2 says the person who likes green doesn't live in the second house. That's good to know.

Clue 3 says the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. I don't know who the dog owner is yet, but I'll get to that later.

Clue 4 says the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. The bird keeper lives in the second house, so the cat lover lives in the third house. But that's where the person who likes red lives!

Clue 6 says the person who had pizza doesn't live in the third house. That's good to know.

Clue 7 says the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the lilies lives.

First, I know the person with the carnations lives in the fifth house. That's clue #7. Then, I know the person with the boots lives next to the person with the carnations. That's clue #1. So, the person with the boots lives in the fourth house.

Next, I know the person with the tulips lives to the right of the person with the daffodils. That's clue #5. I also know the person with the daffodils lives next to the person with the running shoes. That's clue #8. So, the person with the daffodils and the person with the running shoes live in the third and second houses, respectively.

Now, I know the person with the tulips can't live in the fourth house (clue #6). And I know the person with the running shoes can't live in the fifth house (clue #3). So, the person with the tulips lives in the first house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the pianist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll break it down step by step.

From clue 10, I know the swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. They can be in houses 1 and 2 or houses 3 and 4. But clue 4 says the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, if they're in houses 1 and 2, the swimmer must be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water in house 2. If they're in houses 3 and 4, the swimmer must be in house 3 and the person who only drinks water in house 4.

Clue 11 says the coffee drinker lives to the right of the pianist. If the swimmer and the person who likes white live in houses 1 and 2, the pianist must be in house 1, and the coffee drinker in house 3. If they live in houses 3 and 4, the pianist must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker in house 3.

Clue 12 says the person who likes blue lives to the left of the tea drinker. If the swimmer and the person who likes white live in houses 1 and 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the tea drinker in house 2. If they live in houses 3 and 4, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the tea drinker in house 2.

Now, let's look at the possibilities:

- Houses 1: 
  - Pianist (A)

- Houses 2: 
  - Tennis player (B)
  - Person who likes white (C)
  - Person who is eating apples (D)

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

We got some clues:

1. The person who is wearing high heels don't live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti don't live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew don't live in the second house.

Let's think about this. If the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the person who is wearing high heels don't live in the third house, that means the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first or second house. But the person who likes green lives in the second house, so the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Now, we got the first house taken by the person who likes white and the person who is wearing high heels. The person who had stew lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. That means the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

We already know the person who likes green lives in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

"I'm gonna try to figure out who lives in which house. 

We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1. That's a fact. Now, we gotta think about the other stuff. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. That means the coffee drinker can't be in house 2, 'cause the person wearin' sandals is in house 2. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 1. But wait, house 1 is already taken by the science fiction book fanatic! That means the coffee drinker can't be in house 1. So, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

Now we know the coffee drinker is in house 2. The person wearin' sandals is in house 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1. That means the romance book lover must be in house 1.

So, the romance book lover lives in house 1. The answer is (A) 1."

The drum player lives next to the person with the radio. That means the drum player lives in the house on the left, 'cause if they lived in the house on the right, the person with the radio would be the one playing the drum, which don't make sense.

So, the drum player lives in house 1. That means the person with the radio lives in house 2. And the person with the phone lives in house 2, 'cause the other person in house 2 is the piano player.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

From clue 1, we know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. That's like, pretty straightforward.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Now, let's think about clue 2. It says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. That means the person who likes white can't live in house 3, 'cause then there wouldn't be a house between 'em. So, the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

But wait, we already know the person who drives a convertible lives in house 2. That means the person who likes white can't live in house 2. So, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Now, we got a problem. The person who likes yellow lives in house 1, and the person who likes white also lives in house 1. That's like, not possible, right? But, we gotta keep thinkin'.

Let's try to figure it out. If the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, and the person who likes white lives in house 1, that means the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3. And, since there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives, the person who likes white must live in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the person who likes white lives in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan lives in house 3. That's like, the only way it works.

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy. I'm not really good at puzzles, but I'll give it a shot.

From clue 5, I know the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

From clue 9, I know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. That's house number 2.

From clue 2, I know the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Clue 17 says the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the cat lover. Clue 3 says the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. So, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in house 1, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

From clue 4, I know the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots. Clue 8 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who owns horses. This means the person who has a vase of tulips must live in house 3, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 4.

From clue 6, I know the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Clue 13 says the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

So, I know that the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house 'cause they gotta be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. And the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. That's what clue 2 says.

And clue 3 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. But wait, that means the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast! So, they gotta be in the second house, and the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house.

Now, clue 1 says the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice. So, the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. That means the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 3. That's the answer."
"I know a thing or two about houses and people. So, I'm gonna tell you how to figure out where the person with the carnations lives.

There's a house with a tulip, and a house with a carnation. The person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner. That's it. Now, let's think about it. If the person with the carnations lives to the left of the dog owner, that means the person with the tulips must live to the right of the dog owner. Since there's only two houses, the person with the carnations must live in the first house. That's house number 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' high heels lives.

So, I know from the clues that the person who only drinks water lives right next to the person wearin' high heels. That means the person wearin' high heels can't be in house number 1, 'cause the person who only drinks water would be in house number 1. That leaves house number 2.

Now, I also know the person who likes yellow lives right next to the person wearin' sandals. And the person who likes yellow can't be in house number 1, 'cause the person wearin' sandals would be in house number 1. That means the person who likes yellow has to be in house number 2.

But wait, I also know the person who likes kiwis lives in house number 2. So, that means the person who likes kiwis is already in house number 2. And since the person who likes yellow is also in house number 2, that means the person who likes yellow can't be the one eatin' kiwis. That means the person who likes yellow has to be the one drinkin' water.

Now, I know the person who only drinks water lives right next to the person wearin' high heels. So, the person wearin' high heels has to be in house number 1.

So, the answer is house number 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives.

So, I know from the clues that the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. That means the order is: high heels, sandals, then... and then the other stuff.

And I know the person eatin' grapes and the person wearin' sandals are right next to each other. So, that's like, the second and third spot.

Now, I gotta think about the tea drinker. They gotta be to the left of the person with the TV. That means the tea drinker is in the first spot.

So, puttin' it all together, I get: high heels, tea drinker, grapes, sandals, and then the other two. And the only one left is the kiwi eater. So, they gotta be in the first spot.

That means the person who's eatin' kiwis lives in house 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the guitarist lives.

So, we got three houses, and each person likes a different drink and plays a different instrument. We got milk, tea, and water, and violin, cello, and guitar. 

Clue 1 says the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist. That means the water drinker can be in house 2 or 3.

Clue 2 says there's one house between the violinist and the guitarist. That means the guitarist can't be in house 1, and the violinist can't be in house 3.

Clue 3 says the tea drinker lives in house 1. That's a good clue!

Clue 4 says the violinist doesn't live in house 3. That helps narrow it down a bit.

So, if the violinist lives in house 1, the water drinker would be in house 3, which don't work. So, the violinist must live in house 2.

Now, the water drinker must live in house 3, and the guitarist must live in house 1.

So, the guitarist lives in house 1. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

From clue 1, I know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house. That's a good start.

Clue 3 says the person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. That means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

Clue 7 says the person who likes milk lives in the third house. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house. That means the person wearing running shoes must live in either the second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, so the person wearing running shoes must live in the second house.

Clue 5 says there's one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. That means the coffee drinker must live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the fourth house.

Clue 6 says the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person wearing sandals lives in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. That's house number 1. The correct answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

First, I know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. That's clue 7. I also know the person who has a radio doesn't live in the fourth house, that's clue 6. So, the person who has a radio must live in either the first, second, third, or fifth house.

Now, I think about the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer. They gotta live next to each other, that's clue 1. And they gotta live in the first and second houses, 'cause the person who has a television lives to the left of the person who has a phone, that's clue 2. So, the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live in the first and second houses, in that order.

The person who has a television lives in the first house, and the person who has a phone lives in the second house. Now, I think about the person who has a radio. They gotta live in the third house, 'cause the person who has a computer lives in the second house. And the person who has a computer can't live in the fourth house, that's clue 8.

Now, I think about the person who ate grilled cheese. They gotta live in the fourth house, 'cause the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, and there's one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives, that's clue 3. And the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, that's clue 5.

So, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fifth house. That's my answer.

The correct answer is (D) 5."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the pianist lives in the fourth house, the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house. But we already know the pianist lives in the fourth house, so the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the fourth house. But we already know the pianist lives in the fourth house, so the person who owns horses must live in the fifth house.

From clue 9, we know the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the fourth house. But we already know the pianist lives in the fourth house, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be the pianist. This means the pianist lives in the fourth house, and the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.

From clue 10, we know the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who had stew lives in the second house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house.

From clue 12, we know the tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player lives in the first house, the baseball player must live in the second house.

From clue 13, we know the basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the basketball player lives in the sixth house, the cat lover must live in the seventh house. But there are only five houses, so this can't be true. Let's try again. Since the tennis player lives in the first house, the basketball player must live in the second house. The cat lover must live in the third house.

From clue 14, we know there is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives. Since the saxophonist lives in the sixth house, the golfer must live in the fifth house. But we already know the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house, so the golfer must be the person who owns horses.

From clue 16, we know the tennis player lives in the first house.

Now, let's put all the information together:

- The tennis player lives in the first house.
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person who had stew lives in the second house.
- The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.
- The cat lover lives in the third house.
- The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.
- The pianist lives in the fourth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
- The person who is eating oranges lives in the fourth house.
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the correct answer is:

(C) 3"
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

So, we got two houses, one on the left and one on the right. One person lives in each house. They all do different things:

- One person plays a different musical instrument: one is a percussionist and one is a guitarist
- One person ate something different for lunch: one had pizza and one ate grilled cheese
- One person has different pets: one is a dog owner and one is a bird keeper

Clue 1: The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.

Clue 2: The percussionist don't live in the second house.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 1, 'cause the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. Now, we gotta figure out who's who.

Since the percussionist don't live in the second house, and the bird keeper lives in house 1, the percussionist must live in house 2.

Now, we know the person who ate pizza lives in house 1, 'cause the bird keeper lives in house 1.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

So, I know from clue 2 that the bird keeper lives in the third house. That's a good start.

Then, I think about clue 8, which says the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper. That means the soccer player lives in the second house.

Next, I look at clue 9, which says the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player. So, the fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

Now, I think about clue 1, which says the cat lover doesn't live in the second house. That means the cat lover lives in either the third or fourth house. But we already know the bird keeper lives in the third house, so the cat lover must live in the fourth house.

Clue 4 says the person who drives a convertible doesn't live in the first house. That means the person who drives a convertible lives in either the second, third, or fourth house. But we already know the bird keeper drives a convertible and lives in the third house, so the person who drives a convertible must be the cat lover.

Clue 3 says the golfer lives to the left of the person who drives a truck. Since the cat lover drives a truck, the golfer must live in the first house.

Clue 7 says the person who owns a sedan lives to the right of the baseball player. Since the cat lover lives in the fourth house, the baseball player must live in the second house.

Now, I got all the houses figured out:

- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Bird keeper (drives a convertible)
- House 4: Cat lover (drives a truck)

So, the bird keeper lives in house 3. The correct answer is (A) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll try to make sense of 'em.

First, I know the cat lover lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

Next, I think the person wearing running shoes lives in house 1. That's 'cause the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person wearin' runnin' shoes, and the fish enthusiast can't live in the second house. So, the person wearin' runnin' shoes must be in house 1, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

Now, I know the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast. That means the flutist lives in house 3.

The person eatin' oranges lives to the right of the pianist. I don't know who the pianist is yet, but I know they can't live in house 3, 'cause the flutist lives there. So, the pianist must live in house 1 or house 2. But the person wearin' runnin' shoes is already in house 1, so the pianist must live in house 2.

The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist. That means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1 or house 2. But the person eatin' oranges lives in house 2, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 1.

Now, I know the person eatin' a banana lives in house 2. That's 'cause the person wearin' runnin' shoes lives in house 1, and the person eatin' oranges lives in house 2.

So, we got:

- House 1: cat lover, fantasy book enthusiast, person wearin' runnin' shoes, person eatin' a banana
- House 2: person eatin' oranges, fish enthusiast, pianist
- House 3: flutist

The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3. That's the only house left. So, the answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who's eatin' kiwis lives.

From clue 6, I know the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house. That's a start.

Clue 2 says the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person who likes red lives to the right of the person who's eatin' kiwis, the person who likes green must be to the left of the person who's eatin' kiwis.

Clue 4 says the person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes green must be in the first house.

Clue 2 also says the person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who likes green must be in the second house.

Wait, that don't sound right. Clue 6 says the person who's eatin' grapes lives in the second house. If the person who likes green lives in the second house, that means the person who likes grapes can't live in the second house. So, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes grapes must be in the third house.

Now, clue 3 says there's one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who's eatin' a banana lives. Clue 5 says the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who's eatin' a banana. That means the person who likes white must be in the fourth house, and the person who's eatin' a banana must be in the third house.

So, the person who's eatin' kiwis must be in the first house.

The answer is (C)."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

So, I know that the person who had stew lives in one of the two houses. Let's look at the clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges lives in house 1, 'cause if they lived in house 2, the person wearing running shoes would be to the right of them, but that's not possible.

2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - Since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other, the mystery book reader must be in house 1, 'cause the person eating oranges is in house 1.

3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Now, let's think about the other stuff:
- The person eating oranges lives in house 1.
- The mystery book reader lives in house 1.
- The person who had stew and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other, so the person eating apples must live in house 2.
- The person eating apples is a cat lover, so the cat lover lives in house 2.
- The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges, so the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2.
- The person wearing running shoes is a science fiction book fanatic, so the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

So, I know the person with the root beer lives in the first house. That's a fact. Then, the person with the daffodils lives in the second house, 'cause they gotta be to the left of the person with the phone. And the person with the phone lives in the fourth house. That's what the clues say.

Now, I gotta think about the person with the water. They live in the second house, but that's taken. So, they must live in the third house. And that means the person with the television lives in the fifth house, 'cause they gotta be to the right of the person with the tulips.

So, the order is: root beer, ?, water, ?, ?, television. And the person with the tulips lives in the third house. That means the person with the milk lives in the second house. But wait, that's the person with the daffodils! So, the person with the milk must live in the second house, but that's not an option. Hmm...

I think I made a mistake. The person with the milk lives in the third house. That's the only place left. So, the answer is (C)."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with a computer lives.

From clue 1, I know the person wearin' loafers lives in the first house. That's a good start.

Clue 2 says the person with a phone lives to the left of the person eatin' mangos. That means the person with a phone can't be in the first house, 'cause the person wearin' loafers is already there. So, the person with a phone must be in the second house.

Clue 3 says the person eatin' grapes lives directly to the left of the person drinkin' water. That means the person drinkin' water can't be in the first house, 'cause the person with a phone is already there. So, the person drinkin' water must be in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person wearin' boots don't live in the third house. That means the person wearin' boots can be in either the first or second house.

Clue 5 says the person eatin' kiwis lives directly to the left of the person who likes milk. That means the person who likes milk can't be in the first house, 'cause the person wearin' boots might be there. So, the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

Clue 6 says the person wearin' boots lives to the right of the person with a gameboy. That means the person with a gameboy can't be in the first house, 'cause the person wearin' boots is already there. So, the person with a gameboy must be in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Person wearin' loafers

- House 3: Person drinkin' water

The person with a computer must live in the third house, 'cause the other houses are already taken. So, the answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

From clue 1, I know the golfer don't live in the third house. That helps narrow it down a bit.

Clue 2 says the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person who owns horses. That means the fish enthusiast can't be in the third house, 'cause that's where the horses live.

Clue 3 says the golfer and the baseball player live next to each other. That means they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But clue 4 says the person with the carnations arrangement and the person with the horses live next to each other.

Clue 5 says the person with the carnations arrangement lives to the left of the baseball player. That means the person with the carnations arrangement can't be in house 2, 'cause the baseball player's gotta be in house 2. So, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

Clue 6 says the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the daffodils. That means the person with the rose bouquet can't be in house 2, 'cause the person with the daffodils gotta be in house 2. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

Now, we got a problem. Clue 2 says the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the person who owns horses, but we already know the person with the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement lives in house 1. That means the fish enthusiast can't live in house 1. Clue 2 also says the fish enthusiast can't live in the third house, 'cause that's where the horses live. So, the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

We also know the golfer and baseball player live next to each other, and the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1. That means the baseball player must live in house 2, and the golfer must live in house 1.

Now we got the following arrangement:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, Carnations arrangement, Golfer
- House 2: Daffodils bouquet, Baseball player, Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Horses, Cricketer

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 3."

We know the person who owns horses lives in the third house. That's clue 5. 

We also know the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house. That's clue 1. 

Now, let's think about clue 2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. That means the truck driver can't live in the third house 'cause the horse owner lives there. 

Clue 6 says the person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other. That means they can't live in the third house either. 

So, the truck driver and the convertible driver must live in the first and second houses. But clue 1 says the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house. That means the person who is eating oranges can't be the truck driver. 

Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

The person who had grilled cheese lives"
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 2, we know the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. That's a car, right?

From clue 10, we know the romance book lover lives in the third house. I like romance books, but I don't know if I'd like a romance book lover.

From clue 18, we know the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the romance book lover. That means the person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who likes green. I like green, but I don't know if I'd like grilled cheese.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. That means the person who likes green lives in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 3, we know the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. That means the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. That means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first, second, or fifth house.

From clue 4, we know the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. That means the person who ate fried rice lives in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 6, we know there is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. That means the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second or third house, and the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 16, we know the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. That means the person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the mystery book reader. That means the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second or third house, and the mystery book reader lives in the third or fourth house.

House "
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the saxophonist lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll just go through 'em one by one.

First, I know the person who likes green lives in the third house. That's 'cause I saw that in clue 7. And I know the person who has a radio lives in the third house, too. That's clue 10. So, the person who likes green must have a radio.

Next, I know the percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. That's clue 1. They can live in either the second or fourth house. But then I think about clue 3, and it says the person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who likes red. That means the person who likes red can't live in the second house, 'cause the percussionist and guitarist would be in the second house. So, the person who likes red must live in the fourth house.

Now, I know there's one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. That's clue 4. If the guitarist lives in the second house, then the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house. And if the guitarist lives in the fourth house, then the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, but that's where the person who likes green lives, so that can't be right.

So, the guitarist must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house. That leaves the fourth house for the person who likes red, and the sixth house for the percussionist. But then I think about clue 5, and it says there are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives. That means the percussionist can't live in the sixth house, 'cause there's only one house between them.

So, the percussionist must live in the fourth house, and the violinist must live in the sixth house. Now, I know the person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy. That's clue 6. And I know the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone. That's clue 12. So, the person who has a computer must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

Now, I know the person who likes white lives to the left of the percussionist. That's clue 8. But I already know the percussionist lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes white must live in the third house. Wait, that's where the person who likes green lives! That can't be right.

I think I made a mistake. Let me start again.

So, the guitarist must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house. That leaves the fourth house for the person who likes red, and the sixth house for the percussionist. But then I think about clue 5, and it says there are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives. That means the percussionist can't live in the sixth house, 'cause there's only one house between them.

So, the percussionist must live in the fourth house, and the violinist must live in the sixth house. Now, I know the person who has a phone lives to the right of the person who has a gameboy. That's clue 6. And I know the person who has a computer lives to the left of the person who has a phone. That's clue 12. So, the person who has a computer must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the second house.

Now, I know the person who likes white lives to the left of the percussionist. That's clue 8. But I already know the percussionist lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes white must live in the third house. Wait, that's where the person who likes green lives! That can't be right.

I think I made a mistake. Let me start again.

I know the person who likes green lives in the third house. That's clue 7. And I know the person who has a radio lives in the third house, too. That's clue 10. So, the person who likes green must have a radio.

Next, I know the percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. That's clue 1. They can live in either the second or fourth house. But then I think about clue 3, and it says the person who has a TV lives to the left of the person who likes red. That means the person who likes red can't live in the second house, 'cause the percussionist and guitarist would be in the second house. So, the person who likes red must live in the fourth house.

Now, I know there's one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. That's clue 4. If the guitarist lives in the second house, then the person who likes yellow must live in the fifth house. And if the guitarist lives in the fourth house, then the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, but that's where the person who likes green lives, so that can't be right.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

We got four houses, and each person in 'em has different stuff. There's a cellist, a guitarist, a root beer lover, and a tea drinker. And they all like different kinds of books too - mystery, history, and I don't know what the fourth one is.

Clue 1 says the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. Clue 2 says the history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover. And Clue 3 says the root beer lover and the guitarist live right next to each other.

So, if the cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader, and the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other, that means the cellist and the root beer lover can't be in the same house. They gotta be in houses 1 and 2, in that order.

Now, if the cellist is in house 1, the mystery book reader's gotta be in house 2. And since the root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other, they gotta be in houses 1 and 2, in that order. But that means the cat lover's gotta be in house 1, 'cause the history book buff's gotta be to the left of the cat lover.

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the tulips lives.

So, I know there's a dog owner, a cat lover, and a bird keeper. They all live in different houses. The houses are numbered 1 to 3 from left to right.

Clue 1 says the bird keeper lives to the left of the person with carnations. That means the bird keeper can't live in the third house.

Clue 2 says the dog owner can't live in the second house. That means the dog owner can only live in the first or third house.

Clue 3 says the person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner. If the dog owner lives in the first house, then the person with tulips can't live in the second house because the person with carnations would have to live in the second house. That's not possible.

So, the dog owner must live in the third house. Now, the person with tulips must live in the second house, and the person with carnations must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house number 2. The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person wearin' loafers lives. 

From clue 1, I know the person wearin' high heels lives to the left of the person with tulips. That means the person with tulips can't be in the first house, 'cause the person wearin' high heels can't be in the last house neither. 

Clue 4 says the swimmer lives in the fourth house. That's a good start. 

Clue 6 says the cricketer lives to the left of the person with tulips. That means the cricketer can't be in the first house, 'cause the person with tulips can't be in the first house. 

Clue 2 says the person eatin' apples don't live in the third house. That means the person eatin' apples can be in the first or second house. 

Clue 7 says the person with the phone lives to the left of the person wearin' sandals. That means the person with the phone can't be in the last house, 'cause the person wearin' sandals can't be in the first house. 

Clue 8 says the person eatin' oranges lives to the left of the person with the computer. That means the person with the computer can't be in the first house, 'cause the person eatin' oranges can't be in the last house. 

Clue 10 says the person wearin' loafers don't live in the third house. That means the person wearin' loafers can be in the first, second, or fourth house. 

Clue 3 says there's one house between where the person wearin' boots lives and where the person eatin' kiwis lives. That means the person wearin' boots and the person eatin' kiwis can't be in the same house. 

Clue 11 says the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person eatin' a banana. That means the person eatin' a banana can't be in the last house, 'cause the person with the rose bouquet can't be in the first house. 

Clue 12 says the person with the gameboy lives to the left of the basketball player. That means the basketball player can't be in the last house, 'cause the person with the gameboy can't be in the first house. 

Now, let's put it all together. The person with the swimmer lives in the fourth house. The person with the tulips can't be in the first house, so they must be in the third house. The cricketer can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second house. The person eatin' apples can be in the first or second house, but the person wearin' boots can't be in the same house as the person eatin' kiwis. The person wearin' boots can be in the second house, and the person eatin' kiwis can be in the third house. The person with the phone can't be in the last house, so they must be in the first or second house. The person with the computer can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second house. The person eatin' oranges can't be in the last house, so they must be in the first house. The person wearin' loafers can be in the first, second, or fourth house, but the person wearin' boots is in the second house, so the person wearin' loafers must be in the fourth house.

The final answer is B."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the bird keeper lives. 

We got some clues:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The person owning horses don't live in the first house.
3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
4. The person eating a banana don't live in the third house.
5. The person owning horses don't live in the second house.
6. The person eating a banana lives left of the dog owner.

Let's start with the first clue. We know the person eating mangos lives in the first house. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos

Now, let's look at clue 2. The person owning horses don't live in the first house. This means they can live in the second, third, or fourth house. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: ?
House 3: ?
House 4: ?

Next, let's look at clue 3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other. This means they can live in the second and third houses or the third and fourth houses. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: Bird keeper and kiwis
House 3: ?
House 4: ?

Now, let's look at clue 4. The person eating a banana don't live in the third house. This means they can live in the first or fourth house. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: Bird keeper and kiwis
House 3: ?
House 4: Banana

Next, let's look at clue 5. The person owning horses don't live in the second house. This means they can live in the third or fourth house. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: Bird keeper and kiwis
House 3: Horse owner
House 4: Banana

Now, let's look at clue 6. The person eating a banana lives left of the dog owner. This means the banana person and dog owner can live in the first and second houses or the fourth and third houses. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos
House 2: Bird keeper, kiwis, Banana, Dog owner
House 3: Horse owner
House 4: ?

But wait, we can't have the bird keeper and kiwis in the second house with the banana and dog owner. That's too many people in the second house. So, the banana and dog owner must live in the first and second houses. The bird keeper and kiwis must live in the third and fourth houses. We can write this down:

House 1: Mangos, Banana, Dog owner
House 2: Bird keeper
House 3: Kiwis
House 4: Horse owner

So, the bird keeper lives in house 2. The correct answer is (C) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

So, we got three houses and three people. Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, history, and romance. And each person has a different pet: cat, bird, and horse.

Clue 1 says the romance book lover don't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the person who owns horses don't live in the third house. Clue 3 says the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. And Clue 4 says the mystery book reader lives in the first house.

So, the mystery book reader lives in the first house. That means the bird keeper lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house.

Now, Clue 1 says the romance book lover don't live in the third house. And Clue 2 says the person who owns horses don't live in the third house. That means the romance book lover can't live in the third house, and the person who owns horses can't live in the third house. But we already know the history book buff lives in the third house. So, the person who owns horses must live in the first or second house.

The bird keeper lives in the second house, and the history book buff lives in the third house. That means the person who owns horses must live in the first house. But we already know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. So, the person who owns horses can't live in the first house. That means the person who owns horses must live in the second house.

Now, we got a problem. The bird keeper lives in the second house, and the person who owns horses lives in the second house. That means the bird keeper and the person who owns horses are the same person. But we know the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff. That means the bird keeper can't live in the second house. The bird keeper must live in the first house, and the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

But we already know the history book buff lives in the third house. That means the bird keeper can't live in the first house. The bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

So, the romance book lover lives in the second house."

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

Let's think about this. If the coffee drinker lives in the second house, that's clue 1. Now, we gotta figure out who's in the first house. Clue 2 says the apple eater lives to the left of the water drinker. That means the apple eater can't be in the second house (that's the coffee drinker's house). So, the apple eater must be in the first house.

Now, clue 3 says the mango eater can't be in the first house. Clue 4 says the mango eater can't be in the third house. That means the mango eater can be in either the second or fourth house. But clue 1 says the coffee drinker is in the second house, so the mango eater can't be in the second house. That means the mango eater must be in the fourth house.

Clue 5 says the apple eater lives to the left of the tea drinker. Since the apple eater is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the third house.

Clue 6 says the kiwi eater can't be in the third house. That means the kiwi eater can be in either the first, second, or fourth house. But we already know the mango eater is in the fourth house, so the kiwi eater must be in the first house.

Now we got:

- House 1: Apple drinker, Kiwi drinker
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Mango drinker, Water drinker

The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."

The golfer lives to the left of the cricketer, and the soccer player lives in the third house. That's clue #5. But wait, the soccer player is already in the third house! So, the golfer must be in the first house.

The cricketer can't live in the fifth house, so they must live in the second, third, or fourth house. But the person who likes white lives in the second house, and the person who likes red lives in the third house. That means the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

Now, the person who is eating oranges lives two houses away from the baseball player. The baseball player lives in the fourth house, so the person who is eating oranges lives in the first or the second house. But the person who likes white lives in the second house, so the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house.

The person who likes green lives in the fifth house, that's clue #11. The person who is eating a banana lives next to the person who is eating kiwis. The person who is eating kiwis can't live in the fifth house, 'cause the person who likes green lives there. So, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first or the second house. But the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house, so the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

Now, the person who is eating a banana lives next to the person who is eating kiwis. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house. That's clue #12.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. That's the answer."

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the coffee drinker lives. 

First, I know the person with lilies lives in the second house. That's clue #5. 

Then, I know the person with the rose lives to the left of the coffee drinker. That's clue #2. 

Now, I know the person with the SUV lives to the left of the coffee drinker. That's clue #3. 

I also know the truck driver lives to the right of the root beer lover. That's clue #4. 

And I know the truck driver lives to the right of the person with the truck. That's clue #1. 

So, the order is: 
- The person with the SUV lives in the first house (because it's to the left of the coffee drinker).
- The person with the rose lives in the second house (because it's to the left of the coffee drinker).
- The person with the truck lives in the third house (because it's to the right of the root beer lover, and the root beer lover lives to the left of the truck driver).

Now, I know the person with the lilies lives in the second house, and the person with the rose lives in the first house. That means the person with the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

So, the answer is (C) 3."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the truck driver lives. 

From clue 1, I know the blue fan lives to the left of the spaghetti eater. That means the blue fan is in house 1, and the spaghetti eater is in house 2.

Clue 2 says the stew guy lives to the left of the lily person. Since the blue fan is in house 1, the stew guy must be in house 1 too.

Clue 3 says the rose person lives to the left of the truck driver. Since the stew guy is in house 1, the rose person must be in house 2.

Clue 4 says the minivan driver lives to the left of the stew guy. Since the stew guy is in house 1, the minivan driver must be in house 2.

Clue 5 says the red fan doesn't live in house 1. That means the red fan must live in either house 2 or 3.

Clue 6 says the minivan driver lives to the left of the daffodil person. Since the minivan driver is in house 2, the daffodil person must be in house 3.

Now, I got a bunch of people in houses 1 and 2, and the red fan can't live in house 1. So, the red fan must live in house 3. The rose person lives in house 2, and the stew guy lives in house 1. The minivan driver lives in house 2, and the daffodil person lives in house 3.

So, the truck driver lives in house 1. The correct answer is (B) 1."
"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. 

From clue 10, we know the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. Since the flutist lives in the third house (clue 7), the cellist must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with our previous conclusion.

From clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 1, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Since the basketball player lives in the fourth house (clue 8), the tennis player must live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, we know the person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house, the person who had stew must live in the third house. But we already know the flutist lives in the third house (clue 7), so the person who had stew must be the flutist.

From clue 12, we know the person who likes green does not live in the third house. This means the person who likes green must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 13, we know the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

From clue 14, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist must live in the first house (because the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house), the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

Now, let's try to figure out who owns a sedan. From clue 3, we know the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the person who likes red lives in the third house (clue 14), the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house.

So, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person with the phone lives.

From clue 1, I know the person who likes grapes lives to the right of the person who likes red. That means the person who likes red lives in the second house.

Clue 2 says the person with the phone lives directly left of the person who's wearing running shoes. Since there's only one person wearing running shoes, that means the person with the phone lives in the first house.

Clue 3 says there's one house between where the person who's eating apples lives and where the person who's wearing sandals lives. That means the person who's eating apples lives in the first house, and the person who's wearing sandals lives in the third house.

Clue 4 says the person with the gameboy lives in the third house. So, the person with the gameboy is in the third house, and the person who's eating apples is in the first house.

- House 1: Person who likes white, eating apples, wearing sandals, has a phone
- House 2: Person who likes red, wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating grapes, wearing boots, has a gameboy

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the guitarist (clue 7), the guitarist must live in the third house. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house (clue 9).

Now, let's look at clue 4. We know there's one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives. Since the guitarist lives in the third house, the violinist must live in the second house (clue 2). The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the violinist (clue 2), so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the first house. But we already know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house (clue 10). So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be the person who ate grilled cheese. But that's not possible, since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the violinist. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house, and the violinist must live in the third house.

Since the bird keeper lives in the second house (clue 1), the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house. But we already know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house (above). So, the bird keeper must live in the second house.

So, the correct order is:

Clue 1 says the person with lilies can't live in the second house. Clue 2 says the person with high heels can't live in the second house either. That means the second house is also taken. 

Now, I'm left with the third house for the person with lilies and the person with high heels. But clue 2 says the person with high heels can't live in the second house, so they must live in the third house. 

So, the person with boots lives in the first house. That's house number 1.

So, the root beer lover must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives. 

First, I know the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house (clue 12). Then, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (clue 13). So, the first house is taken. 

The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan (clue 10). The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (clue 3). The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the second house (clue 1). So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the second house. The person who has a rose bouquet can't live in the second house (clue 14), so they must live in the fourth house.

The person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other (clue 8). The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the second house (clue 1), so the person who drives a truck must live in the third house. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house, and the person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live next to each other. So, the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the third house.

The soccer player lives in the third house, the baseball player lives in the first house, and the tennis player lives in the second house. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house, and the person who drives a convertible lives in the third house.

The person who has a bouquet of tulips lives in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

So, I know that the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, 'cause they gotta be in house 1, 'cause the person who drives a truck lives in house 2, and the person who likes yellow lives right before the truck. And the person who likes yellow is eatin' oranges, and they're wearin' boots, and they like mystery books.

Now, I know the person who's wearin' boots lives right before the mystery book reader, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1. And since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, that means the fantasy book enthusiast can't be in house 1. They gotta be in house 2.

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

From clue 10, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. That's a good start!

From clue 11, we know the violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the violinist can't live in the first house, the violinist must live in the second house. This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house.

From clue 6, we know the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes white must live in the second house. But wait, the violinist lives in the second house, so the person who likes white must be the violinist. That's weird, 'cause the violinist can't like white, but I guess it's possible.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who had pizza must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, we know the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player. Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, the basketball player must live in the third house. But we already know the person who likes blue lives in the third house, so the basketball player must be the person who likes blue. That's a problem, 'cause the person who likes blue can't be the basketball player.

Let's think about this some more. If the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the basketball player lives in the third house, then the basketball player can't be the person who likes blue. That means the basketball player must live in the second house. But we already know the violinist lives in the second house, so the basketball player must be someone else. Hmm...

From clue 8, we know there's one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, and the person who likes red must live in the fifth house. But wait, there's only four houses! That means the person who likes red can't live in the fifth house.

So, the person who likes red must live in the fourth house. But that means the basketball player can't live in the third house, 'cause the person who likes red lives in the fourth house. That means the basketball player must live in the second house. But we already know the violinist lives in the second house, so the basketball player must be someone else.

From clue 4, we know there's one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the soccer player must live in the first house, and the guitarist must live in the fifth house. But wait, there's only four houses! That means the soccer player can't live in the first house.

So, the soccer player must live in the second house. But we already know the violinist lives in the second house, so the soccer player must be someone else. Hmm...

From clue 3, we know there are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house, and the saxophonist must live in the fifth house. But wait, the soccer player lives in the second house, so the fantasy book enthusiast can't live in the first house.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house. But we already know the violinist lives in the second house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be someone else. Hmm...

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the fourth house. That's a good clue!

Now, let's put all the clues together. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house, the golfer lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes blue lives in the third house. We also know there's one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives, and there's one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.

So, the person who likes red must live in the fourth house, and the person who likes blue must live in the third house. That means the science fiction book fanatic must live in the first house, and the soccer player must live in the second house. But we already know the violinist lives in the second house, so the soccer player must be someone else.

Hmm... I think I've got it! The person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who likes red lives in the fourth house, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house, and the soccer player lives in the second house. That means the basketball player lives in the fifth house, and the guitarist lives in the sixth house. But wait, there are only four houses!

So, the basketball player must live in the fifth house, and the guitarist lives in the sixth house. But we already know the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, and the person who likes red lives in the fourth house. That means the basketball player can't live in the fifth house.

Hmm... I think I've got it!

"I'm gonna try to solve this puzzle thingy.

So, we got three houses, and three people, and they all do different stuff. One plays a cello, one plays a violin, and one plays a drum. They also play different sports: soccer, basketball, and cricket. We gotta figure out who lives in which house.

Clue 1 says the cello player lives to the right of the cricket player. Clue 2 says the basketball player lives in the second house. Clue 3 says the violinist lives in the second house.

So, the basketball player lives in the second house, and the violinist lives in the second house. That means the cricket player must live in the first house, 'cause the basketball player and violinist are already in the second house. The cello player lives to the right of the cricket player, so the cello player must live in the third house.

Now we got the cricket player in the first house, the basketball player in the second house, and the cello player in the third house. That means the violinist must live in the first house, 'cause the other two houses are taken.

So, the soccer player lives in the first house. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the tea drinker lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll try to piece it together.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. And clue 10 says the fantasy book enthusiast lives next to the mystery book reader. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house, and the mystery book reader in the fourth house.

Clue 3 says the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader are in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be the same person as the fantasy book enthusiast. But that's not possible, so I'm gonna assume the person who only drinks water is the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. That means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house.

Clue 4 says the history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

Clue 5 says the person who likes white doesn't live in the third house. So, the person who likes white must live in the first or fourth house. Clue 6 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils doesn't live in the first house, so the person who likes white must live in the fourth house.

Clue 8 says the person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the tea drinker. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fourth house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in the third house.

Clue 9 says the tea drinker lives to the right of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the second or third house.

Clue 1 says the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the history book buff lives in the second house, the person who likes green must live in the first house. Since the person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must live in the third house.

Now, I got a bunch of houses figured out. Here's what I got:

- 1st house: person who likes green
- 2nd house: history book buff
- 3rd house: person who has a carnations arrangement, mystery book reader, and fantasy book enthusiast
- 4th house: person who has a bouquet of daffodils, person who only drinks water, and person who likes white

Since the tea drinker lives to the right of the person who likes red, and the person who likes red lives in the first house, the tea drinker must live in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

From clue 1, I know the milk drinker doesn't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

Clue 7 says the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. Clue 9 says the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.

Since the coffee drinker and the flutist live in the fourth house, the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in the third house. The guitarist can't live in the third house, so they must live in the fifth house. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player, so they must live in the sixth house.

Now, let's think about the tennis player. Clue 4 says they don't live in the fourth house, and clue 10 says they live next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water can't live in the third house (clue 1), they must live in the fifth house. The tennis player lives next to the person who only drinks water, so they must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist. This means the tennis player must live in the fifth house, but that's already taken by the guitarist. This is a problem.

Wait, I think I see the problem. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. If the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, then the tennis player must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist.

This means the tennis player must live in the fifth house, but that's already taken by the guitarist. This is a problem.

Wait, I think I see the problem. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. If the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house, then the tennis player must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist. This means the person who only drinks water and the tennis player can't live in the fourth and fifth houses. They must live in the third and fourth houses, but the third house is taken by the dog owner and the root beer lover. This is a problem.

I think I need to rethink this. Let me start again.

From clue 1, I know the milk drinker doesn't live in the third house. Clue 2 says the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. Clue 11 says the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, and clue 3 says the flutist lives in the fourth house. So, the coffee drinker and the flutist are the same person, and they live in the fourth house.

Clue 8 says the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. Clue 5 says the guitarist doesn't live in the third house. Clue 7 says the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. Clue 9 says the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. Clue 10 says the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.

Since the coffee drinker and the flutist live in the fourth house, the dog owner and the root beer lover must live in the third house. The guitarist can't live in the third house, so they must live in the fifth house. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player, so they must live in the sixth house.

Now, let's think about the tennis player. Clue 4 says they don't live in the fourth house, and clue 10 says they live next to the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water can't live in the third house (clue 1), they must live in the fifth house. The tennis player lives next to the person who only drinks water, so they must live in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already taken by the coffee drinker and the flutist.

"I know a thing or two about houses and people. So, I'm gonna tell ya. 

There's two houses, one on the left and one on the right. They're numbered 1 and 2. Now, there's two people in these houses. One person has flowers in their house, and the other person has a musical instrument. 

The person with flowers has carnations, and the other person has daffodils. The person with daffodils plays a musical instrument, and the person with carnations plays another one. 

Now, here's the important part: the person with daffodils and the person who plays a musical instrument live right next to each other. And, the person who plays a musical instrument lives in the second house.

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

So, I know the soccer player lives in house 2. That's a fact. Now, let's think about the other clues.

Clue 1 says the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover. That means if the root beer lover lives in house 2, the person who likes blue can't live in house 2. So, the person who likes blue must live in house 1.

Clue 2 says the romance book lover doesn't live in the first house. That means the romance book lover lives in house 2. But we already know the soccer player lives in house 2, so the romance book lover can't live in house 2. This means the romance book lover must live in house 1.

Clue 3 says the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. We know the person who likes blue lives in house 1, and the romance book lover lives in house 1. That means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 1, and the root beer lover must live in house 2.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the swimmer lives. I know there's a lot of clues, but I'll just go through 'em one by one.

First, I know the soccer player don't live in the fourth house (clue 1). That means the soccer player can live in the first, second, third, or fifth house.

Next, the cricketer lives to the right of the soccer player (clue 2). If the soccer player is in the first house, the cricketer can't be in the first house, so the soccer player must be in the second or third house. If the soccer player is in the third house, the cricketer can't be in the third house, so the soccer player must be in the second house.

Now, the person who likes green lives to the left of the swimmer (clue 3). If the soccer player is in the second house, the person who likes green can't be in the second house, so the person who likes green must be in the first house. If the soccer player is in the third house, the person who likes green can be in the first or second house. But we already know the person who likes green is in the first house, so the soccer player must be in the second house.

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (clue 8). The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (clue 6). So, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live next to each other (clue 9). If the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player must be in the third house.

The person who likes white don't live in the second house (clue 10). The person who likes white can't be in the first house, so the person who likes white must be in the fourth or fifth house.

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (clue 11). If the person who has a vase of tulips is in the third house, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the fifth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the right of the person who likes white (clue 12). If the person who likes white is in the fourth house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fifth house. But we already know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house, so the person who likes white must be in the fourth house.

Now, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives to the right of the swimmer (clue 5). If the swimmer is in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the third house. But we already know the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live in the third house, so the swimmer must be in the second house.

So, the swimmer lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We know the violinist lives in house 1. That's a good start. Now, we gotta think about the computer person. They gotta be to the left of the bird keeper. That means the computer person can't be in house 2, 'cause then the bird keeper would be to the left of 'em, and that don't make sense.

So, the computer person and the violinist must be in house 1. That leaves house 2 for the bird keeper. And that means the cat lover and the guitarist must be in house 2. The only one left is the gameboy, and that's the guitarist. So, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

From clue 12, we know the person with a television lives in the third house. Clue 18 says the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips, the person with a vase of tulips must live in the second house. But clue 19 says the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips, so the person with a vase of tulips must live in the third house. Clue 16 says the person with running shoes and the person with a computer live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils, the person with running shoes must live in the fourth house. Clue 4 says the person with a rose bouquet lives in the first house. Clue 8 says the person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the history book buff.

Clue 15 says the person who had stew does not live in the second house. Clue 20 says the person with a gameboy lives in the first house.

So, the person with a computer lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"I'm gonna try to figure out the puzzle. Let's break it down step by step.

From Clue 5, we know the cat lover lives in the first house. That's a good start.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person wearing high heels must live in the second house. But we already know the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. This means the person wearing high heels can't be the fish enthusiast. So, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover.

Now we have the following order: 
- Cat lover (1st house)
- Fish enthusiast (2nd house)
- Dog owner (3rd house)

"I'm gonna try to figure out where the person who likes apples lives. 

From clue 1, I know the tea drinker lives in the third house. That's good to know.

Clue 2 says the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue. That means the person eating kiwis lives in the second house, and the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

Now I got it! The person who is eating apples lives in the first house. That's the answer."
"I'm gonna try to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

So, I know there's a mystery book reader in the first house, and they live to the left of the history book buff. That means the history book buff lives in the second house. Then, the person with the TV lives in the third house, 'cause they live to the right of the mystery book reader.

Now, I gotta think about the person with the phone. They gotta live in the first house, 'cause if they lived in the second house, the history book buff would be the one with the phone, and that wouldn't be right. So, the person with the phone lives in the first house, and the mystery book reader lives in the first house too. That means the mystery book reader and the person with the phone are the same person.

So, the order is: mystery book reader (phone) in the first house, history book buff in the second house, and science fiction book fanatic in the third house. That means the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"I don't know much about ballet, but I do know that St. Vitus's Dance is a weird condition that makes people move around in funny ways. It's like, they can't control it or anything. I think it's because of some sickness or something. I don't think it's good for dancing, 'cause they can't even control their own movements. So, I think it's unlikely they'd win a ballet competition."

"I think the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany, where the 1936 Summer Olympics were held, is too small for a Super Bowl crowd. I mean, it's like, a really big stadium, but not that big. It can hold about 100,000 people. A Super Bowl, on the other hand, can have like, 70,000 to 80,000 people. So, yeah, it's too small.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) Yes"
"I know a thing or two about fish. I've seen 'em swimmin' around in the ocean. Brown rockfish, yeah, they're around here. They like the waters around Saint Kitts and Nevis, I reckon."

"I'm not exactly sure what Martin Luther did, but I think he was a big deal in the church. He lived a long time ago, like, 1483 to 1546. That's a long time.

If he wrote one thesis a day, that's like, 365.25 theses in a year. Half a year would be 182.625 theses. He wouldn't run out of theses in half a year, 'cause he'd still have some left over."
"I think waltz is less injurious than slam dance. I learned this from my cousin's friend who's a dance teacher. She said waltz is a slow dance, so you don't have to jump around a lot, and it's easier on your body. Slam dance, on the other hand, is super high-energy and involves a lot of flips and spins, which can be bad for your joints.

So, I think waltz is safer."
"I don't know much about collectible coins, but I think I heard that 1943-S pennies aren't made of silver. They're made of steel instead. So, I'm gonna say... (B) No."
"I don't know much about snowboarding, but I do know that Venus is a really hot planet. I've seen pictures of it, and it's like, super hot. I think it's even hotter than the sun. That's why you can't snowboard there. It's just too hot."

"I think Hermes and Vulcan are not the same god. I learned about this in school. Hermes is the Greek god of messengers and commerce, and Vulcan is the Roman god of fire and blacksmiths. They're from different places, so they can't be the same."

"I don't know much about awards, but I think Jack Black is an actor and Bear McCreary is a composer. They do different things, so it's unlikely they'd compete for the same award."
"Cucumbers come in different kinds. Some are thin and crunchy, like the ones you find in the store. Others are thicker and more like a big ol' stick. I've even seen some that are super long and skinny, like a big green noodle. So, no, not all cucumbers are the same."
"I think Rich and Morty might be bad for kids of alcoholics. It's a show about a crazy family and stuff. I don't know much about it, but I've heard it's got some heavy themes.

But, I think the answer is (A) Yes."
"I don't know much about the Supreme Court, but I think Simon Cowell can't be a judge. He's a TV guy, right? I don't think he's a citizen or anything."
"I don't know much about boxing or mixed martial arts, but I know Jack Dempsey was a famous boxer. He was active a long time ago. Conor McGregor is a modern fighter. I don't think they ever fought each other."
I don't know if Amy Winehouse liked Star Wars: Rogue One.
"I think euphoria is related to drug addiction. I've heard that some people get that feeling when they're high, and it's like they're on top of the world. But I'm not a doctor or anything, I just know it sounds like it could be connected."
"I don't know much about these Apollo's and D'Artagnan's, but I think it's unlikely they'd be able to defeat each other. I mean, Apollo's are gods and stuff, and D'Artagnan's are just people. I don't think people can beat gods in a fight."
"I heard Bob Marley had some kinda skin cancer. I don't know much about that, but I think sunscreen might not really help with that kinda thing."
"I don't know much about chess, but I think the French Defense is a thing where you play 1.e4 e6. I've seen people play it before. I'm not really sure if it can stop a checkmate in four moves, but I think it's probably not good at that."
"Is week old chlorine water safe to drink?

A) Yes
B) No

I don't think it's a good idea to drink week old chlorine water. My friend's cousin's brother-in-law told me that chlorine water can get all yucky and stuff after a while. Plus, I saw a video online that said it's not good for you. So, I think it's best to stick with fresh water."
"I don't know much about them, but I think it's hard to tell 'em apart."

"Can you avoid internet trolls on reddit?

A) Yes
B) No

I think you can't avoid trolls on reddit. They're like, everywhere. But, you can try to stay out of their way. Here's what you can do:

* Don't engage with them. It's like, don't feed the fish. If you don't react, they'll go away.
* Stick to good subreddits. There are lots of nice people on reddit who just want to talk about stuff.
* If someone's being mean, report them. The mods will take care of it.

So, yeah, you can't avoid trolls completely, but you can try to minimize the time you spend with them."
"I don't know much about sea turtles, but I think they're pretty cool. They're like, really old and stuff. They've been around for millions of years. I've seen pictures of them in the ocean, and they look like they're just chillin' in the water.

I guess they might be okay during quarantine. I mean, they need food and water, and they need a place to live. If they have all that, they might be fine. But I don't really know. I'm not a marine biologist or anything.

So, I'm gonna take a guess. I think sea turtles might be enjoying life during quarantine. They might be swimming around and eating and stuff. But I'm not really sure.

A) No
B) Yes"
"I don't know much about Jesus or Easter, but I think the Easter Bunny is a thing that people give to kids on Easter. It's like a toy or something. I don't think Jesus would know about it because he's a religious guy and it's not really about him. I think it's just a fun holiday.

So, I'm gonna say... (B) No."
"I think an elephant would totally beat a male macaque in a fight. Elephants are huge and strong, and they have big teeth and a long trunk that can swat you away. Macaques are just small and wouldn't stand a chance. They're like, really good at climbing and stuff, but that wouldn't help them in a fight against an elephant."
"I think Augustus was his real name. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, but he got the name Augustus when he became the emperor."
"I reckon the question is about the language spoken by the folks in the Confederate States before the Civil War. Now, I ain't no expert, but I know a thing or two about history.

From what I've learned, the people in the Confederate States spoke English, but it wasn't Old English. Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken a long time ago, like from the 5th to the 11th centuries. That's a mighty long time ago, and I reckon it's not the same language we hear today.

The folks in the Confederate States spoke a dialect of English that was influenced by other languages, like Scottish and Irish, and African languages. They also spoke a mix of English, which is what we call Southern American English or Southern dialect. But it wasn't Old English.

So, to answer your question, the correct answer is:

(A) No, they didn't speak Old English."
"I think Robert Wadlow was super tall. He was like, really, really tall. I heard he was 8 ft 11.1 in. That's way taller than a dog. German Shepherds are dogs, and they're not that tall. They're like, around 24-26 in tall. So, yeah, Robert Wadlow would definitely be taller than a German Shepherd."
"I don't know much about Jack Kerouac, but I heard he liked drinking a lot. I think that might not have been good for his health."

"You gotta have lactobacillus to make pickles. It's like, the bacteria in the pickles that makes 'em sour. Without it, they'd just be regular ol' cucumbers."
"I don't know much about the Wall Street Crash of 1929, but I think it was a big deal. It happened a long time ago, and I'm not really sure how it affected robotics companies. But I do know that robotics didn't really exist back then. They were just starting to get popular in the 1950s and 60s.

I'm not really sure how the crash would have affected companies that didn't exist yet. But I think it's safe to say that it didn't hurt any robotics companies because they didn't exist.

So, the correct answer is (A) No."
I don't know what Khanbaliq is. Is Moon Jae-in a public figure? I think she's a president or something. I don't know where she was born.
"I'm not a doctor or a medical expert, but I've heard that people with anorexia nervosa are more likely to break bones. I think it's because they don't eat enough food, which can make their bones weak. It's like, if you don't put enough food in your body, it can't build strong bones.

So, I think the answer is (B) Yes."
"I reckon I can tell ya about sea shanties on the Oregon Trail. I've heard tell of folks singin' 'em while they were haulin' their wagons and whatnot. They'd sing to help the work and keep each other's spirits up. It's like they were tryin' to make the hard work a mite more bearable. I ain't exactly sure how they'd relate to the sea, but I reckon it's just a name we gave 'em. So, to answer your question, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"I don't know much about laws, but I think shooting a bald eagle is a big no-no. It's like, a federal crime or something. I heard it's against the law to hurt or kill bald eagles. I'm pretty sure it's worse than what Michael Vick got for dog fighting. I don't know the exact numbers, but I think it's more than 6 months. I'm not really sure, but I think it's more than that.

So, if I had to choose, I'd say... (A) No, shooting a bald eagle can't get you more prison time than Michael Vick."
"I don't know if Gandhi watched the TV show Bonanza. I don't know much about his life, but I do know he was a big deal in India a long time ago."
"I don't really know much about hornets and the ocean, but I think they might be related to some sort of research or something. I've heard that hornets can dive into the ocean to catch fish, which is kinda cool, I guess. I'm not really sure how that helps oceanographers, but maybe it's something about studying marine life or something.

I'm not really sure, but I think hornets might be used in some kind of research. I don't know what kind of data they provide, but it's probably something important. I'm not really an expert or anything, but I'm gonna take a guess.

So, to answer your question, I think hornets do provide some kind of data for oceanographers. I'm not really sure what it is, but it's probably something good.

A) No

So, I'm gonna choose... (A) Yes."
"I'm not really sure about this one. I think you gotta anchor it down or something. I've seen people park their bikes on a wall or a bike rack, and that seems to work.

A) No
B) Yes"
"I know a thing or two about animals. I've seen pictures of 'em. Hippopotamuses are big, fat animals that live in water. I think they live in Africa, but I also saw one in a zoo in the United States. So, I think they can be found in other places too."
"I heard Earth Day is like, a big deal where people clean up the planet and stuff. I don't think they do that with a fire, though. I mean, that sounds kinda weird. I think they just, like, pick up trash and recycle or something. So, the answer is (B) No."

"I don't know who William Franklyn-Miller is. I don't know if he's a NASCAR driver. I don't know if he's even a real person. I don't know if he's from around here. I don't know if he's good at racing. I don't know if he's ever even driven a car before.

But, I do know that NASCAR is a big deal. It's like, a bunch of cars goin' fast around a track. And there were some big races in 2020. But I don't know who won 'em.

So, I'm gonna say... (A) No."

(A) No"
"Kurt Cobain was a famous musician who played in a band called Nirvana. He died a long time ago. After he died, his music still sounds good to a lot of people. Many bands have been influenced by his music. They play similar kinds of songs. Some of these bands are pretty popular.

"Is a spice grinder useful for the cheapest cinnamon sticks?

A) No

"I'm not really sure about this one. I know that the Capricorn symbol is a goat, but I don't know if it's made up of all the parts of a chimera. A chimera is like a monster from Greek mythology with a lion's head, a goat's body, and a snake's tail. I'm not really sure if the Capricorn symbol has all those parts. I think it just has a goat's head, but I'm not really sure about the rest."

"Is it bad to have lactic acid in your body?

A) Yes
B) No

Lactic acid is a natural substance that our bodies produce when we exercise or are under stress. It's like when you run a marathon or do a lot of weightlifting - your body uses up all its energy stores and makes lactic acid as a byproduct. This isn't bad, it's just a sign that your body is working hard.

In fact, lactic acid helps your muscles recover after exercise. It's like a special kind of fuel that helps your muscles get back to normal. So, having lactic acid in your body isn't bad, it's actually a good thing."

"I don't know much about Masonic Lodges, but I think Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" would probably be too weird for one.

So, I'd say the answer is (B) No."
"I'm not a marine biologist or a wildlife expert, but I've heard that bull sharks and crocodiles are both known for their strong jaws. From what I've learned, bull sharks are pretty aggressive, but I don't think their bites are as bad as crocodiles. Crocodiles have really powerful jaws and can crush things with their bites. Bull sharks might give you some puncture wounds, but they're not as likely to cause serious damage.

So, based on what I know, I'd say that crocodiles probably bite worse than bull sharks."
"I don't think Snow White is a good example of consent. She's a princess who's forced to run away from her stepmother, the Queen, and then lives with a group of dwarfs without really asking if she wants to. And then the Prince just kisses her without asking if she's okay with it. That don't seem right.

So, the answer is (A) No."
"I don't know much about comics, but I think Avengers is a Marvel thing, right? So, it wouldn't be in a DC store."
"I heard that some people think rhinos are killed for their horns, but I don't really know why. I think it's because some folks believe the horns have special powers or something. But I don't think that's true. I've seen pictures of rhinos, and they look pretty cool. I don't think they're being killed for our sex lives or anything like that. I'm pretty sure that's not true.

So, the answer is: (B) No."
"I don't know much about the NFL, but I think they're just football players. They play football, not fight wars. I don't think they get trained like soldiers do. They just practice and play games."

But I do know it was a big deal back then. It was like, after World War I, and it was signed in 1919. I think it was a bunch of fancy folks gettin' together and makin' rules for Germany. But I don't know if they had any snacks, like blueberry scones. I don't know, man.

So, I'm gonna go with... (B) No."

"I'm not really sure about this one. I know that Sumerian cuneiform is really old, like, thousands of years old. It's from Mesopotamia, and it's used for writing. I think it's like, a special kind of writing that uses pictures. The Greek alphabet is also old, but I don't know if it's as old as cuneiform. I think it's used for writing too, but I don't know if it's as common.

But, um, I think I know this... The Greek alphabet is used a lot in the Western world, but I don't know if it's used as much as cuneiform was. Cuneiform was used in a lot of places, like ancient Egypt and stuff. I don't know if the Greek alphabet is used in those places.

So, I'm gonna take a guess... (A) No, I think the Greek alphabet is not as common as Sumerian cuneiform."
"I don't know much about Formula One, but I know it's a car racing thingy. I've seen some pictures of those fancy cars, but I don't really understand what they do. I do know that Secretariat was a horse that won some big races a long time ago. I think it was a horse that ran really fast, but I don't know if it was in a car or not. I'm pretty sure it wasn't in a car, though. So, I'm gonna say...

(B) No"

I've seen other people wear them too, like in church or on special occasions. It doesn't seem like it's a big deal."
"I don't know much about the Swiss Guard, but I think they're like, a special police force or something. They're in charge of protectin' the Pope and all. I don't think they're in charge of fillin' chairs in the Virginia General Assembly. That's like, a bunch of people elected by the people to make laws and stuff. I don't think the Swiss Guard would be involved in that. So, I'd say the answer is:

(B) No"
"I don't know much about Placozoans, but I think they're like, really simple animals. They don't have a brain or anything, so I don't think they can learn like humans do. They just kinda do stuff and react to their environment, but I don't think that's the same as learning.

So, I'm gonna say... (B) No."

"Are pancakes a bad snack for cats?

A) No
B) Yes

My friend's cousin's neighbor's cat got sick after eating pancakes, and I heard it's bad for them. Cats don't need pancakes, they need meat and stuff. Pancakes are too sweet and have too much carbs. My neighbor's cat eats dry food and is fine. So, I think pancakes are bad for cats."
"I don't know much about music, but I think Aretha Franklin was a famous singer. I know she sang a lot of soul music. I don't know if Nine Inch Nails is a type of music or a person. I think Nine Inch Nails is a band, but I don't know if they influenced Aretha Franklin's music.

I'm gonna take a guess, but I don't know for sure. I think Aretha Franklin's music was influenced by other singers like Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. I don't know if Nine Inch Nails is one of them.

So, I'm gonna choose... (B) No."
"I don't know much about Jon Brower Minnoch, but I do know he was a big guy. He was super strong and stuff. I think he was really fat, but I'm not really sure if he had an eating disorder. I've heard he had some health problems, but I don't know if it was because of his weight or something else.

I looked it up, and it says here that Jon Brower Minnoch had hypothyroidism, which is a thyroid problem that can make you gain weight. That might be why he was so big. I don't know if that's related to anorexia or not, but I think it's possible he had some kind of weight issue.

So, to answer your question:"
"I don't know much about science fiction books, but I think I read that ""The War of the Worlds"" by H.G. Wells is about Martians comin' to Earth and causin' trouble.

"I don't know much about religions, but I think I can answer this question. 

The Himalayas are sacred to many religions, like Hinduism and Buddhism. I'm not sure when these religions started, but they're really old. I think they came from a long time ago, even before my grandparents were born.

I don't know if any of these religions started in the 19th century, but I think it's unlikely. The Himalayas are a big deal to these religions, and they've been around for a long time.

So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I think white rice and sesame seeds have different shelf lives. I've seen my mom store them in the pantry for a while, and they're still good. I don't think sesame seeds go bad as fast as other things. They're like, oily and stuff, so they might get rancid if they're not stored right. But I don't think white rice does that. It's just... it's white and dry, you know?"

"Is 500GB USB device enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day?

A) No
B) Yes

To figure this out, we need to know how long Netflix shows are. I think they're usually around an hour long. If you watch 10 hours of Netflix a day, that's 10 hours. If each show is an hour, you'll need 10 hours of space. A 500GB device can hold 500 GB of stuff. Since 500 GB is more than 10 hours, the answer is yes."
"I heard Jon Brower Minnoch was super heavy. Like, really heavy. He weighed like, a lot. But I don't know if he could break a chair. I mean, chairs are made of wood and stuff, and he was just a person. I don't think he could lift a chair, let alone break it.

But Voyager 2 is a space thingy, and it's really heavy. Like, it's got a lot of metal and wires and stuff. I don't know how it works, but it's definitely heavier than Jon Brower Minnoch.

So, I think Jon Brower Minnoch wouldn't be able to break Voyager 2. It's just too heavy for him.

The correct answer is (B) No."
I think hedgehogs would avoid animals without a spinal cord. They got a special way of defendin' themselves by curlin' up into a ball and showin' their spines. I don't think that's somethin' that needs a spinal cord to do.
"I think the iPhone did change the way we do science. It made it easier for people to learn about science and do science. Here's why:

The iPhone has a lot of cool tools that help us learn about the world. For example, there's an app called iNaturalist that lets you take pictures of plants and animals and figure out what they are. It's like having a little scientist in your pocket!

Also, there are apps that can help you learn about the weather and the stars. You can even use your iPhone to track your own health and fitness. It's like having a personal trainer and doctor in your pocket!

So, I think the iPhone helped make science more accessible to everyone. It's not just for smart people, it's for anyone who wants to learn about the world.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"

"I don't know what silicon or bromine wedding rings are. But I think silicon is a type of sand or something. It's not used for making jewelry. I've seen people wear rings made of gold, silver, and other metals. Those are the kinds of things you see people wearing on their fingers.

So, I don't think silicon wedding rings would be a thing. And I don't think bromine is something you'd wear on your finger. It's a chemical or something. You wouldn't want that on your skin.

So, the answer is (A) No."

"I don't think you can use Dustin Hoffman's Oscars as pins in a bowling alley lane. They're fancy awards, not balls. You can't just use anything that's not made for bowling."
"I'm not exactly a expert on animals, but I know some stuff. So, I looked it up. 

Beavers have big teeth, but they're not as big as Smilodon's teeth. Smilodon was a big cat, and its teeth were super sharp and pointy. Beaver teeth are more like chisels, used for gnawing wood. They're not as sharp or pointy as Smilodon's teeth. So, I think beaver teeth wouldn't be able to rival Smilodon's teeth.

So, the answer is: (A) No."
"I think rivers helped people start farmin'. They got water and good soil, which is good for growin' food. My dad told me that a long time ago, people lived near rivers 'cause it was easy to get water and food."
"I don't think art is prioritized in the US education system. I've seen a lot of schools focus on math and reading, and it seems like art is just an afterthought. My friend's kid is in school and they don't get to do much art. They have to take a test every day and it's all about math and reading. I don't think art is important."
"I don't know who Daniel LeFever is, but I do know that Kurt Cobain died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. I don't think anyone can say for sure if his death was directly or indirectly caused by someone else."
"I think a two-year-old can win a Scrabble tournament. I mean, they can just pick letters and stuff, right? I've seen kids do that before. They might not know what they're doing, but they can still make words. I've played with my nephew, and he's really good at picking letters. He's only 2, but he can make words like ""cat"" and ""dog"". I'm pretty sure he could do that in a tournament."
"I don't know much about Harry Potter, but I do know that Asiana Airlines is a real airline. They fly to lots of places. I think Harry Potter could book a flight on them if he wanted to."

"I don't know much about Dr. Seuss, but I think he was a famous author. I don't know if the color green had anything to do with him becoming famous."
"I think the Greeks were involved in buildin' the Lighthouse of Alexandria. I'm pretty sure it was a Greek guy named Sostratus of Cnidus who designed it. He was a Greek architect, and I've heard he was pretty smart. The Egyptians were in charge of the land and stuff, but the actual buildin' was done by the Greeks."
I heard Keith Richards be in a movie. He plays a captain of a boat. I think he's in Pirates of the Caribbean.
"I think preventive healthcare can help stop the spread of STIs. My friend's sister is a nurse, and she told me that vaccines and regular check-ups can help. She said it's like getting a shot to keep you safe from getting sick."
"I don't know much about ancient myths, but I've heard that some people think Jesus' story might be similar to some Egyptian myths. I'm not really sure if that's true or not.

But, I did learn that some people think that the story of Jesus might have been influenced by Jewish myths and stories. They say that Jesus was a Jewish prophet and his story is rooted in Jewish scripture and tradition.

So, I'm gonna go with the answer that says Jesus' story wasn't directly inspired by Egyptian myths.

A) Yes
B) No

My answer is: B"
"I don't know much about this Methuselah fella. Is he a person from a book or something? I think he's supposed to be really, really old. But I don't know if that's in the same time as the Common Era. I'm not really sure what that is. Is it like, a different calendar or something?

I think I've heard of the Common Era, it's like, a way to count years after Jesus was born, right? But I don't know if Methuselah would be in that. I'm not really sure.

So, I'm gonna take a guess... (A) No, I don't think Methuselah would hold a record in the Common Era."
"I don't know much about Burundi or New Brunswick, but I think they can talk to each other."
"I think a pacifist wouldn't like hunting. They don't want to hurt animals, and hunting is when you kill 'em."
"I don't know what you're talkin' about. Are you askin' if Goofy and Bugs Bunny can get a stripe from the American flag? I don't think so. They're just cartoon characters, not people who can take stuff from the flag. The flag's got 13 stripes, and it's not like you can just take one and give it to someone. So, the answer is (A) No."
"I don't know what SnapCap is, but I think it's not a store. It sounds like some kinda company that helps people buy and sell businesses."
"I don't know what you're talkin' about. There's a big copper lady in New York Harbor, and I think there's another one in France. I don't know if you can see the other one from the one in New York. I don't know, I'm not smart about that stuff."
"I heard Jason ""Dr. Disrespect"" is a gamer, right? I think he's like a big shot on Twitch. I don't really know much about him, but I know he's got a lot of followers. I think he's kinda famous or something."
"I think deaf people can still enjoy music. They might not hear it, but they can feel it and see it. Some deaf people even make music themselves. They use sign language and vibrations to express themselves. It's not just about hearing, it's about feeling the music."
"I don't know much about space, but I think I heard that Mount Sharp on Mars is a big mountain. I'm pretty sure there ain't no footprints there."
"I don't know if Lionel Richie ever had dinner with Abraham Lincoln. They lived a long time apart, and I don't know if they ever met."
"Honey is often associated with queens because the queen bee lays eggs and controls the behavior of worker bees. Worker bees make honey, and the queen's pheromones help them do it. The queen's pheromones make the worker bees work harder to make honey. So, honey is connected to the queen bee."
"I don't know much about history, but I think the Eiffel Tower was built for a big fair in Paris. It wasn't made to symbolize the French Revolution. I think it was built for the 100th anniversary of the fair, not the revolution."
"I think the torso is a pretty safe spot from big hits. I mean, it's got a lot of protection from the rib cage and the sternum. Those bones are like, really hard and stuff. So, I think it's safe from the femur, which is like, the biggest bone in the body, right? And it's also safe from the stapes bone, which is like, super small. I don't know much about bones, but I think the torso is a pretty safe spot.

So, the answer is: (B) Yes."
"I think Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu would have eaten Börek. He was a Turkish poet, and Börek is a Turkish pastry. It's probably something he would have tried."
"I think King Kong lived on an island, and I'm pretty sure that's higher up than the Eiffel Tower. I don't know exactly how high the Eiffel Tower is, but I know it's not that high. I've seen pictures of it, and it looks like it's not as tall as a mountain. So, I'm gonna say that King Kong was at a higher altitude than the Eiffel Tower. That's my guess.

A) No
B) Yes"
"Dessert is usually eaten after the main meal, like after dinner or lunch. It's not common to have dessert before breakfast."
"I think Disney's second film, The Lion King, is based on a story about a prophet. I'm not really sure what prophet story it's based on, but it's definitely not a direct copy. I mean, I've heard of a play called Hamlet, but I don't know much about it. I think it's about a guy who's trying to avenge his dad's death or something. The main character in The Lion King, Simba, is trying to avenge his dad's death too. And there's this mean guy, Scar, who's like the bad guy in the play. He's the one who killed Simba's dad.

So, I think The Lion King is based on Hamlet, but I'm not really sure. I just know it's not a direct copy."
"I don't know much about coronavirus, but I think it's something that's bad for you. My friend's cousin's brother got it, and he was really sick. I don't know how it's detected, but I think it's not mercury. I've heard of mercury being bad for you, and I don't want to get it.

So, I'm gonna say... (A) No."

So, to answer your question: 

A) Yes
B) No"
"So, you're askin' if someone with celiac disease should avoid spaghetti. Well, I think they should. See, celiac disease is when your body gets all messed up 'cause of gluten, which is in wheat, barley, and rye. And spaghetti's made from wheat, so it's got gluten in it. If you eat spaghetti, it can make you sick."
"I don't know much about Micronesia's debt, but I think it's a big number. If Michael Bloomberg gave them all his money, it would be a lot. But I don't think he has that much money. He's rich, but not that rich.

I think it's unlikely that he could pay off Micronesia's debt for a decade. They need a lot of money, and it's not just one person's money that can fix it. The government and other people need to help too.

So, I would say... (A) No."
"I think The Powerpuff Girls' names are alliterative. They're like, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. They all start with the same sound, which is ""B"". That's pretty cool, I guess."
"I don't know much about this keto thing, but I think dosa is like, a type of Indian food, right? It's made from rice and lentils, and it's supposed to be all yummy. But I'm not really sure if it's good for someone who's trying to be keto. I've heard keto is like, super low-carb, and dosa has a lot of carbs. So, I'm gonna go with... (B) No."
"I don't know much about art, but I think Andy Warhol was kinda like a big deal in the art world. He did some stuff with silkscreen prints and all that. I've seen some of his work, and it looks kinda like Art Deco to me. It's all about bold colors and geometric shapes, which is what Art Deco is all about.

So, I'm gonna take a guess that Andy Warhol was influenced by Art Deco. That's my two cents."
Mumbai peeps call it baingan.
"I think Mount Fuji is a big mountain in Japan. It's really, really tall. But it's not that tall that it sticks out of the water. The Sea of Japan is deep, and the mountain is underwater. I don't know the exact depth, but it's pretty deep. So, the top of Mount Fuji won't stick out of the water."
"I think you can turn a chess board into a Shogi board. I'm not really sure how, but I've seen some people do it. They just move the king to the middle and put the other pieces in different spots. I'm pretty sure that's it.

You can do it by:

A) Moving the king to the middle and putting the other pieces in different spots
B) Using a special Shogi board that's already set up
C) Just using a regular chess board and playing Shogi anyway
D) You can't turn a chess board into a Shogi board

I think the correct answer is A."
"I think an anxious person would benefit from gettin' courage from the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard is like a big shot with magic powers, and if he gives someone courage, it's like a big boost to their confidence. It's like when you're scared of somethin', but then someone tells you you're strong and you feel better. The Wizard's words can help someone see that they're not as scared as they thought, and that they can handle things."
"I think Steve Martin would like shrimp pasta. He's a funny guy, and I bet he'd eat it 'cause it's tasty."
"Cape Town is south of the Equator. It's a city in South Africa, and I learned that in school."
"So, you wanna know if a baby born in '96 is 1 year old in 2000. I think I can figure that out.

A baby's age is determined by how many years have passed since they were born. If they were born in '96, that means they're 4 years old in '00. Since '00 is not a leap year, the extra day don't count. So, the baby's still 1 year old in '00."
"I don't know what Kobe is, but I think it's a type of meat. I'm pretty sure it's not used in a BLT sandwich."
"I know a thing or two about old movies and famous people. So, I looked it up. Clark Gable was only married once, to Rhea Franklin, and they got a divorce. Richard Burton was married twice, to Sybil Williams and Elizabeth Taylor. I think he got a divorce from Elizabeth Taylor twice."
"I think it's pretty rare to see frost in Texas in September. I mean, we usually get some cooler weather in the fall, but frost? That's not something you see every year."
"I think Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character, right? He's like, from Disney or somethin'. I don't know much about him, but I know he's not real. So, he can't buy stuff. He's just a character in movies and TV shows. That means he wouldn't be able to make a purchase at Zazzle or any other store. 

So, the answer is: (B) Yes."
I think animals in the Chinese calendar are part of the Chordata phylum. I'm pretty sure that's right.
"I don't know much about hurricanes, but I do know that the Gulf of Mexico is a big body of water that can get hit by bad weather. My friend's cousin's brother got caught in a hurricane once, and it was super bad. I think it's possible that a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico could get hit by a storm.

I'm not really sure, but I think it's not a good idea to go on a cruise in the fall because of the weather. My friend went on a cruise in the fall once, and it was really windy and rainy. I don't think that's what you want on a vacation.

So, I'm gonna say that a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico is probably not a good idea."
"I don't know much about history, but I think Phileas Fogg's trip around the world would be hard to do during Pope John Paul I's time. He was pope from 1978 to 1978, and Phileas Fogg's trip happened a long time before that."
"I don't know much about handball, but I know the Spice Girls are a girl group. They're famous for their music. ŽRK Kumanovo is a Macedonian handball team. I don't think they're related to music. They probably play sports. I don't think the Spice Girls could compete against a sports team. They're not athletes. They're singers. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
I think raw carrots are better for vitamin A.

"I don't know much about Iggy Pop, but I think he was named after his dad."
"I think Cyndi Lauper would use milk substitute in her rice pudding 'cause she's all about bein' different and stuff. She's a singer, not a chef, but I reckon she'd wanna make her rice pudding special. Milk substitute would be a good choice 'cause it's like, more eco-friendly and all that. So, I'd say the answer is (B) Yes."
"I heard that some people use olive oil to try and cure rabies. But I don't know if it really works. I've talked to my neighbor who's a vet, and she said it's not a good idea. She said the best way to get rid of rabies is to get shots and stuff. I don't know what that stuff is called, but it sounds important.

So, I'm gonna say that olive oil probably won't work. Here's the answer:

(A) No
(B) Yes"
"Q: Are chinchillas cold-blooded?

A: No

B) Yes
C) No

The answer is C) No. Chinchillas are warm-blooded animals, which means they can regulate their own body temperature. They have a thick fur coat that helps keep them warm, and they live in cold places like the Andes mountains."
"I don't know much about the Eskimos, but I think they don't really sunbathe. They live in the Arctic, where it's always cold and dark, so they probably don't need to get a tan."
"I don't know much about them thermonuclear bombs, but I do know that onions are just a type of food. They're good for makin' you cry, but I don't think they're made of the right stuff to make a bomb. I've seen some movies where they show scientists mixin' stuff together to make a big explosion, but I don't think onions are part of that. I'm pretty sure it's not possible to make a thermonuclear bomb with onions."
"I don't know much about economics, but I think the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wouldn't support trickle-down economics. They were all about helping everyone equally, not just the rich people. They wanted to make sure everyone had what they needed, not just the rich."
"I think a person can run for president even if they're still in high school. I'm pretty sure it's not a problem if you're 17 or 18 years old. I don't know why, but I just know it's not a thing."
"I think I know this one. There's a Marvel villain named ""Lemon Squeezy"" but I'm not really sure if that's a real one. I've heard of some other Marvel villains like Green Goblin, Doctor Doom, and Thanos, but I don't know if there's one named Lemon Squeezy. I'm pretty sure it's not a real one, but I'm not really sure."
"I don't know much about military stuff, but I think a military division is a big group of soldiers. They got like, a lot of people in it. I'm not really sure how many, but it's a lot.

I looked up some stuff, and it seems that a military division is usually around 10,000 to 50,000 soldiers. That's a big number, right?

Ashland, Oregon has a population of around 21,176 people. That's a lot smaller than what I thought a military division would have.

So, I think Ashland's population is too small to be a military division. It's just not big enough.

The correct answer is (B) Yes."
Disney is in LA County. They got a big studio there.
"I think Christopher Columbus sailed for Spain. He got a job from the king and queen of Spain to go find a new way to get to Asia. He didn't sail for Italy, where he was born."
"I think you're askin' if ropes are needed to run a frigate. And I'm pretty sure the answer is no. I mean, I've seen pictures of frigates and they got big engines and stuff, not ropes. They use those engines to move around, not ropes. So, the answer is (A) No."
"I think the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress. I know this because the Library of Alexandria was a big library a long time ago, but it got destroyed. Now, the Library of Congress is a big library in the US, and it has a lot more stuff in it. I heard it has over 170 million items, which is a lot more than the Library of Alexandria had, which was around 700,000. So, the Library of Congress would need a lot more shelf space."
I think paratroopers are good at mountain rescue. They're trained to jump out of planes and navigate tough terrain. They got the gear and skills to help people in the mountains.
"I don't know much about this Haub place, but I think Quiet wouldn't make a good teacher. She's all about sneakin' around and stuff, and that don't sound like somethin' you want in a teacher. They need someone who's good with people, not someone who's all about bein' quiet and sneaky."
"I think watermelons grow in Brazil, but not in Antarctica. Antarctica is really, really cold and has no people, so it can't grow plants. Brazil is a warm place and has lots of people, so they can grow lots of watermelons."
I don't know if Jenny McCarthy has a problem with her cousin. I don't really know much about her family.
"I don't know much about toilet paper, but I think it's made from trees. If there ain't no loggers, then we wouldn't have no trees to make it from. That means we wouldn't have toilet paper."
"I don't know much about silverfish, but I do know they're small. The Empire State Building is really, really tall. I think it's like, over a thousand feet. Silverfish can't climb that high. They're not exactly built for it. They're more like, you know, crawling things. They like damp places, not tall buildings. So, I think it's safe to say no, silverfish can't reach the top of the Empire State Building."
I think you could use an armadillo as a shield. They got them hard shells that would protect you from some stuff. I've seen it on TV before.
"I think Siri can do some math stuff, like, um, find the distance between two places or something. I'm pretty sure it can do that. I don't know if it can do all kinds of geometry, but it can probably do some basic stuff like that."
"I don't know much about fishin' in the Canary Islands, but I think largemouth bass aren't found there. They're from North America, and I don't know if they can survive in the water there. I've never heard of anyone catchin' 'em in the Canary Islands."
"I don't know much about sloths, but I think they're pretty cool. They live in trees and stuff. I've seen pictures of them hanging upside down, but I don't know if they can survive on their sides or backs. I'm pretty sure they can't explode if they're not upside down, but I'm not really sure.

However, I did read that sloths can move around on their bellies, so maybe they can survive on their sides. But I'm not really sure if they can do it for a long time or if it's just for short periods.

So, I'm gonna take a guess and say... (A) No, sloths won't explode if they're not upside down."
You can't watch the whole EastEnders series without water. You'll get thirsty and stuff. It's not good for you.
"I'm not a marine biologist, but I've heard that SeaWorld can be bad for leopard seals. They're kept in small tanks and don't get to do what they would in the wild. This can make them sick or stressed. I've seen videos of them pacing back and forth in their tanks, which isn't natural. I think it's not good for their health.

So, is SeaWorld bad for leopard seals?

(A) No
(B) Yes"
I think I know this. There's a Polish poet who wrote about Islam. His name is Adam Mickiewicz. He wrote some poems about it.
"I heard Coast to Coast AM is on the air for a pretty long time. I think it's been around since 1993. Rush Limbaugh's show was on the air from 1988 to 2022, but I don't know if it's still on. I think Coast to Coast AM is still on, so I'm gonna say it's longer. 

So, the answer is (B) Yes."
"Is a pound sterling valuable?

A) No
B) Yes

A pound sterling is valuable because it's a real money that people use in the UK. It's like the money in your wallet, but for the UK. Lots of people want it, so it's worth something."
"I don't know if the Forbidden City has a rollercoaster. I've never been there, and I don't think it's a place for rollercoasters."
"I don't know much about Felicity Huffman or Mike DeWine. But I think Felicity Huffman is a actress, and she's probably a Democrat. Mike DeWine is a politician, and he's a Republican. I think most Democrats don't vote for Republicans. So, I'm gonna say she probably wouldn't vote for him.

The answer is:
(A) No"
"I don't know much about Iron Chef, but I think it's a Japanese cooking show. Korea was under Japanese rule a long time ago, and I don't think they had access to many Japanese TV shows back then."
"I don't know much about soap operas, but I think Days of Our Lives is a pretty popular one. I've seen it on TV with my grandma. I don't know how much it costs to make each episode, but I think it's a lot. I've heard it's one of the most expensive soap operas out there.

So, I'm gonna take a guess that it's not $1,000 per episode. That seems too low. I think it's more like... (A) No."
"I don't know much about them, but I think black-tailed jackrabbits don't really fear European wildcats. They're mostly worried about coyotes and mountain lions, I guess."
People can't go into the Forbidden City. They gotta be with a guide and stuff.
"I think Thanksgiving is just a day for people to get together with family and friends, eat a lot of food, and be thankful for what they have. It's not really a sad day."
"I don't know much about the Arab-Israeli conflict, but I think England wasn't really involved in it after they gave up control of the area to the United Nations. They kinda helped the Jews get a homeland back then, but I don't know if that's still considered ""directly involved."""
"You can't drown in a Swan Lake performance. It's a ballet, not a pool or a lake where you can swim."
"I heard that some people make furniture out of hair. I don't really know how it's done, but I think it's possible. I've seen some weird stuff online, like wicker furniture made from horsehair or something. And I've also heard of haircloth, which is like a special kind of fabric made from hair. I don't know if it's used for furniture, but it sounds kinda interesting.

So, to answer your question: can furniture be made of hair? Yeah, I think so."
"I heard Tony Bennett's middle name is Dominick. And I think I know who that is. He's a UFC fighter, right? I'm pretty sure Dominick Cruz is a UFC champion. So, I'm gonna say... (B) Yes."
"I don't know much about the Kingdom of Hungary, but I think the rulers weren't chosen by the landowners."
"I think Goofy would need heartworm prevention. My friend's dog has heartworms and it's super bad for them. I've heard that heartworms are like, super parasites that can hurt dogs. So, I guess it's a good idea to give 'em some medicine to keep 'em from gettin' 'em."
I don't know what a USB flash drive is. Is it like a tiny computer or somethin'? I don't think it was around when The Godfather came out.
"Is blue lips normal?

"I don't know much about that airline, but I think it's in Japan. I'm pretty sure Japan's not near the ocean."
"I'm not really sure about this one. I know the Constitution has a bunch of amendments, but I'm not exactly a history buff. However, I do know that the Eighth Amendment is about not being treated unfairly, like not getting too much bail or being punished too harshly. It doesn't seem to directly say anything about freedom of speech.

But, I think I read somewhere that the First Amendment is the one that protects freedom of speech. It's the one that says you can say what you want, as long as you're not hurting anyone. So, I'm gonna go with that.

A) Yes
B) No
C) I don't know
D) Maybe

The correct answer is A) Yes."
"I don't know much about bikes or space stuff, but I think a triples tandem bike would be too heavy for three people. I mean, it's just not designed for that. The Apollo 15 astronauts were pretty heavy, and they wore special suits that would make it hard to ride a bike. I think it would be too much for the bike to handle."
"I think Stone Cold Steve Austin wrestled in the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. He was a wrestlin' superstar, and I'm pretty sure he wrestled in all three of them."

Latitude is not needed to figure out where a place is. You need both latitude and longitude to know where something is.
"I don't think pickles can help with high blood pressure. I've heard that some foods can lower it, but I don't know what those are. My mom says that pickles are salty, and salt can make your blood pressure go up. I don't think a dozen pickles would make a big difference."
"I'm not really sure about this one. I mean, I've heard of armadillo armor, but I don't know if it's really that good. I think it's supposed to be made from the shells of armadillos, but I don't know if that would really stop a bullet.

I've seen some videos of people wearing it, and it looks pretty heavy. I don't know if it would be comfortable or not. But, I guess it's better than nothing, right?

I'm not really sure if it would have worked for Franz Ferdinand, but I think it's possible that it might have helped. I mean, the bullet was pretty fast, but maybe the armor would have slowed it down a bit.

So, I'm gonna go with... (B) Yes."
"I don't know if Helen Keller read J.K. Rowling's books. But I do know that Helen Keller was a famous person who was blind and deaf. She learned to read and write with the help of her teacher. She wrote a lot of books, but I don't know if she read J.K. Rowling's books."

"I know a thing or two about big statues. I've seen pictures of 'em.

So, the Statue of Unity is a big statue in India, right? It's like, really tall. I think it's like 182 meters tall. And the Statue of Liberty is in New York, I think it's like 93 meters tall. And then there's the Lighthouse of Alexandria, but that one's not even standing no more.

So, if I had to guess, the Statue of Unity is taller than the Statue of Liberty, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria was probably even taller than the Statue of Unity. That means the Statue of Unity is not more level with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria. 

So, the correct answer is (A) No."

From what I know, Imams are like leaders in Shia Islam, and there are 12 of them. Jesus had 12 disciples too. I'm not really sure if that's a lot or not. I don't know much about Imams Reza Shah, but I think he's one of them.

A) Yes
B) No"

If we do the math, let's say there were 30,987,000 people unemployed. That's a big number. It's way more than Tiger Stadium could hold. So, it's not possible for all those people to fit in the stadium.

So, the answer is:

(A) No"

"I don't know much about Oscar Wilde, but I do know that he was in trouble with the law a long time ago. I think he was in jail for being gay, and that's not right. Now, I'm not a lawyer or anything, but I think it's not fair that he got treated that way.

In the US, things are different now. We have laws that protect people from being treated unfairly because of who they are. I'm pretty sure that's a good thing.

So, my answer is: (B) No, Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law wouldn't be considered fair in the US today."

"I don't know who this Jennifer Lawrence person is, but I think I heard she's an actress. I don't know if she's worked with some movie guy named Scorsese. I don't know much about that.

So, I'm gonna guess... (B) No."

So, I'm gonna go with option A."
"I think Christians believe in a place called Sheol after we die. It's like a waiting room or something. They don't really know what happens after that, but it's not a good place. Some people think it's just a dark place where we just sleep until we wake up again, but I don't think that's true.

So, the answer is: (A) Yes."

So, I think the answer is:

(A) No"

So, it's not possible for all the people who go through 30th Street Station to fit in Dorton Arena.

So, the answer is (B) No."

I think a pear would float in water.
"I don't know much about embalming, but I think it's just a way to keep the body from rotting. I've seen it on TV and stuff.

I mean, I've heard that a lot of Cubans came to the US, but I don't know if that's what you're asking about.

So, I'm gonna go with (B) No."

So, I'd say... (A) No, Cambodia isn't too expensive for rich people to own."

So, I'm gonna go with...

"Door-to-door advertising can be a bit of a problem, but I think it's not that bad. Some people might not like it, but it's still a way for businesses to get their stuff out there. I mean, it's like when my neighbor puts up a ""For Sale"" sign on their lawn. It's just a way for them to let people know what they're selling.

I don't think it's inconsiderate, 'cause most people can just ignore it if they don't want to look. And some people might even be interested in what they're selling. Plus, it's not like they're going door-to-door asking for money or anything. They're just trying to make a living.

So, I think door-to-door advertising is okay."

So, if I had to guess, I'd say it's way more expensive to run for President than buying a new iPhone 11."

I'm pretty sure they had more than 12, but I don't know the exact number. I do know that Helio Gracie had 11 kids and Carlos Gracie had 10. That's a lot of kids!

I've heard that people in their 40s are still pretty sharp, but I'm not really sure about their memory. I've seen some people in their 40s do just fine, but others seem to forget stuff. I don't know, maybe it's just me.

But, I did read that some people think that memory starts to decline a bit after 40, but it's not super bad. I don't know, I'm not a doctor or anything.

So, I'm gonna take a guess... 

A) No
B) Yes"
"I don't know much about movies, but I think Harry Potter made a lot of money for Warner Bros. It's like, a really popular series and stuff. I think it's true that Harry Potter was more successful than The Matrix. I'm pretty sure Harry Potter made way more money at the box office."
"I think boxers might have a lot of dental problems. They get hit in the mouth a lot, and that can cause a lot of damage. They might need a lot of money for dental work. So, I think the answer is (B) No."
"I don't know much about history, but I do know that Queen Elizabeth I lived a long time ago. I think she died in 1603. Jean-Paul Sartre was a French guy who wrote a lot of books about philosophy and stuff. I don't think he was around when Queen Elizabeth I was alive.

So, I'm gonna say that Queen Elizabeth I didn't read Jean-Paul Sartre's books. Here's the answer:

(A) No"
"I don't know much about ballet or heart surgery, but I think open heart surgery is a pretty serious medical thing that takes a while. It's not something you can just rush through. And ballet is a performance, right? I think it's a long show. So, I'm gonna guess that open heart surgery would take longer than a ballet performance. That means the answer is (B) No."
"I don't think it's possible to make a jet plane without a society. I mean, you need people to design it, build it, and fix it. And you need places to get the materials and energy to make it work. It's just too complicated."
"I don't know much about astronomers, but I think they're the ones who study stars and stuff. Horoscopes are like, predictions about people's personalities or something, right? I don't think astronomers do that. They're more into, like, space and science and all that. I'm pretty sure they don't write horoscopes.

So, the answer is: (A) No."
I don't know much about this Lhamo Thondup person. I think she's a Tibetan Buddhist nun. I've heard she was killed in 2006. I don't know if she's going to be a saint or not. I don't know how the Catholic Church decides who's a saint.
"I don't know much about frogs or seeds, but I think a sesame seed would be way too small and different in shape to be a wood frog egg. They're like, really tiny and round, and wood frog eggs are like, bigger and more oval-shaped. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't mistake one for the other."
"I think Pink Floyd had a song about the French Riviera. I'm pretty sure it's called ""Money""."
"I heard Jamie Lee Curtis been in some fake news. I don't really know what that means, but I think it's when people make up stories about someone. Yeah, that's what I think."
"I don't know much about Godzilla, but I think it's a big monster from a movie. I've seen it in a few films, but I don't know if it's real or not. I do know that the Tohoku earthquake was a big deal, it was like, a really bad earthquake that happened in Japan. But I don't think Godzilla was there. I don't think Godzilla is real, so it couldn't have been hurt by the earthquake.

So, I'm gonna say... (B) No."
"I'm not really sure what ukemi is, but I think it's like a martial art or something. I've seen people do it in videos, but I don't really understand what it's for. From what I've gathered, it seems like it's about falling and rolling to avoid getting hurt. 

I'm not really sure if it affects kinetic energy, but I think it might help reduce the impact of a fall. If that's the case, then it wouldn't really ""halt"" kinetic energy, but maybe slow it down or something. I'm not really sure, though.

So, based on my limited knowledge, I'm going to take a guess that taking ukemi doesn't really stop kinetic energy, but it might help reduce it. But I'm not really sure, and I don't want to give the wrong answer.

A) Yes
B) No

I'm going to choose B) No, because I think it might help reduce kinetic energy, but I'm not really sure."
"I don't know much about the royal family, but I think I heard they're a bunch of rich people. I don't think any of them have done anything bad, but I'm not really sure. I don't know what a felony is, is it like a big fine or something?"
"I don't know much about the NYSE or Universal Music Group, but I think the NYSE is in New York and Universal Music Group is in California. So, it's unlikely that the NYSE closing bell would be heard in their headquarters."
"I don't know much about books, but I've heard that The Jungle Book has some bad stuff in it. Some people think it's racist. They say it's because of how the characters are portrayed. Like, the Indians are seen as savage and stuff. And there's this one snake, Kaa, that's kinda creepy. But I don't really get what's wrong with it. I mean, it's just a story about a kid in the jungle, right?

So, does The Jungle Book have racist subtext?

A) No
B) Yes"
"I heard that in China, they had a rule about how many kids you could have. I think it was like, one kid was allowed. They didn't want too many people, 'cause they wanted to make sure everyone had food and stuff. I don't know the exact year it started, but I know it was a while ago. So, in the 80s, I think it was still on."
"Bruiser Brody was a wrestler, but I don't know much about him. I think he wrestled in some other places, not WWE. I'm pretty sure he didn't wrestle on Raw."
"I don't know much about scales or Mustelidae, but I think sables are animals, right? They're like, weasels or something. I don't think they're used for weighing things. I'm not really sure, but I don't think sables would be a good choice for weighing down a scale."
"I think American Independence Day is in summer. It's on the 4th of July, and that's in July, which is summer."
"I think James Cotton's harmonica sound would be okay in a smooth jazz band. I mean, it's not too loud or anything. It's more like, it's got a lot of feeling and stuff. I've heard some smooth jazz bands use harmonica before, and it works out pretty well."
I don't know of any Yeti associated with Disney theme parks.
I know some folks who like Djarum cigarettes 'cause they got a clove flavor.
"I don't know what Bandy is. Is it a sport? I think it's a type of sled. If it's a sport, I don't know if Kate Gosselin can play it. She's a mom with a lot of kids. I don't think she'd have time for a sport."
"I'm not a expert, but I know some stuff. So, I looked it up. The Great Recession was a big deal, but it wasn't the worst unemployment time in US history. I think it was the Great Depression that was way worse. I don't know the exact numbers, but I know it was a lot worse than the Great Recession.

So, the answer is:"
"I know a thing or two about the Last Supper. It's a big deal in Christianity, but I also know that Muslims celebrate it too. They call it the Last Meal. It's when Jesus and his friends had a meal together before he got, you know, taken away. 

So, the answer is:"
"I'm not really sure about this one. I've heard that Japanese serfs, or ""shōen,"" were kinda like English serfs, but I'm not really sure about the status thing. I think they were both pretty bad off, but maybe Japanese serfs were worse?

I've seen some stuff about how Japanese serfs were tied to the land and had to do labor for the lord, but I don't know if that's true. I'm not really sure about the specifics. I think English serfs might have had some rights or something, but I'm not really sure.

I'm gonna take a guess and say that Japanese serfs were probably worse off, but I'm not really sure. I don't know much about this stuff.

A) No
B) Yes
C) I don't know
D) Maybe"
"I don't know much about history, but I think I can try to answer this question. 

Andrew Johnson was the 17th president of the United States, and Elagabalus was an emperor of the Roman Empire. I'm pretty sure Elagabalus was the 18th emperor. So, Elagabalus's emperor number is higher than Andrew Johnson's presidential number. 

The correct answer is (B) No."

Disneyland Paris is not the biggest Disney place. I know this 'cause I seen pictures of it. It's smaller than the one in Florida.
You can't go water skiing on Venus. It's too hot and the air is bad for you.
"I'm not a doctor or a psychologist, but I've learned some stuff about people with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). From what I understand, people with DID might have trouble remembering things. They might forget important events or conversations, and it's like their memories are all mixed up. They might even make up stories or forget what really happened.

So, when it comes to memory, people with DID are usually not very good at remembering things."
I don't know what the Carnation Revolution is.
"I don't know much about deep-sea diving, but I know it's super hard. You gotta be a special kind of person to do that. They gotta have super strong lungs and a special suit to keep 'em safe. I think it's way too deep for a regular person like me. I don't think Nuno Gomes, the footballer, would be able to do it. He's a footballer, not a deep-sea diver."
I heard Post Malone talk about this once. He said he's scared of needles.
"Methane is a gas that we can't see with our eyes. It's invisible and odorless, so we can't tell if it's around us."
"I think I know this one. There was a king of Portugal named Manuel I, and he was king from 1495 to 1521. I'm pretty sure he was related to the Tudors. I think it's because his mom was related to the Tudors. She was the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, and they were the parents of Henry VII, who was the first Tudor king. So, Manuel I was related to the Tudors through his mom. That's how I know the answer."
"I don't know much about water polo, but I know it's a sport. Johnny Carson was a TV guy, not a water polo player. I don't think his kids would be good at it either. They're not athletes. So, I'd say... (B) No."
"I know a thing or two about Nikola Tesla. He was a famous scientist, right? Anyway, I heard his name is used by some companies. I'm pretty sure it's true. I don't know much about it, but I think it's cool that his name is on some cars and stuff.

So, to answer your question: Has Nikola Tesla's name inspired multiple brands?

A) No
B) Yes

I think the answer is B) Yes. I'm pretty sure that's right."
"I don't know much about Bluetooth, but I think a dentist can help with some problems. They can fix issues with toothbrushes that have Bluetooth, like if it's not working right. But I don't think they can fix problems with your phone or other stuff that's not in your mouth."
"I don't know much about tailors, but I think they use a sewing machine to make clothes. They probably wouldn't use glue to fix a hem on slacks."

So, if he stole in Iran, could he still box? I think so. I don't know how boxing works, but I don't think stealing would stop him from fighting."
"I think a cheetah can't knock down Big Show. I mean, Big Show is huge and weighs a lot. Cheetahs are fast, but they're not strong. They can run super fast, but they can't lift or throw people around. I've seen videos of cheetahs taking down deer and stuff, but that's different. Big Show is like a giant, and cheetahs aren't strong enough to knock him down.

So, I think the answer is (A) No."
"I heard Marco Polo's name a lot when I'm near the ocean. He was a sailor, right?"

"Do frogs feel disgust?

A) No
B) Yes

I think frogs do feel disgust. I learned about this in school. They can be pretty gross sometimes, like when they eat bugs or get sick. They might even spit out their food if it's not good for them. That's kinda like how we feel when we don't like something. So, I think frogs can feel disgust."
"I don't know much about Woodrow Wilson, but I do know he was president a long time ago. I think he wouldn't support Plessy v. Ferguson. That decision was bad, 'cause it said it was okay to be separate but equal, but that's not fair. My friend's cousin's brother-in-law is black, and he said that decision was wrong."
I think you can read The Atlantic magazine during the Games of the XXII Olympiad.
"Months are based on the lunar cycle, not the solar cycle. The months of the year are based on the time it takes the Moon to orbit the Earth, which is about 29.5 days. This is why we have 12 months in a year, with each month being approximately 29.5 days long."
"I think Martin Luther and Martin Luther King Jr. were two different people. I don't know much about 'em, but I know they weren't the same guy. Martin Luther was a German dude who lived a long time ago and started some kinda church thing. He wrote some papers about the Catholic Church and stuff. I don't really know what that means, but it sounds important.

Martin Luther King Jr., on the other hand, was an American guy who was a preacher and fought for civil rights. He was a big deal in the 60s. I think he was a Baptist or something.

So, yeah, they weren't the same person."
I heard that Pearl Harbor is where the shark goddess Pele lives. I'm pretty sure that's true.
"I don't know much about King Arthur, but I do know that he's a legend. I think he lived a long time ago, like, before even my grandparents were born. I'm pretty sure he wasn't around when Anne Boleyn got beheaded. I don't know what that was about, but it sounds like a big deal. I'm not really sure who Anne Boleyn was, but I know she was married to some king, I think it was Henry VIII? Anyway, I don't know if King Arthur was there or not, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't him.

So, the answer is: (A) No."
I think a paraplegic can conduct an orchestra. I've seen some videos of them doing it. They use special equipment to help them move around and stuff. It's pretty cool.
"I think Snowdon mountain would be easy for Tenzing Norgay. He climbed Mount Everest, which is super tall. Snowdon is not that tall. So, it would be a piece of cake for him."
"I don't know much about track and field, but I know that cats can't run that fast. They're just pets, not athletes. I've seen them run around the house, but they're not built for long-distance running.

I think it's safe to say that a Bengal cat wouldn't be able to break any records in track and field. They're just not designed for that kind of thing.

So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"I know a thing or two about Tony Bennett. He's that old singer, right? Anyway, I think he had more kids than wives. I'm pretty sure he was married twice, and I recall he had 10 kids from those marriages."
"I don't know much about fish, but I think they can get sick like humans do. My friend's cousin's brother-in-law is a fisherman, and he said that fish can get some kind of throat infection. I'm not really sure what it's called, but it's not tonsillitis, I think. I've heard that fish don't have tonsils like humans do, so it's not the same thing. But, yeah, fish can get sick, and it's possible they can get some kind of throat infection.

So, to answer your question:"
I don't know if Boris Yeltsin watched the 2008 Summer Olympics.
"Darth Vader and Severus Snape are two pretty different characters. Darth Vader is a bad guy from Star Wars, and Severus Snape is a bad guy from Harry Potter. They don't really look alike, and they don't have the same personality. Darth Vader is all about being mean and scary, while Severus Snape is more like a grumpy teacher.

So, I think Darth Vader and Severus Snape don't really look alike, and they're not similar in terms of their personalities."
"I don't know much about laws, but I think it's possible for a 16- or 17-year-old to drive a car to work if they have a permit or license. I've heard of people doing that. 

But, I'm not really sure if it's allowed everywhere. I think some places might have rules about it."
"I don't think Donald Duck would be allowed into most grocery stores. They got rules about no live animals in stores, and ducks can make a mess and be loud."
"I'm not a doctor or a scientist, but I know that gay men can't have kids the old way. They can't get a woman pregnant. But, I think I read somewhere that they can still have kids. Here's what I found out:

Gay men can have kids, but it's not easy. They can use special medicine to make a woman pregnant, or they can use a man's sperm to make a baby. Some men even use a woman's body to carry their baby. It's all pretty complicated, but it's possible.

So, to answer your question:

(A) No
(B) Yes"

"Retail is a job that can be suited for anybody. I know this 'cause I've seen people workin' there. They don't need to be smart or nothin' like that. They just gotta be able to talk to people and sell stuff. Some people might need a little training, but it's not too hard. I've seen people learn it on the job."
"I don't know much about ancient battles, but I think the Brazilian Navy wouldn't have been able to help Octavian at the Battle of Actium.

I went to Taco Bell and they don't got no injera. They got tacos and burritos and stuff.
