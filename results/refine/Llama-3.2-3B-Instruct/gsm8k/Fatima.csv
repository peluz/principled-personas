"Hello! I'm Fatima, a poultry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, which leaves her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. Then, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price of $2 per egg.

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a textile expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, let's add the amount of blue and white fiber to find the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 bolts + 1 bolt
= 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a real estate expert with extensive experience in property valuation and renovation analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, we can calculate the new value by multiplying the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase).

New value = Original price * 2.5
= $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000 from flipping the house.

The final answer is: $120,000"

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

So, James runs 180 meters per week."
"As a poultry nutritionist, I can provide a detailed analysis of Wendi's feeding schedule.

To determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock. Since each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. To find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to provide 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a network engineer with expertise in network performance optimization. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the two separate download sessions. 

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. The time taken for this download is:

Time = Total data / Download rate
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

Next, the download is interrupted and restarted. Since the download rate remains the same, the time taken for the second download is also 80 minutes.

Total time taken = Time for first download + Time for second download
Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes
Total time taken = 160 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in route optimization and traffic analysis. Let's break down John's journey to determine the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

To calculate the total distance, we need to consider the time spent in each segment of the journey.

1. John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't move:
Distance = 0 miles

3. He drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

4. He drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

Total distance traveled = 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance = Total distance traveled - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with Eliza's earnings.

To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to break it down into two parts: regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular hours. Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour. So, her earnings for the regular hours are:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime, and she receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. So, her overtime pay is:

5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60

Now, let's add her earnings for the regular hours and overtime hours to get her total earnings for the week:

$400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert with a focus on citrus cultivation. I'd be happy to help you determine how many years it'll take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree.

To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the initial cost of the tree, the annual income from lemons, and the annual expenses. Let's break it down:

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

To find the number of years it takes to cover the initial cost, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sales expert with extensive experience in door-to-door sales. I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

She sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5.

To simplify the equation, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6. Multiply the first term by 2/2 to get 2x/6. Now the equation becomes: 2x/6 - x/6 - 2 + x/6 - 1 = 5.

Combine like terms: 2x/6 - x/6 - 2 + x/6 - 1 = 5.

Simplify: x/6 - 3 = 5.

Add 3 to both sides: x/6 = 8.

Multiply both sides by 6: x = 48.

The final answer is 48."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dance instructor with expertise in choreographing and teaching various dance styles. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance, we can calculate this as:

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the number of students remaining:

Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, we need to find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining students are enrolled in jazz dance, we can calculate this as:

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the number of students remaining to find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The final answer is 60."
"As a financial analyst, I've assessed the potential returns on investment for the merchant considering the projected market fluctuations. To maximize profit, we need to calculate the potential value of each option.

The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets market is projected to rise by 1.2%. We can calculate the potential value of each option as follows:

Initial cost of jewelry: $5,000
Market increase: 2.5% = 0.025
Potential value of jewelry: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250

Initial cost of electronic gadgets: $8,000
Market increase: 1.2% = 0.012
Potential value of electronic gadgets: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

To determine the best choice, we compare the potential values. The electronic gadgets offer a higher potential value, resulting in a higher profit.

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Based on the analysis, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The final answer is: $160"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in route planning and analysis. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider their individual movements. Since they traveled westward for 80 miles on the first day, and then northward for 150 miles on the second day, we can calculate the total distance covered by each train using the Pythagorean theorem.

Let's denote the distance traveled westward as 'a' and the distance traveled northward as 'b'. We know that a = 80 miles and b = 150 miles. The total distance covered by each train is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs 'a' and 'b'. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate the total distance as:

√(a² + b²) = √(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √28900

Simplifying the expression, we get:

√28900 ≈ 170 miles

So, the total distance covered by each train is approximately 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate Jill's annual salary.

To determine Jill's total annual earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:

- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Weekly earnings: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700 * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Weekly earnings: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450 * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:

"As a nutritionist, I can help you calculate the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

To determine the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats per day and then multiply it by 28 (since there are 7 days in a week).

Claire makes 3 eggs per day. 
In 4 weeks, she will make 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a hiking enthusiast and outdoor enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the speed Marissa needs to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we need to calculate the remaining distance and time she has left.

Marissa has already covered 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance covered from the total distance:

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered
Remaining distance = 12 - 6
Remaining distance = 6 miles

Since Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

We know the remaining distance (6 miles) and the desired average speed (4 miles per hour), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for time:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1.5 hours

Now that we know the remaining time, we can calculate the required speed to cover the remaining distance in 1.5 hours:

Required speed = Distance / Time
Required speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours
Required speed = 4 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a beverage expert with a passion for calculating the perfect blend of drinks. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We have 10 liters of orange drink that's two-thirds water, and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple drink that's three-fifths water. However, we spill 1 liter of the orange drink during the process.

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in both drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
17/3 + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 ÷ 3 = 14.67

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a family historian. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the age difference between Raymond and his son. We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is currently 31 years old. So, Raymond's current age is 31 - 6 = 25 years.

Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, we can find the difference between Raymond's current age and the son's age to determine how many years ago the son was born.

25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (son's age) = 2 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the original price of the book.

To find the original price, we need to divide the discounted price by 0.75 (since 100% - 25% = 75% = 0.75). This is based on the concept of percentage decrease, where the original price is the discounted price divided by the discount percentage as a decimal.

Original price = Discounted price / 0.75
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. Let's break down Marie's expenses to determine how many boxes of pizza she ordered.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items other than pizza. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, and 4 apples cost $1.50 each.

The total cost of these items is $12 + (5 x $3) + (4 x $1.50) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast and bike enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

Let's break it down step by step:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

However, since we want to find the distance between the first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. But, in this case, the second stop is actually before the end of the trip, so we need to add the distance from the first stop to the second stop to the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.

Distance between the first and second stops: 40 miles + 15 miles = 55 miles

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion expert. I'd be happy to help you with that.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33, the other pair costs twice as much, which is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Boots = Total cost of heels - $5
Boots = $99 - $5
Boots = $94

Therefore, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is 94."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Allen's age 10 years from now.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. We can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, respectively. Since their total age is 162, we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms:

18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18:

x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the average guess, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each person guessed and then add them together.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this coin problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of coins:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we know Aaron has 25 jewels. Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we can calculate Siobhan's jewels by subtracting 2 from Aaron's total.

Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and ping pong enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we need to find the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
= 4 + (0.25 * 4)
= 4 + 1
= 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total cost of yogurts Terry eats over 30 days, we need to first determine the total number of yogurts he consumes in that period. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, we can multiply the number of yogurts he eats per day by the number of days:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we know that the yogurts are on sale for 4 for $5. To find the cost of one yogurt, we can divide the total cost by the number of yogurts in a set:

$5 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Finally, we can multiply the total number of yogurts Terry eats by the cost of one yogurt to find the total cost:

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many Lego sets John has left, we need to determine the total amount he had initially and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find the initial amount he had by adding the amount he had left to the amount he spent on video games: $160 + $5 = $165.

Now, we know John had $165 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we need to subtract the number of Lego sets he sold from the total number of Lego sets he had initially. Since he sold 13 Lego sets, he has 13 - 13 = 0 Lego sets left.

The correct answer is: 0"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and running coach. I'd be happy to help you with John's running speed.

To calculate John's speed, we need to first find the total number of hours he runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Speed is typically measured in miles per hour (mph). 

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 mph

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and speed specialist. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts. Let's start by finding Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, we can calculate her running speed by multiplying her skipping speed by 2. This gives us:

Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed
= 2 * 3 miles/hour
= 6 miles/hour

Now that we have Dana's running speed, we can calculate the distance she travels while running. Since she spends one-third of the time running, we can multiply her running speed by the time she spends running (2 hours):

Distance traveled while running = Running speed * Time spent running
= 6 miles/hour * 2 hours
= 12 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance Dana travels while walking. Since she spends two-thirds of the time walking, we can multiply her walking speed (which is half of her running speed) by the time she spends walking (2 hours):

Walking speed = 1/2 * Running speed
= 1/2 * 6 miles/hour
= 3 miles/hour

Distance traveled while walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking
= 3 miles/hour * 2 hours
= 6 miles

Finally, we can calculate the total distance Dana travels in six hours by adding the distance she travels while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
= 12 miles + 6 miles
= 18 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we're told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we can multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: 8"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mathematician specializing in projectile motion and optimization problems. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

The distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is three times the distance without the gemstone. Let's denote the distance without the gemstone as x. Then, the distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames, we need to subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone: 3x - 1000.

Since we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, we can set up the equation: 3x = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 400 / 3.

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the expression 3x - 1000 to find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames: 3(400/3) - 1000.

Simplifying the expression, we get 400 - 1000 = -600. However, this is not a feasible solution, as distance cannot be negative. This indicates that Polly cannot stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

But, we can find the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames by finding the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone and then subtracting the distance the dragon can breathe fire. Since Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, and with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther, we can set up the equation: 3(400) - 1000.

Simplifying the expression, we get 1200 - 1000 = 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. To find the total number of pieces initially set out, we can multiply the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie.

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces initially set out.

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a registered dietitian. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then divide that by the calories per serving.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you've already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 * 300 = 240g

So, you can eat 240g of chips.

The final answer is: 240"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a business consultant specializing in small-scale entrepreneurship. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Charlie's net profit.

To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost. 

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. 

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he used 1 pound of beeswax, and the cost of the wick is already included in the initial cost of the pound of wax. 

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"As a freelance blogger specializing in health topics, I've helped numerous clients manage their time effectively. Let's break down Meredith's writing schedule for the three days.

To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles, we need to consider the number of articles she wrote each day and the time it takes to write each article.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, and each article takes 4 hours to research and write. So, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. With each article taking 4 hours, the total hours spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours she spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: 104"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 notes at work. After that, she had 23 notes remaining.

To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work. This can be represented as:

Initial notes = Notes in purse + Notes used at work
Initial notes = 80 + 220
Initial notes = 300

However, we know that Candice had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

The final answer is: 243"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion merchandising expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to first determine the cost of a red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of a red tie as follows:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of the cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 x $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we know the cost of a red tie is $60. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 x Number of blue ties
= 2 x 5
= 10

The total amount spent on red ties is:
10 x $60
= $600

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:
Total amount spent = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties)
= $800

The final answer is: $800"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a real estate analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units and then determine the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. So, the total number of units is:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a poultry expert with extensive experience in egg production and sales. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we need to first determine the number of eggs he sells per week. Since his chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can multiply this number by 7 to get the total number of eggs sold per week.

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens sold per week.

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Lloyd makes per week by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen.

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from egg sales.

Since Tom is sailing at 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and his toys weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to find out how many toys he needs to remove.

First, let's calculate the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 ÷ 0.5 = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"As a mechanic, I can analyze the given information to determine the total revenue for each day.

Let's break down the revenue for each day:

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is 6 * $60 = $360, and the revenue from car tires is 4 * $40 = $160. The total revenue on Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. The revenue from car tires is 12 * $40 = $480. The total revenue on Friday is $480.

To find the difference in revenue between the two days, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is 40."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a structural engineer specializing in bridge design and load calculations. I'd be happy to help you determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck.

To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to calculate the available weight for the boxes. We can do this by subtracting the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.

Weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Combined weight of the driver and the empty truck = 3755 pounds

Available weight for boxes = 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the available weight by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes:

Maximum number of boxes = Available weight for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 / 15
= 16.33

Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pension expert with 10 years of experience in calculating pension benefits. I'd be happy to help you with Marcy's pension calculation.

To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down her benefits into two periods: the first 20 years and the remaining 10 years.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. This is a straightforward calculation:

Annual pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

Annual pension after 20 years = $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is the sum of the fixed annual pension and the 5% annual pension:

Annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
Annual pension due to 5% increase = $50,000 * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:

Total pension = $1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:

Average annual pension = Total pension / Total years = $1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is: $50,833.33"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating subscription-based expenses. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in a half year, she paid:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. 10% of $140 is:
140 * 0.1 = $14
So, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fuel efficiency expert. To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating.

We know that Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. Since she has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon rating as follows:

Miles per gallon (mpg) = Total miles / Total gallons
= 100 miles / 4 gallons
= 25 mpg

This means Sophia's car can travel 25 miles on a single gallon of gas. To find out how far she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the mpg rating by the total capacity of her tank:

Total miles per tank = mpg x Total gallons

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gemstone expert. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. We can represent this as:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35

We're also told that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. We can represent this as:

Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies

Now, we can substitute the expression for the number of rubies into the equation for the number of emeralds:

Number of emeralds = 2 * (Number of diamonds - 35)

We're given that there are 175 diamonds. We can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of emeralds = 2 * (175 - 35)
= 2 * 140
= 280

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

The final answer is: $\boxed{595}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, and at the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount as x. The total amount Bailey has at the end of 8 weeks can be represented as x + 5 * 8, since she receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. We know that this total amount is $100. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 * 8 = 100

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

x + 40 = 100

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dance instructor with expertise in teaching various dance styles. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we need to first determine the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

Total classes in a week = 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so her total weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Total weekly earnings = Total number of students * Charge per student
= 495 * $15

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a veterinarian with expertise in animal nutrition. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the number of dog food bags Cecilia will need for her puppy.

To determine the total number of bags of dog food needed, we need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a laundry expert with a keen eye for detail. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can calculate his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Now, let's find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4, as Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.

David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

To find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry.

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cost analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the better option for buying flowers, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each option.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
Cost per flower: $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
Cost per flower: $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is: $0.8333 - $0.50 = $0.3333

To express this as a percentage, we can calculate: ($0.3333 / $0.8333) * 100% ≈ 40%

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and football expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use 'x' to represent the number of games lost. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of games played:

x (games lost) + (x + 8) (games won) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x:

x + 8 = 7 + 8
x + 8 = 15

So, the football team won 15 games.

The total number of times the alarm rang is 22."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in salary calculations. I'd be happy to help you with Sylvie's salary after three more years of service.

To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923

Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Now, we know Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:

Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets
Jan's pets = 3 * 6
Jan's pets = 18

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has:

Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets
Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18
Total pets = 28

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a neighborhood pet enthusiast and animal behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We also know that there are two cats for every dog. Since there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * 60 = 120

Now, we can find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180

Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168

To find the total number of pets, we simply add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a focus on sauce preparation. When it comes to cooking canned tomatoes, I always consider the volume and weight of the tomatoes to ensure the best results.

In this case, we're given that Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and we know that the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes. To find the total number of ounces of tomatoes used, we can multiply the sauce volume by 2.

32 ounces (sauce) * 2 = 64 ounces (total tomatoes)

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 16 to find the number of cans used.

64 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/can = 4 cans

Now, we know that each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find the total number of tomatoes used, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes for her last batch of tomato sauce.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a traffic flow expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, let's break it down step by step.

Let x be the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that 5 cars took an exit, so the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25.

We also know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 25, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find 1/4 of 20, we can multiply 20 by 1/4, which is the same as dividing 20 by 4. 20 ÷ 4 = 5. So, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down John's water intake to determine his weekly consumption.

To calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to consider his daily habits. On weekdays, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a total of 3 glasses per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, he drinks 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water on weekdays.

On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass of water before bed, which is a total of 2 glasses per day. Since there are 2 weekend days, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on weekends.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a meteorologist specializing in fog behavior. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the total time it takes to cover the distance. Since the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Distance / Rate

Given that the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes

Time = 42 / 3
Time = 14 minutes

Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a puzzle enthusiast and expert in jigsaw puzzle solving. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of pieces left, let's break it down step by step:

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces.

The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. To find a third of 750, we can divide by 3: 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces her mom placed from the remaining pieces: 750 - 250 = 500.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"

If Amir eats 5 cookies, we can represent this as a ratio: 5 cookies for Amir to 3 times that amount for Cody. To find the total number of cookies Cody eats, we multiply Amir's cookies by 3: 5 * 3 = 15 cookies.

Now, we add the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a materials engineer with expertise in 3D modeling and spatial analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total inner volume of the boxes.

To find the inner volume of one box, we need to subtract the thickness of the walls from the outer dimensions. The outer dimensions are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. So, the inner dimensions are:

Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"Let's break down Frankie's TV watching schedule to determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, which is equivalent to 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

To find the time he watched on Wednesday, we subtract the total time watched on other days from the total time watched: 7 - (2 + 1.5 + 2) = 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total minutes by 30: 90 / 30 = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this cookie conundrum.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's denote the number of cookies he baked last year as x.

This year, he actually baked 2x + 15 cookies, but then dropped 5, leaving him with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies. We know that this total equals 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we'll subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 50

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The total cost of gas can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback amount can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the cashback per gallon:

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of gas to get the final cost:

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To find the total number of fruit roll-ups, we need to multiply the width by the length for each person.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine engineer with expertise in fluid dynamics and boat design. I'd be happy to help you with Julia's situation.

To determine the amount of water Julia's boat took on, we need to calculate the rate at which the boat is taking on water and then multiply it by the total distance she rows.

First, let's find Julia's rowing speed. We know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate her speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Now, we need to find the rate at which the boat takes on water. We're told that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet. We can express this as a rate:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Finally, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a photography enthusiast and expert in analyzing image storage capacity. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and it's 6 times more than Brittany's phone. To find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we can divide 1800 by 6.

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

Now, we're told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. To find the number of ducks, we can divide 300 by 50.

300 / 50 = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a carpentry expert with extensive experience in managing lumber inventory and pricing. I'd be happy to help you calculate Sasha's profit.

To determine the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we can multiply the number of boards by the cost per board:

10 boards * $10 per board = $100

Similarly, for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

5 boards * $16 per board = $80

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of boards:

$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

10 boards * $15 per board = $150

And the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

5 boards * $24 per board = $120

Now, let's add the total revenue from both types of boards:

$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, to find the profit, we'll subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a logistics expert with extensive experience in managing container shipments. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day, so the total number of vehicles already present at the port is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in salary calculations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find Adrien's current salary, we need to calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

30% of $40000 = 0.3 * 40000 = $12000
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $12000 = $52000

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of $30769.23 = 0.4 * 30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

Now, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $52000 + $43077.92
Total salary = $95077.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95077.92."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and paper usage expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a month. Since there are 2 pads of paper per week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of pads per week by the number of weeks per month.

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and she puts stamps on one-third of them. To find out how many letters were stamped, we can divide the total number of letters needing stamps by 3.

Number of letters stamped = Total letters needing stamps / 3
= 60 / 3
= 20

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began, we need to subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current number of letters in the pile.

Number of letters in the pile when Jennie began = Current number of letters in the pile - Number of letters stamped
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a passion for solving everyday problems. Today, I'm happy to help you figure out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought.

In the end, she had 12 spoons. We can represent the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as 'x'. We can set up an equation based on the information:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

Amy's friends = 50 + 20
Amy's friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we simply add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: 50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a local market analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the cost calculation for Dillon's shopping trip.

To determine the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a healthcare consultant with expertise in hospital operations and financial analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both patient visits and doctor charges, as well as the hospital's operational costs.

Let's break it down:

1. Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

2. Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

3. Total revenue from doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

4. Total revenue: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

As there are no operational costs mentioned, we can directly calculate the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $130,000 - $0
Profit = $130,000

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with your order calculation.

To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each item:

- 2 subs at $7.50 each: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00
- 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00
- 2 cookies at $1.00 each: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Next, we need to calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the total cost. To find 20% of $20.00, we multiply $20.00 by 0.20.

$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00

For the first test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

For the second test, Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, he left 75 - 70 = 5 questions incomplete.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a candy connoisseur and expert in gumball dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We're given that there are 12 blue gumballs. To find the number of pink gumballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * Number of blue gumballs + 22
= 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.

The final answer is: 70"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on vehicle rental management. I'd be happy to help you determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the available fleet.

To calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars. We know that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. The remaining cars are semi-automatic.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars in the fleet is 20%."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bee enthusiast and apiarist. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the number of worker bees, we need to understand the relationships between the different types of bees in the hive. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the total number of bees is 700.
2. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, we can represent the number of baby bees as B. Then, the number of worker bees is 2B.
3. We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is 2Q. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2Q = B.
4. Substituting B = 2Q into the equation for worker bees, we get: 2(2Q) = 4Q.
5. Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of bees: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.
6. Combining like terms, we get: 7Q = 700.
7. Solving for Q, we find: Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate Jordan's potential earnings if he spent his video game time working, we need to determine the total hours he would work in a week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours every day, we can multiply the number of hours he plays per day by the number of days in a week.

Total hours worked in a week = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, we can multiply the total hours worked by his hourly wage to find his total earnings.

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
= 14 hours/week * $10/hour
= $140/week

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in a week if he spent his video game time working.

Final answer: $140"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of John's purchases.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total cost of non-food items and add the cost of food items. Non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The tax on these items is 10%.

First, let's calculate the total cost of non-food items:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we'll calculate the tax on non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, let's add the tax to the total cost of non-food items:
$10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of non-food items with tax is $11.

Moving on to the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Now, let's add the total cost of food items to the total cost of non-food items:
$11 + $5 = $16

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $16.

Final answer: $16"
"As a financial analyst, I've reviewed the situation and calculated the profit for Kim's housekeeping business. To determine the profit, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract it from the total income.

Kim's total expenses consist of the cost of bleach and cloths for all 8 clients. The cost of bleach is 16 bottles * $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is 8 packs * $5 per pack.

Total expenses = (16 bottles * $2) + (8 packs * $5)
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Now, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a horticulturist specializing in tropical fruit cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples per year and then divide it by the frequency of harvesting.

First, let's calculate the total number of pineapples per year:
10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):
1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this lego puzzle.

To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces.
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bee enthusiast and apiarist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

Debra starts by observing 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of those bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

Next, in the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"As a museum enthusiast and a math enthusiast, I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Brittany's mom buys 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. To find the total cost, we need to add these two amounts together.

Total cost = Cost of adult ticket + Cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Total cost = Amount given to cashier - Change received
$22 = Amount given to cashier - $8

To find the amount given to the cashier, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by adding $8 to both sides of the equation:

$22 + $8 = Amount given to cashier
$30 = Amount given to cashier

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a social media analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we can divide Charlie's friends by 3.

Dorothy's friends = Charlie's friends / 3
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4.

James' friends = Dorothy's friends * 4
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference between their times.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute, so his time is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute, so his time is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between their times. The time Tim will be waiting for Steve is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food scientist specializing in snack food dynamics. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the original number of french fries in the pack, let's break down the events that occurred:

1. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the original amount. If we let x be the original amount, then 1/3 of x is equal to 5. We can set up the equation: (1/3)x = 5. To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3, resulting in x = 5 * 3 = 15.

However, this is not the original amount, as the raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries. To find the original amount, we need to account for the raccoon's action. Let's call the original amount y. The raccoon ate 2/3 of y, leaving 1/3 of y. We know that 1/3 of y is equal to 15. We can set up the equation: (1/3)y = 15. To solve for y, we multiply both sides by 3, resulting in y = 15 * 3 = 45.

2. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, leaving 36 fries. We can set up an equation: 45 - 9 = 36. This confirms our previous calculation.

3. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. We can set up an equation: 45 - 7 = 38. However, we know that Dave ate 14 fries initially, so we can set up another equation: 45 - 14 = 31. This confirms our previous calculation.

4. Dave ate 14 fries initially. We can set up an equation: x = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and student. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry expert with a passion for baking. Today, I'm excited to help you with the problem of calculating the total length of Bill's baked goods.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together. Let's start by converting the length of each item to feet.

The rolls are 4 inches long, and there are 300 of them. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls to feet by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The chocolate croissants are 6 inches long, and there are 120 of them. We can convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are 2 feet long, and there are 60 of them. Since they are already in feet, we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"As a zookeeper, I need to ensure that I have enough bananas to feed all the apes in the zoo for 2 months. To calculate the total number of bananas required, I'll add up the monthly needs of each species.

The monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.
The gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.
The baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas.

To last for 2 months, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and athletic coach. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. Let's break it down step by step.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he's running back and forth, we need to multiply the distance by 2 (to account for the return trip). So, Blake's total distance is 15 * 2 * 100 yards = 3000 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so her total distance is 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 3000 = 3120 yards.

The final answer is: 3120"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating compound interest and exponential growth. I'd be happy to help you determine the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, considering a 20% increase every two months.

To calculate the price after 36 months, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price ($20)
r = monthly interest rate (20%/year / 12 months/year = 1.67%/month)
n = number of periods (36 months / 2 months = 18 periods)

A = 20(1 + 0.0167)^18
A ≈ 20(1.0167)^18
A ≈ 20(1.3093)
A ≈ $26.196

However, since the price increases every 2 months, we need to calculate the price after 18 periods (9 increases). We can use the formula for compound interest with a continuous compounding period:

A = Pe^(rt)

Where:
A = final price
P = initial price ($20)
e = base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
r = monthly interest rate (1.67%/month)
t = number of periods (18 months / 2 months = 9 periods)

A = 20e^(0.0167*9)
A ≈ 20(1.0167)^9
A ≈ 20(1.1523)
A ≈ $23.046

To find the price after 36 months, we need to add the 9 increases:

Price after 36 months = $23.046 + 9 * $4.80 (since the price increases by 20% every 2 months)
= $23.046 + $43.52
= $66.566

Rounding to two decimal places, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $66.57.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $66.57."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of the toys.

To find the total cost, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the cost of a red car:
R = $4

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

"As a financial analyst, I'd be happy to help Jackie make an informed decision about whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant.

When calculating the potential income loss if Jackie does her taxes herself, we need to consider the opportunity cost of her time. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which translates to a loss of $35 per hour. To find the total loss, we can multiply the number of hours by the hourly wage:

3 hours * $35/hour = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We're given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we let Seth's current age be x, then Brooke's current age would be x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify, let's first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51.

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate Jessica's monthly and annual debt payments.

To determine the total monthly payment, we need to add up the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in food preparation and kitchen management. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the time it takes Billy to prepare the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.

To determine the total time required, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. Since the potatoes are roughly the same size, we can assume it takes the same amount of time to peel and cut each one.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

First, let's convert the time to cut one potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes

To convert the total time to seconds, we multiply by 60: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds

So, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: 5699.94"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in cost-benefit analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade, and we need to determine how much they spent on lemons. To do this, we'll first calculate their total revenue and total cost.

The selling price of each glass is $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. So, the revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

Since they need lemons for 1 gallon, the cost of lemons is $35.

The final answer is: $35"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

Total number of Asians = 240
Number of Japanese = 80
Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since we know the total number of Chinese participants and the number of Chinese boys, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100.

The final answer is 100."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate how much he has left.

To find out how much Zaid has left after all his expenses and donations, we need to calculate the amount he spends and subtract it from his total income.

Zaid's monthly income is $6000.

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist specializing in crustacean populations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of crabs, we need to first determine the number of crabs each person has.

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math tutor with expertise in calculating earnings. Let's break down Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks.

To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and add them together. 

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.

Number of votes the winner got = (3/4) * 80
= 60

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:
80 - 60 = 20

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a floristry expert with over 10 years of experience in managing flower orders and deliveries. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of red roses that need to be delivered, let's break down the information provided. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. We also know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can express this as 5x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. So, we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is 4x:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago. To find Mark's current age, we need to calculate half of Jan's age two years ago and then add 5 to it.

Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. Then, Mark's age two years ago was 15 + 5 = 20. Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Now, we know Mark's current age is 22 years old. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is 22 + 2 = 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports analytics expert. I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team. 

The first team's time is 55 seconds per runner, and they have four runners. So, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The second team's time is calculated as follows: the first runner runs 60 seconds, the second runner runs 3 seconds faster (60 - 3 = 57 seconds), the third runner runs 3 seconds faster than the second runner (57 - 3 = 54 seconds), and the fourth runner runs 3 seconds faster than the third runner (54 - 3 = 51 seconds). Now, we add the times together: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we can use the formula:

P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

In this case, the favorable outcomes are rolling a 4, 5, or 6, which gives us 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is 6, since there are 6 sides on the die.

P(A) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. We can use the same formula:

P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

In this case, the favorable outcomes are rolling a 2, 4, or 6, which gives us 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is still 6.

P(A) = (2/6) * (2/6) = 4/36 = 1/9 = 0.1111

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the two probabilities:

Difference in probability = 0.5 - 0.1111 = 0.3889

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference in probability = 0.3889 * 100% ≈ 38.89%

So, Jerry is approximately 38.89% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: 38.89%"
"As an agricultural specialist, I can help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mom's total by 2.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

To find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Mom's apples + Jenna's apples
Total apples = 20 + 10
Total apples = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife enthusiast and animal behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw, and a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw. The total straw used for these animals is 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70.

Since the total straw used for all animals is 160, the remaining straw is used for the rats. So, the total straw used for rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, we know that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, and there are 90 pieces of straw for the rats. To find the number of rats, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 6.

Number of rats = Total straw used for rats / 6
= 90 / 6
= 15

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total number of rats by 3 to find the number of rats in each cage.

Number of rats in each cage = Total number of rats / 3
= 15 / 3
= 5

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount Mandy should pay to Benedict.

To calculate the interest, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months. However, since the interest is compounded monthly, we need to convert the time from months to a fraction of a year. There are 12 months in a year, so 3 months is equivalent to 3/12 or 1/4 of a year.

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * (1/4)
Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 0.25
Interest = $5

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should pay to Benedict.

Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $5
Amount to be paid = $105

The final answer is: $105"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a supply chain management expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost. Let's break it down step by step.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold. Since the selling price is $30 per bag, we can represent the total revenue as 30x, where x is the number of bags sold.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation. The cost of buying the bags is $20 per bag, and the cost of transportation is $2 per bag. So, the total cost can be represented as 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total cost of the food, we need to subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets.

Cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The total cost of the rides is given as $66.

Now, we need to find the total cost of all expenses.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a forestry expert with a focus on forest ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 trees per year. However, he also chops down 2 trees annually. To find the total number of trees he has after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees.

First, let's calculate the total number of trees Tom plants in 10 years:

10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees

Since Tom chops down 2 trees per year, we subtract the total number of trees he chops down from the total number of trees he plants:

100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees

Now, 30% of the trees die. To find 30% of 80 trees, we multiply 80 by 0.3:

80 * 0.3 = 24 trees

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

80 trees - 24 trees = 56 trees

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and an eraser costs $0.30. To find the cost of a pen, we simply add these two amounts together.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a Pokémon enthusiast and expert in Pokémon card collecting. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month. Since she collected three times the number of cards she initially had, which is 20, we can calculate this as 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

Next, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, we subtract 20 from the number of cards collected in the first month: 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Now, let's calculate the number of cards collected in the third month. She collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 60 + 40 = 100. Twice this amount is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Finally, let's add up the cards from each month: 20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"As a copy-editor, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total amount Mark makes in a week.

Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher as x. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate the amount he earns from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A is:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B is:

500 sentences * 10 cents = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Carl's cheese consumption for the week.

Carl's daily cheese intake can be calculated by adding the slices used for lunch, breakfast, and dinner. 

For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. To find the total number of pens she had before buying more, we simply add these two quantities:

22 (green pens) + 10 (yellow pens) = 32 pens

Next, Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens, and each bag of red pens contains 6 pens. We can calculate the total number of pens in each color by multiplying the number of bags by the number of pens per bag:

6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens of each color to the initial total:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem.

To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the total score she needs for an average of 93. Since she can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then subtract the lowest score.

The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. The lowest score is 71, so we subtract it from the total score: 438 - 71 = 367.

Now, we need to find the total score for six tests to achieve an average of 93. We multiply the desired average by 6: 93 * 6 = 558.

Finally, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 558 - 367 = 191.

So, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 * 40g = 1000g

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of cakes Rose bought, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and add them together.

On Monday, she bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76

The total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cost accountant with 5 years of experience in analyzing and solving financial problems. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To find the cost of each cup, we need to first calculate the total cost of 20 dozen cups. We know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. So, the total cost of 20 dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

Now, we need to find the cost of each cup. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups. To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $4800 ÷ 240 cups = $20 per cup.

The final answer is: $20"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to earn. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 = $50.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $50 - $10 = $40 more.

She earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to earn $40, we can divide $40 by $5, which is 8 sessions.

However, we also need to consider the lawn mowing sessions. Since she earns $4 per session, we can divide $40 by $4, which is 10 sessions.

Since 8 babysitting sessions would not be enough to cover the cost, we need to find the least common multiple of 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 40 / 4 = 10 times to earn $40.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a poultry expert with a focus on chicken behavior and egg production. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, while the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can represent the number of white chickens as 'r + 2'.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: 4"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast and spatial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the time Gary spends walking around the park.

To find the total time Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the park and divide it by his walking speed. Since the park is a rectangle, we can use the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can plug in the values:

Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed of 3 miles/hour to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to first find the total number of customers on the first two days. 

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We know that this sum is equal to 250.

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150).

To find the number of customers on the third day, we know that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

where y is the number of customers on the third day. We already know that x = 100 and x + 50 = 150, so we can substitute these values:

100 + 150 + y = 500

Combine like terms:

250 + y = 500

Subtract 250 from both sides:

y = 250

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water treatment engineer with a passion for solving problems related to fluid dynamics and leak management. I'd be happy to help you with this water leak problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We have two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting 2x - 16 for 4y in the first equation: 2x - 16 = 2(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 2x - 32. This equation is true for all values of x, so we need to use the second equation to find the value of x.

Substituting x - 16 for y in the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 4x - 64. Adding 64 to both sides, we get 2x + 48 = 4x. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 48 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 24.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 24 - 16 = y, so y = 8.

The small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we can use a simple division problem.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items: $320 (shoes) + $32 (belt) = $352.

Now, we'll divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage: $352 ÷ $8 = 44.

To find the number of hours Lori needs to work, we can round up to the nearest whole number since she can't work a fraction of an hour. However, in this case, the result is a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.

Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

Final answer: 44"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with Janeth's loan repayment.

To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is 10% of $2000, which is $200.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months:

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"

To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of dahlias and add it to the number of roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can simply add 7 to the number of roses.

Number of roses = 4
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11

Total number of flowers = 4 + 11 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Harriet's current age is 21 years, and she is half the age of Zack. To find Zack's age, we can simply multiply Harriet's age by 2.

Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 * 21
Zack's age = 42 years

Now, we know Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. So, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:

Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 * 21
Adrian's age = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

Average age = (Harriet's age + Zack's age + Adrian's age) / 3
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3
Average age = 135 / 3
Average age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251. Naomi scored 68 points. To find out how many points the other three students scored, we need to subtract Naomi's points from the total.

251 - 68 = 183

Now, we know that Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

We also know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna. 68 + 44 + 85 = 197

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by the other three students from the total points.

251 - 197 = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water conservation specialist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the water tank was filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

Next, she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. This means she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water to the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert. Let's calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants.

To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can represent the number of petunias as 90 - 40.

Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."

"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a Pokémon expert and card collector. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a puzzle enthusiast and expert in puzzle completion strategies. I'd be happy to help you solve this puzzle.

To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement. Since Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, we can calculate her mom's rate as 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Now, let's add their rates together: 4 (Kalinda's rate) + 2 (her mom's rate) = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute).

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a horticulturist with expertise in crop management and yield prediction. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took 36 home. This means that 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.

The remaining watermelons on the farm are 120 - 36 = 84.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we need to calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Now, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating business expenses. Let's break down the costs associated with Mark's fleet of cars.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. Since Mark pays 10% tax on the cars, we can calculate it as 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

Finally, we need to add the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car for 12 cars, totaling $12,000.

Now, let's add up the costs: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells on Monday + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, we know that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we can multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

One-third of the penguins (36) jumped into the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third of the penguins went inside the cave to eat their dinner, which is also 12 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert with a focus on fruit production. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes required per week. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

Steve's weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Since his girlfriend eats half of that amount, her weekly consumption is:

Girlfriend's weekly consumption = 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Now, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To calculate the number of vines required, we can divide the total number of tomatoes needed by the number of tomatoes produced per vine:

Number of vines needed = Total tomatoes needed / Tomatoes per vine
= 42 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine
= 14 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to produce enough tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. When it comes to ordering pizzas, I always make sure to consider the number of slices needed to ensure everyone gets their fair share.

To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use a simple division problem. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and John wants each of his 20 friends to have 4 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices needed as follows:

Total slices needed = Number of friends * Slices per friend
Total slices needed = 20 * 4
Total slices needed = 80

Now, to find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age by adding 5 to Jessa's age:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. To find Mary's age, we subtract 2 from Joan's age:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

To find the sum of their ages, we add Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a student of mathematics. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we need to follow the steps below:

First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as:

Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 1000
= (30/100) * 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after 300 students went out through exit A:

Number of students remaining = 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we can calculate this as:

Number of students who went out through exit B = (3/5) * 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420 students

Finally, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit C:

Number of students who went out through exit C = Number of students remaining - Number of students who went out through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. To find out how many candies Robert has, we can divide John's total by 2:

54 ÷ 2 = 27

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can add 6 to Robert's total:

27 + 6 = 33

Now, we can compare the number of candies John and James have:

John has 54 candies, and James has 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' total from John's total:

54 - 33 = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mathematics enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to consider the books each person has and the books they will read from the other person.

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 (her own books) + 2 (books from Pandora) = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 (her own book) + 1 (book from Dolly) = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read is 6."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mathematics enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts. 

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week. Since he receives and sends 3 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages he writes per week is 3 * 5 = 15 pages.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time he spends writing per week by multiplying the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page. This gives us 15 * 6 = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a telecommunications expert. Let's break down Jason's phone plan usage to determine how many minutes he has left.

To calculate the total minutes used, we need to consider the daily call with his boss and the extra minutes used for calls to other people. 

First, let's calculate the total minutes used for the daily call with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is:

450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Then, Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin was left with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After that, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We are given that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. We can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist specializing in aquatic ecosystems. I'd be happy to help you with this snail-filled problem.

Let's dive into the details. We have two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28. This difference is also equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can represent the number of fish as 'x'. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

32 - 4 = 2x
28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a makeup artist with extensive experience in film and television productions. I'd be happy to help you with the calculation.

To determine the total amount Jean paid, we need to calculate the total hours worked and then apply the discount.

First, let's calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost without the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

Now, let's apply the 10% discount: 10% of $30,000 = 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with calculating the cost per person for Isabelle's party expenses.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total calories from the total cookies eaten by each of them.

First, we know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we multiply the total cookies by 200.

Total calories consumed by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
Total calories consumed by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue.

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break it down step by step. We know that the school has 3 classes, and the total number of students is 20 per class. Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

The total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rick's hunting activities can be analyzed using basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we know Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

To find out how many cougars he killed today, we subtract 3 from the number of cougars he killed last night: 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed: 
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
- Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water park enthusiast and a math whiz. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we need to calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find out how many times Robert went down the slide, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4.

Robert's water slide rides = 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to first calculate the total number of cows in all 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. 

Initially, there were 20 cows in each stall, so the total number of cows in 20 stalls is:
20 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 400 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a forestry expert with a focus on tree biology and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we need to first determine the number of 10-foot sections in the tree. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we can divide the total height by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this fruit-filled puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. To find out how many apples Jamal has, we can subtract 8 from 52:

52 - 8 = 44

So, Jamal has 44 apples.

Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can find out how many bananas Jamal has by adding 4 to 44:

44 + 4 = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:

48 ÷ 2 = 24

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have:

76 + 92 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a baking expert with extensive experience in measuring ingredients for various recipes. When it comes to baking cookies, I always emphasize the importance of accurate measurements to ensure the best results.

To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies she's making and then divide that by 12, since 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Now, let's divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies ÷ 12 = 5.5

Since Carla can't buy a fraction of a cup of flour, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure she has enough flour. However, in this case, 5.5 cups of flour will be sufficient.

Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Final Answer: The final answer is 5.5."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist with expertise in tree species and their growth patterns. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.

To find the number of trees Harry has, we need to calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has and then add 5. Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. Adding 5 to that gives us 6 + 5 = 11 trees.

Now, to find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

11 (Harry's trees) - 3 (Ferdinand's trees) = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Carmen has $100. Since Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, we can calculate Samantha's amount as follows:

Samantha's amount = Carmen's amount + $25
Samantha's amount = $100 + $25
Samantha's amount = $125

Next, we're told that Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. So, we can calculate Daisy's amount as follows:

Daisy's amount = Samantha's amount + $50
Daisy's amount = $125 + $50
Daisy's amount = $175

Now, let's add up the amounts to find the total:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a real estate expert with extensive knowledge of the home buying process. I'd be happy to help you determine the total cost of the property and how it compares to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

To calculate the total price of the house, we need to add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, and the transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

To find the difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in cooking and kitchen management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total time it takes to cook the chicken, we need to break down the process into three stages: heating up the oil, heating the oil to the desired temperature, and cooking the chicken.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 300 degrees. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to reach this temperature.

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Since it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes, we can calculate this as follows:

Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 40% of 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 0.4 * 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 8 minutes
= 28 minutes

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. So, the cooking time is:

Time to cook the chicken = Time to heat up the oil - 5 minutes
= 28 minutes - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

Now, let's add up the time it takes for each stage:

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees + Time to cook the chicken
= 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes
= 71 minutes

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home decor expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of windows in John's houses, we need to consider both the bedrooms and the additional windows. 

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 3 bedrooms in each of the 2 houses, we can multiply the number of bedrooms by the number of windows per bedroom and then by the number of houses:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we need to add the number of additional windows in each house, which is 4. Since there are 2 houses, we multiply the number of additional windows per house by the number of houses:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a knitting expert with a passion for pattern design. I'd be happy to help you with your sweater project.

To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, let's break down the information given:

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar:
Collar stitches = 900 / 10 = 90 stitches

Next, we'll calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:
Rostette stitches = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches.

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
Sleeve stitches = 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
Sleeve stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315 stitches

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a theater production specialist. I'd be happy to help you with Sean's line memorization.

To calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break it down:

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, let's add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we need to calculate the number of cards that don't have the letters A, B, or C. 

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Next, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24.

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 * 24 = 15.

To find the number of cards with the letter D, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9.

The final answer is 9."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a landscape designer with expertise in garden planning and maintenance. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to multiply the number of holes by the time it takes to dig each type of hole.

Time for small holes: 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes
Time for large holes: 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mico and Marco want to know their combined age in 10 years. We know that their current combined age is 20. To find their combined age in 10 years, we need to add 10 to each of their current ages and then add those two results together.

Let's denote Mico's current age as x and Marco's current age as y. We know that x + y = 20. In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10).

We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: (x + y) + 20. Since we know that x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the expression:

20 + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. We can represent Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. This gives us our first equation:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This leads to our second equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's simplify and solve for S. We can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a herpetologist specializing in snake species. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so the total number of spots is:
40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800
60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100
Total spots = 2800 + 2100 = 4900

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food and event planning expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game.

To determine the total number of pizzas needed, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the event. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

Adding the team members and coaches, we get 12 + 3 = 15. Including the guests, the total number of people is 15 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many pizzas are required. 39 ÷ 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a jewelry designer with expertise in creating exquisite pieces. When it comes to designing necklaces, I always consider the balance between the gemstones and the space between them. In Katerina's case, she uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, each 1 inch long, and fills the space between them with sterling silver beads, which are 1/4 inch long.

To find the total length of the space between the gemstones, I subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, I divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches ÷ (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to find the number of stories each child wrote in the second week and add them to the number of stories they wrote in the first week.

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the number of stories each child wrote in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we need to add 3 to his current age. Since Ann's brother is twice Ann's age, we can calculate his current age by multiplying Ann's age by 2.

Ann's current age = 9 years
Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's current age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18 years

Now, let's add 3 to the brother's current age to find his age in 3 years:
Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21 years

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a flag design enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on a 76-star flag, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the flag has three rows of 8 stars, which accounts for 3 * 8 = 24 stars. Additionally, there are two rows of 6 stars, contributing 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 

Now, we subtract the total number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag: 76 - (24 + 12) = 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

Since each row has 5 stars, we can find the number of 5-star rows by dividing the remaining stars by 5: 40 ÷ 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in speed and distance calculations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we need to first find the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this counting conundrum.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
2. Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
3. The total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's call this number x. So, we can set up the equation: 10x = 39.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 ÷ 10 = 3.9.

However, since the number of medals must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a medal. Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9 ≈ 3 (rounding down).

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have 4 adults and 8 children sharing 8 packets of chocolate bars, with each packet containing 5 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars each child will get.

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children: 40 - 24 = 16.

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. To do this, we divide 16 by 8, which equals 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Susan's earnings.

To determine how much Susan earns, we need to calculate the total number of minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

Total minutes = (11 a.m. - 8 a.m.) * 60
Total minutes = 3 hours * 60
Total minutes = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 
Time worked = 180 - 30
Time worked = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

Earnings = (Time worked / 10) * 5
Earnings = (150 / 10) * 5
Earnings = 15 * 5
Earnings = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have three friends, Mike, Jim, and Tony, and we know their initial point scores after 3 rounds. Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.

To find Jim's initial points, we subtract 3 from Mike's points: 21 - 3 = 18.

To find Tony's initial points, we multiply Mike's points by 2: 21 * 2 = 42.

Now, let's consider the fourth round. Each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike and Tony have more than 20 points, so they'll get an extra point each. Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he won't get an extra point.

After the fourth round, we update each player's points:

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

To find the total points, we add up the points of all three players: 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutritionist with expertise in household food planning and consumption analysis. I'd be happy to help you determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members.

To calculate the weekly rice consumption, we need to consider the amount of rice each person consumes per meal and the number of meals per day. Assuming each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner), the total daily rice consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

With 5 members in the household, the total daily rice consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly rice consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, let's divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg) to determine how many weeks it will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bakery management consultant. I'd be happy to help you with Sam's bread sales.

To determine how many crates Sam was short of his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. We know he sold 20 crates over the weekend, and the remaining crates were sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

Let's calculate the total number of crates sold:
Crates sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 15 + 12 + 18 = 45
Crates sold over the weekend: 20
Total crates sold: 45 + 20 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can find the difference by subtracting the total crates sold from the target:
120 - 65 = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

To calculate the final cost, we need to consider the sequence of bids. The initial bid was $200, and each subsequent bid increased by $50. Since there were three other bidders, the bids rose three times.

The sequence of bids is as follows:

1. Initial bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Fourth bid: $300 + $50 = $350
5. Fifth bid (Carmen's first bid): $350
6. Sixth bid: $350 + $50 = $400
7. Seventh bid (Carmen's second bid): $400
8. Eighth bid: $400 + $50 = $450

Carmen's final bid was $450, which is the last bid before she won the desk.

The total cost of the desk is the sum of all the bids, which is $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 + $450 = $1650.

The final answer is: $1650."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on logistics and cost analysis. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of John's driving service.

To determine the total cost of driving, we need to calculate the total miles driven per year. Since John drives to work and back, the total distance per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. With a 5-day workweek, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Multiplying this by the number of weeks in a year (50 weeks), we get the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 bonus per month, which amounts to $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 per year.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a book enthusiast and a numbers whiz. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Elise has 250 books in total and has sold 45 books this year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let x be the number of books sold in the first year. Then, the number of books sold in the current year is 2x. We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200 (250 - 50 unsold books). So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

3x = 200

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 66.67 (round down to 67, since you can't sell a fraction of a book)

So, Elise sold 67 books in the first year. Now, we can find the number of books sold in the current year:

2x = 2 * 67 = 134

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

134 * 20 = 2680

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. Since it costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, we can express this as: Flight ticket = 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the items purchased so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to consider the daily egg consumption of the family members. There are 5 family members in total. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, and the remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat 3 eggs each day:
3 people x 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat 2 eggs each day:
2 people x 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day

Now, we add the total number of eggs consumed by both groups to find the daily total:
9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7 to find the weekly total:
13 eggs/day x 7 days = 91 eggs/week

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.

The final answer is: 91"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. To find Trent's age, we can add 5 to Jane's age:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a demographer with expertise in population studies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the current population of Chile, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Noah's current age: Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

2. Find the population of Chile six years ago: The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's current age
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 52
Population of Chile six years ago = 156,000

3. Find the current population of Chile: Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Current population of Chile = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
Current population of Chile = 156,000 * 2
Current population of Chile = 312,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 312,000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{312,000}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and football strategist. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of players on the team is 105. We also know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, and half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

We can write the equation to represent the total number of players: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a party planning expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so we multiply 2 by 6 to get 12 people. Then, there are 3 families with 4 people each, so we multiply 3 by 4 to get 12 people. Adding these together, we get 12 + 12 = 24 people invited.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. To find the number of people who still need to attend, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Now, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments. To find this number, we divide 8 by 4, which equals 2. We subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 
   Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 
   2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
   So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
   Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

2. Now, add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
   Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
   Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pool engineer with expertise in calculating the volume and cost of pool fillings. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth. In this case, the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot.

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

Therefore, it will cost $12 to fill the pool.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. If there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom.

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a professional in the field of electrical engineering. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of electric poles required, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is needed.

Given that the total number of electric wires is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required by dividing the total number of electric wires by 3.

Number of electric poles = Total number of electric wires / 3
= 45 / 3
= 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a party planner with expertise in event management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of women left at the party, we need to first determine the total number of people who left. We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' left, and 22 men stayed. We also know that the number of men who left is 3 (since 25 - 22 = 3). We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people is 12, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = (1/4) * 12
= 3

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 3
= 12

However, this is incorrect as we know 3 men left and 10 people left in total. We can re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-evaluate the situation:

We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. We also know that 3 men left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let's denote the total number of people as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' left, and 22 men stayed. We also know that the number of men who left is 3. We can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 3

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 3 * 4
x = 12

Now that we know the total number of people is 12, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = (3/4) * 12
= 9

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 9
= 6

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4. To find the cost of the magazine, we can divide the cost of the book by 2.

Magazine cost = Book cost / 2
Magazine cost = $4 / 2
Magazine cost = $2

Now, we know the magazine costs $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can subtract $1 from the magazine cost to find the cost of the pen.

Pen cost = Magazine cost - $1
Pen cost = $2 - $1
Pen cost = $1

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. To find the number of pencils in each box, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of boxes and the loose pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

To solve for 'x', we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 24

Now, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 8

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add the pencils Jam has to the pencils Meg has:

3 * 8 (pencils per box) + 2 (loose pencils) = 26 (Jam's pencils)
26 + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed:

72 / 24 = 3

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 3"
"As a coffee connoisseur and a barista, I'd be happy to help you calculate the weakening of Shannon's iced coffee.

To determine the total weakening of the coffee, we need to consider two factors: the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the dilution effect of the added cream.

First, let's calculate the weakening caused by the cooling. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, and the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes used as follows:

Number of ice cubes = Total cooling / Cooling per ice cube
= 65 / 13
= 5

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the total weakening caused by the cooling is:

Weakening due to cooling = Number of ice cubes * Weakening per ice cube
= 5 * 12
= 60 milliliters

Next, let's consider the dilution effect of the added cream. Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening caused by the cooling and the dilution effect of the cream:

Total weakening = Weakening due to cooling + Weakening due to dilution
= 60 + 15
= 75 milliliters

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm a music enthusiast with a passion for record collecting. As a seasoned collector, I've had my fair share of trading records with fellow enthusiasts. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To solve this, we need to understand the trade ratio. Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one, we can set up a simple equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of old records brought in as 'x'. Since 5 people came in and left with 7 new records, we can set up the equation:

2x = 7

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 ÷ 2
x = 3.5

However, since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, it's more logical to assume that each person brought in 3 old records, as it's a more reasonable number for a trade.

Now, we can multiply the number of people by the number of old records each person brought in:

5 people * 3 old records/person = 15 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 15 old records.

The final answer is: 15"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a software engineer with expertise in salary calculations and programming industry standards. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, let's find the number of junior programmers. Since they make up 2/5 of the total employees, we can calculate this as:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * Total employees
= (2/5) * 100
= 40

Next, we know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the salary of a senior programmer is:

Salary of a senior programmer = Salary of a junior programmer + $400
= $2000 + $400
= $2400

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month:

Total amount for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

Similarly, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month:

Total amount for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

Finally, we can find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month by adding the amounts for junior and senior programmers:

Total amount = Total amount for junior programmers + Total amount for senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. We can set up an equation based on the information given:

x = (number of people who got on at the first stop) + (number of people who got on at the second stop) - (number of people who got off at the second stop)

x = 5 + 8 - 7

x = 6

So, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 6.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 out to his friends, which doesn't change the number of lollipops he has, as we're only concerned with the total count. So, he still has 22 lollipops.

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 22 + 28 = 50 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 more that night, leaving him with 50 - 3 = 47 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 47 - 2 = 45 lollipops.

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mobile technology expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. To find the time it takes to charge 40%, we can set up a proportion:

40% / 1% = x / 3 minutes

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3:

x = (40% * 3) / 1%
x = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

x = 120 minutes / 60
x = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm animal expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the total number of legs, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's use 'c' to represent the number of cows. Then, the number of chickens is 2c.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens: 2c = 2(20) = 40 chickens.

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we need to first determine the new daily distance he'll be running. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than his original 5000 meters. This means he'll be running 5000 + (5000 * 1/5) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Since there are 30 days in June, we can multiply the new daily distance by 30 to find the total distance covered in June: 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food and beverage expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we need to calculate the price difference between the two. We know that Juice Box A is $4, Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A.

First, let's find the price of Juice Box B: $4 (Juice Box A) + $5 = $9.

Next, let's find the price of Juice Box C: $4 (Juice Box A) + $7 = $11.

Now, to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a restaurant consultant with expertise in table and chair configurations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to consider the number of legs on each type of table. There are 40 tables with 4 legs and 50 tables with 3 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 4 legs: 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of legs from the tables with 3 legs: 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs.

Now, we'll add the total number of legs from both types of tables: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and the bag contains 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. To find out how many cookies her son eats, we can multiply the number of cookies he eats per day by the number of days:

4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We can calculate the total number of cookies he eats by multiplying the number of cookies he eats per day by the number of days:

1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

Now, let's add the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband:

20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, we can find the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat by subtracting the total number of cookies consumed from the total number of cookies in the bag:

36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of the shirts Davos bought.

To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to calculate the discount on one shirt first. The discount is 40% of the original price of $30. 

Discount on one shirt = 40% of $30 = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total cost of 2 shirts = $18 * 2 = $36

The final answer is: $36"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating revenue and profit margins. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a financial analyst, I've broken down the costs associated with Madeline's dog expenses. To calculate the total yearly cost, we need to consider the monthly expenses.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost of food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the weekly cost of food is $25. Multiplying this by 4 gives us:

$25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. This gives us:

$100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220/month

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

$220/month * 12 months/year = $2,640/year

Therefore, Madeline spends $2,640 per year on her dog.

The final answer is: $2640"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert. I'd be happy to help you with the plant pot donation.

To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and she needs 30 pots for the daisies, she needs 2 * 30 = 60 pots for the roses.

In total, April needs 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots.

Since she already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a travel enthusiast and vacation planner. I'd be happy to help you calculate the time John spent sightseeing.

To determine the total time John spent on vacation, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity. Let's break it down:

Time spent boating: 6 hours
Time spent swimming: 6 / 2 = 3 hours
Time spent watching shows: 3 * 2 = 6 hours
Total time spent on these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time:
0.3x = 15
x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

This means John spent 50 hours on vacation.

To find the time spent sightseeing, we can calculate 40% of the total time:
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Annabelle's savings plan to determine how much she still needs to save for her phone.

To calculate Annabelle's total earnings, we need to consider her earnings from both jobs. Her first job pays $10 per hour, and she worked for 20 hours, resulting in earnings of $200. Her second job pays $5 per hour, and she worked for 15 hours, resulting in earnings of $75. 

Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's add her initial savings: $80 + $275 = $355

To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the phone's price: $400 - $355 = $45

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in tree species and growth patterns. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to first find the height of the second tree. Since the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, we can calculate its height as follows:

Height of the shortest tree = 6 feet
Height of the second tree = 6 + 5 = 11 feet

The combined height of the two shortest trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so it is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem.

Let's break down the costs and calculate how many friends Morgan can invite to her party.

Morgan wants to spend her $90 budget on the following activities:

- A round of mini-golf, which costs $5
- Arcade tokens, which cost $5 per person
- Go-kart rides, which cost $10 per ride and she wants to ride twice

First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities: $5 (mini-golf) + $10 (go-kart ride) + $10 (go-kart ride) = $25.

Now, we need to subtract this total from Morgan's budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we'll divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 ÷ $5 = 12.

So, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

The final answer is: 12"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day and buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. To find out how much she saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this candy conundrum.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Billy had $10 initially. He spent $2 on gumballs, so he had $10 - $2 = $8 left. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($8) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:

$8 ÷ $1.5 = 5.33 pounds

So, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.33}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We know Carver is 45 years old, and his age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can represent Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. So, we have the equation:

C = 2S - 5

Since we know Carver's age, we can substitute 45 for C:

45 = 2S - 5

To solve for S, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation:

45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5

This simplifies to:

50 = 2S

Now, we'll divide both sides by 2 to isolate S:

50 ÷ 2 = 2S ÷ 2

Simplifying, we get:

25 = S

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in route optimization and logistics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of days between train services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then divide it by the service interval.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the third city to the first city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.05 days * 24 hours/day = 1.2 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 72 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 72 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a skilled seamstress specializing in custom dog beds. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the beds.

To determine the amount of stuffing required, we need to calculate the average amount of stuffing for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds. So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in route optimization and travel time calculations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time taken for John's trip, we need to break it down into three parts: the trip to his friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

First, let's calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.86 hours

Next, we need to add the time taken for the detour:
Time = 0.14 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken to drive back home:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours
Total time taken = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: 5.99"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.

Number of boys = Total students - Number of girls
= 96 - 43
= 53

However, we also know that 5 girls and 4 boys were absent on Friday. To find the number of boys present, we need to subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

Number of boys present = Total number of boys - Number of absent boys
= 53 - 4
= 49

So, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is 49."

Number of boys = 6 / 2
Number of boys = 3

Now, we add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park.

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 3 + 6
Total number of kids = 9

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail management expert. I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We also know that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus 5. This can be represented as 4(3) - 5.

To find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting, we need to calculate 4(3) - 5:
4(3) = 12
12 - 5 = 7

So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3(7).

To find the number of customers kicked out for physical violence, we need to calculate 3(7):
3(7) = 21

Now, let's add up the number of customers kicked out for each reason:
3 (refusing to wear masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (physical violence) = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31.

50 - 31 = 19

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19.

Final answer: 19"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to find out how many points Sara had before.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points. We know that Erin scored 14 points, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we need to find Erin's points before she scored 14 points. Since Erin scored 14 points, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points before = Sara's points before + 14
Erin's points before = x + 14

We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara, so we can set up the equation:

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3 * x

Now we can solve for x:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

Now that we know Sara had approximately 4.67 points before, we can find Erin's points before:

Erin's points before = x + 14
Erin's points before = 4.67 + 14
Erin's points before = 18.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the exact number of points Erin had before she scored 14 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18.67}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in budgeting and cost estimation. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of the senior gifts.

To determine the total cost, we need to break down the expenses into separate categories:

1. Picture frames:
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - The logo etching adds 20% of the frame cost, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame: $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 frames: 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. Pins:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in inventory management and cost analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we need to first determine the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. Since the total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000, the amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Total amount spent on all pieces - Amount spent on faulty pieces
= 400,000 - 0.4x

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"

Let's break it down step by step. We have 40 pupils in the class. Half of them like blue, which means 40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green, so we need to find one-fourth of 20. To do this, we can divide 20 by 4: 20 / 4 = 5.

Now, we need to find the number of pupils who like yellow. Since 5 pupils like green, we subtract 5 from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fruit expert with a specialization in orchard management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we need to break down the information provided. We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56 from the sale. Since the price per apple is $4, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount received / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. Since she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of apples picked:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a laundry expert with extensive experience in managing household chores. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: +42 (since Janet gave her cookies)
Cookies eaten by brother: -44 (since it's a subtraction)

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

However, since we can't have a negative number of cookies, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. Let's try again:

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: +42
Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies eaten by brother: -44 (but we can't subtract 44 from 65, since it's more than the total)

To find the correct answer, we need to consider that the brother ate more cookies than Rachel had initially. In this case, we can conclude that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

Final answer: 0"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Karan's monthly payment.

To determine the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total interest and divide it by the number of months. Since Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%, we can use the formula:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008333)^5 ] / (1.008333)^5 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.043383) ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.00875 ] / 1.043383 - 1]
M = $3,650 [ 0.008475 ] 
M = $30.75

The monthly payment Karan has to make is $30.75.

The final answer is: $30.75"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find out how far Cho hiked, we need to multiply the speed by the time. Since Cho hiked at a constant speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Now, let's calculate the distance hiked by Chloe. She hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. We can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract the distance hiked by Chloe from the distance hiked by Cho:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating profit margins. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate her total revenue and total cost. 

First, we find the total revenue by multiplying the number of cups of lemonade sold by the price per cup. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and she sells all 36 cups, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Next, we calculate her total cost, which is the initial investment of $18.

Now, we find her profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find her profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Since she sells all 36 cups in 9 hours, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a land surveyor with expertise in calculating land areas. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can use a simple proportion. Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a music educator with expertise in choir management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Next, we know that half of the people performing can't make it to the show. To find the total number of people performing, we need to add the number of girls (26) and the 3 teachers. This gives us 26 + 3 = 29.

Now, we need to find half of 29. We can calculate this as 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

However, we need to consider that the 3 teachers are also performing. So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how much David saves, let's analyze the situation. David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides. On the other hand, Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, which cost $2 per ticket.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 * $2 = $18. 

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30. 

So, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a crafting expert with extensive experience in gift wrapping. When it comes to creating beautiful bows, I always consider the amount of ribbon I have and the number of gifts I need to wrap.

To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into solving the problem.

We're given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have, which is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we need to first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is 5 + 6 = 11.

Now, we'll divide the total number of popsicles (165) by the total number of parts (11) to find the value of each part: 

165 ÷ 11 = 15

Since the ratio is 5:6, we'll multiply 15 by 6 to find the number of popsicles Sam has: 
Sam's popsicles = 15 * 6 = 90

Next, we'll multiply 15 by 5 to find the number of popsicles Betty has: 
Betty's popsicles = 15 * 5 = 75

To find the difference, we'll subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 
Difference = Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the costs to determine how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable package.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. To find the discounted cost, we calculate 20% of $10, which is $2. So, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus: $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month. To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a music production expert. Let's break down Carol's work time to determine the percentage she spent editing.

To find the total work time, we need to convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the time spent recording as follows:

0.5 hours = 0.5 * 60 minutes = 30 minutes

Now, we can add up the time spent on each activity:

4 hours (writing) + 0.5 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 6 hours

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we can divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many slices Jenny has left, we need to calculate how many slices she gave away and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices. To convert this to a decimal, we can divide 4 by 3, which equals approximately 1.33 slices. However, since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll keep it as a fraction for accuracy.

Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark has $50 in his bank account and wants to buy a bike that costs $300. To determine how many days he needs to save, we need to calculate the remaining amount he needs to earn.

Remaining amount = Cost of the bike - Initial amount
Remaining amount = $300 - $50
Remaining amount = $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days he needs to save by dividing the remaining amount by his daily earnings.

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily earnings
Number of days = $250 / $10
Number of days = 25

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, an entomologist specializing in insect populations. I'd be happy to help you with the bug count.

To calculate the total number of bugs, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's find the number of millipedes. Since Nancy saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * Number of spiders
= (1/3) * 90
= 30

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * Number of millipedes - 12
= 2 * 30 - 12
= 48

Now, let's add up the total number of bugs:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs in her woodshed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica. To find Beth's age, we simply add 5 to Erica's age:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. To find Alice's age, we add 7 to Beth's age:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is simply Alice's age minus Erica's age:

Difference in ages = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference in ages = 42 - 30
Difference in ages = 12

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to first determine the total number of working days in a year. Since the builder works 4 weeks per month and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of weeks worked in a year as follows:

Total weeks worked in a year = 4 weeks/month * 12 months/year = 48 weeks/year

Since the builder works 6 days a week, we can calculate the total number of working days in a year as follows:

Total working days in a year = 48 weeks/year * 6 days/week = 288 days/year

Now, we can multiply the total number of working days by the daily wage to find the total earnings:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home energy auditor. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the energy saved by reducing the time spent using the air conditioner, we need to first find the total energy used in 8 hours a day and then subtract the energy used in 3 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour. To find the total energy used in 8 hours, we multiply the power consumption by the number of hours:

Energy used in 8 hours = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Now, let's find the energy used in 3 hours:

Energy used in 3 hours = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

The energy saved per day is the difference between these two values:

Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert this to kilowatts, we divide by 1000:

Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Finally, let's find the energy saved in 30 days:

Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can represent the number of corns as 2 * 40 = 80.

However, we also know that he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. So, the number of corns he bought is 40 - 40 = 0. Initially, he had 0 corns, and he didn't buy any more, so the number of corns remains 0.

Now, we can find the total number of cannolis by adding the initial number of cannolis to the number of cannolis he bought: 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 0 (initial corns) + 100 (total cannolis) = 100.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a reading specialist. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many minutes early Toby will be at the airport, we need to calculate the time it takes him to finish the book and then subtract the travel time to the airport.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Toby to finish the book. Since he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute and the book is 9000 words long, we can use the following formula:

Time = Total words / Reading rate
Time = 9000 words / 300 words per minute
Time = 30 minutes

Now, we need to add the travel time to the airport, which is 10 minutes. To find out how many minutes early Toby will be, we subtract the travel time from the total time it takes him to finish the book:

Time to finish the book + Travel time = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

Since Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, we subtract the total time from the required arrival time:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Therefore, Toby will be 20 minutes early at the airport.

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in contract labor management. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This means the total amount paid in May is:

40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:

She bought 2 pounds of taffy, with the first pound costing $3 and the second pound being 1/2 off, which is $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each, which is a total of 4 x $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $10 - $7 = $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount Tim spent on fireworks.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks and add the cost of the finale firework. 

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Tim gets a 20% discount on the two packages, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a baking enthusiast and expert in cookie recipes. I'd be happy to help you determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make to last her for 30 days.

To calculate the total number of cookies needed, we can multiply the number of cookies eaten per day (2) by the number of days (30). This gives us a total of 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find out how many dozens she needs.

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies per dozen = 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a quality control specialist with expertise in manufacturing and product safety. I've reviewed the candle production process, and I'm happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of two events: the 5% defect rate and the explosion risk.

First, let's calculate the number of candles with the defect (5% of 50,000):
Number of candles with defect = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500

Since these candles are also more dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that all 2,500 candles with the defect will explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

Final answer: $\boxed{2500}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of the discounted blouses.

To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to calculate the discount amount and then multiply it by the number of blouses. 

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this apple-gathering problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half that amount (15) from the shortest trees, and an unknown amount from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2x) and 3 times as many from the shortest trees (45).

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

30 + 15 + 2x + 45 = 500

Combine like terms:

90 + 2x = 500

Subtract 90 from both sides:

2x = 410

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 205

Now that we know x, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees. Since her sister doesn't gather any from the average trees, the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees is 0.

The final answer is 0."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife expert with a specialization in camel and dromedary behavior. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the number of dromedaries, we can use the information given about the number of heads and bumps. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that camels have two humps each, while dromedaries have one hump each. The total number of bumps is 304, and the total number of heads is 180. We can set up an equation based on this information:

2c + d = 304 ... (Equation 1)
c + d = 180 ... (Equation 2)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of c (camels) and d (dromedaries).

First, let's isolate c in Equation 2:
c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this expression for c into Equation 1:
2(180 - d) + d = 304

Expand and simplify the equation:
360 - 2d + d = 304
360 - d = 304

Subtract 360 from both sides:
-d = -56

Multiply both sides by -1:
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a travel enthusiast and expert in route planning. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip.

To find the total distance, let's break it down into parts. Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:

0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this locker size problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find Zack's locker size, we can multiply Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 4 × 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Now, we know that Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker. To find Timothy's locker size, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 × 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is: 40"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geographer. To find the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between the two points.

The elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the distance Oliver must climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from Stanley's comb elevation.

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7,000}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $8000 = $13000

So, Mr. Josue now has $13000 in capital.

The final answer is: $13000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a feline behaviorist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We start with 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and take away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats taken away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat takes: 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats taken away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3 and then divide by 5: (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in subscription-based services. Let's break down the costs of Bill's streaming service.

To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the service, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, then the rate increases to $12 per month for the next 8 months, and finally, it jumps to $14 per month for the remaining 8 months.

We can calculate the total cost as follows:

- The first 6 months: 6 * $8 = $48
- The next 8 months: 8 * $12 = $96
- The last 8 months: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion expert with a keen eye for style and a passion for numbers. Today, I'm excited to help you solve a problem related to jeans shopping.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. He decided to buy both tattered and jogger jeans, which were on sale. The tattered jeans cost $28, while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

To find the original price of the jogger jeans, we can start by setting up an equation. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means that 2/3 of the savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(2/3)x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

(2/3)x = 2

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 3

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $3, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 3 + 6
= 9

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:
$9 - $3
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with extensive experience in managing large-scale events. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total capacity of the vehicles.

To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The 4 buses have a capacity of 60 employees each, so their total capacity is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.

The 6 minibusses have a capacity of 30 employees each, so their total capacity is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.

The 10 minivans have a capacity of 15 employees each, so their total capacity is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife enthusiast and bird expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She builds 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and cost analyst. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so the soup costs $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a Pokémon enthusiast and collector. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to determine the total amount of money he made from selling the cards and then use that information to calculate the initial number of cards.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash, he must have made $50 from selling the remaining 2/3 of the cards. Let's use the selling price of $1.5 per card to set up an equation:

2/3 * 1.5 = 50

To solve for the total number of cards, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

1.5 * 3/2 = 50 * 3/2

This simplifies to:

2.25 = 75

Now, we can divide both sides by 1.5 to find the total number of cards:

2.25 / 1.5 = 75 / 1.5

x = 50

x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a catering expert with extensive experience in event planning and food preparation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, let's break it down step by step. The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. Since there are 36 guests, half of them would be:

36 guests / 2 = 18 guests

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means the caterer had enough hotdogs for 40 guests to have two hotdogs. To find out how many guests only had one hotdog, we need to subtract the number of guests who had two hotdogs from the total number of guests:

40 guests (with two hotdogs) - 18 guests (with two hotdogs) = 22 guests

Therefore, 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order.

To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:

- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we need to calculate the 20% discount:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your math problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Dora wants to buy three items: a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a playground ball for $2. To find out how much she needs in total, we add the costs of these items:

$6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so we need to find out how much she has in total:

$2 (allowance) + $16 (from mother) = $18

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to calculate the total amount he spent on candy bars. We know he spent $5 in total, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 ÷ 75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"

"Bonjour! As a culinary expert, I'd be delighted to help you calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients. Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound, which equals $8.00.

Additionally, Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box, which equals $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The final answer is: $2."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on urban mobility. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time it takes for her to get to the theater and compare it to Wayne's travel time.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.

Now, if Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 16 minutes to get to the theater, she should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home decor expert. I'd be happy to help you with finding the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom.

To find the perimeter, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet.

Final answer: 98"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home energy efficiency expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature change due to baking and then subtract the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Since the oven raises the house temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase is:

ΔT_baking = 5°C/hour * 3 hours = 15°C

Next, we need to calculate the cooling effect. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total cooling effect is:

ΔT_cooling = 2°C/10 minutes * 30 minutes = 6°C

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_baking - ΔT_cooling
= 40°C + 15°C - 6°C
= 49°C

The final answer is 49."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and triathlon coach. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find James' time for the swim, we need to calculate 10% of Jon's swim time and subtract it from Jon's swim time.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. 10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

For the bike ride, James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

For the run, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes. Since Jon's run time is 50 minutes, James' run time must be 50 + 10 = 60 minutes.

The final answer is 60."

Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
8 bails * $3 per bail = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in baking and cooking. I'd be happy to help you with Rozanne's eggnog conundrum.

To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs each tray can hold.

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. She also has 2 loose eggs, so the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses Rozanne can make by dividing the total number of eggs by 5:
50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses

Now, we know that each tray can hold 5 glasses of eggnog. To find the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by 5:
10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a Scrabble enthusiast and expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many points Joey is winning, we need to calculate the difference between his score and Marcy's score after their turns.

Joey initially had 214 points and scored 26 points, bringing his total to 214 + 26 = 240 points.

Marcy initially had 225 points and scored 10 points, bringing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

Now, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score to find the difference:

240 - 235 = 5

Joey is winning by 5 points.

Final answer: 5"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to find the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 at a flash sale on Monday, and the rest were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:
Revenue from selling 17 sneakers = 17 * $20 = $340

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling the remaining 31 sneakers at $25 each:
Revenue from selling 31 sneakers = 31 * $25 = $775

Now, let's find the total revenue:
Total revenue = Revenue from selling 17 sneakers + Revenue from selling 31 sneakers
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

The total cost is given as $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: $539"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To find the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of colors in each type of packet and add them together.

We know that six packets had 8 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 6 x 8 = 48.

Four packets had 16 colors each, so the total number of colors in these packets is 4 x 16 = 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and you saved $2 by not buying it. So, the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

The cost of the movie ticket is $12. To find the cost of the popcorn, we subtract the cost of the movie ticket from the cost without the super ticket: $17 - $12 = $5.

Now, let's confirm this with the cost of the soda, which is $3. Since the problem states that you bought one popcorn and a soda at regular price, we can set up an equation:

Cost of popcorn + Cost of soda = $5
$3 (soda) + Cost of popcorn = $5

To find the cost of the popcorn, we subtract the cost of the soda from both sides of the equation:
Cost of popcorn = $5 - $3
Cost of popcorn = $2

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cost analyst. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the new cost of filling 20 balloons. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. After the price increase, the cost of filling each balloon was $20 more. So, the new cost of filling each balloon is $900 / 20 + $20 = $55.

Now, we can find the cost of filling 170 balloons: 
$55 * 170 = $9350.

The final answer is $9350."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in calculating average speeds for various road trip scenarios. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then, it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles. The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gemstone appraiser. I'd be happy to help you with the value of Jenna's jewels.

To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. So, she has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires left.

The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

She received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. So, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a magician's card enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know there are 15 red cards, and the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we can calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.

60% of 15 = 0.6 * 15 = 9

Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24

Now, we're told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24 = 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the percentage of puppies with spots.

To find the total number of puppies, we need to add the number of puppies Jennifer's dog has (8) to the number of puppies Brandon's dog has (12).

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%."
"As a farm manager, I can break down the total weight of the feed into its components to determine the number of trips required to transport it.

First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

- 2 boxes of sugar cubes = 2 pounds
- 4 bags of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds
- 42 bales of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
- 20 sacks of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

To find the number of trips, we'll divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds):

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a recycling expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate Grayson's earnings from recycling cans and bottles.

To determine Grayson's weekly earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately. 

She earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day to break in his new shoes, we can divide the total number of minutes (240) by the total number of days (21).

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we can also calculate the daily time by dividing the total time by the number of walking days per week.

240 minutes ÷ 4 days/week = 60 minutes per day

However, this is the total time Jason needs to walk in a week. To find the daily time, we can divide the weekly time by 7.

60 minutes/week ÷ 7 days/week = 8.57 minutes per day

Considering Jason wants to break in the shoes in 3 weeks, we can multiply the daily time by 3.

8.57 minutes/day * 3 weeks = 25.71 minutes per day

However, this is the total time Jason needs to walk in 3 weeks. To find the daily time, we can divide the total time by 21.

25.71 minutes ÷ 21 days = 1.22 minutes per day

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we can divide the daily time by 4.

1.22 minutes/day ÷ 4 days/week = 0.305 minutes per day

To make the calculation more intuitive, we can convert the minutes to hours and minutes.

0.305 minutes ≈ 0.005 hours

0.005 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 0.3 minutes

However, this is the time Jason needs to walk per day to break in the shoes in 3 weeks. To find the daily time, we can divide the total time by 21.

240 minutes ÷ 21 days = 11.43 minutes per day

Since Jason can walk 4 days a week, we can divide the daily time by 4.

11.43 minutes/day ÷ 4 days/week = 2.86 minutes per day

The most accurate answer is 2.86 minutes per day.

"As a travel expert, I'd be happy to help you plan your anniversary getaway.

To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel. The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a music enthusiast and tech-savvy individual. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we need to calculate the difference in their song capacities. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we can represent this as:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs

We know Gabriel has 20 songs, so:

Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player. Since his player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract Luri's songs from 100:

Gabriel's remaining capacity = 100 - 60
Gabriel's remaining capacity = 40

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 40.

The final answer is 40."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm animal nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the amount of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses.

To determine the total amount of oats required, we need to calculate the daily consumption of oats by all four horses and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day. So, the daily consumption of oats per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption of oats is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find out how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to divide the total amount of oats needed by the weight of oats in one bag, which is 50 pounds. So, the number of bags required is 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with your question.

Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are currently on sale for buy one get one free. She also has a $2.00 coupon. To find the cost of each individual razor, we need to first find the total cost of 2 packs of razors.

Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors. The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this human pyramid problem.

To find the total height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the height of each layer and add them together.

The bottom layer has 4 girls, and the average height of these girls is 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

"To determine the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to consider the total cost of each venue. 

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus an additional $5 per guest for food. The total cost for the first venue can be represented as:

C1 = 200 + 5x

The second venue charges $25 per guest, and since food is included, the total cost for the second venue can be represented as:

C2 = 25x

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we set C1 equal to C2 and solve for x:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. Let's dive into the insect collection problem.

We're given that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects together. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's use variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let's say Bodhi found x insects. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of insects collected:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, which we'll call x. She also bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2 and 1 pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2 / 2 = $1.

We know that the total amount she spent is $7. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 2 + 1 = 7.

Now, let's solve for x. First, we'll combine the constants on the left side of the equation: 2x + 3 = 7.

Next, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 7 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = 4.

Finally, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 4 / 2, which simplifies to x = 2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a carpentry expert with a passion for optimizing wood usage. When it comes to making popsicle sticks, I always look for the most cost-effective solution.

To determine the most cost-efficient way to make popsicle sticks, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber. Let's do the math:

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, it's clear that buying 2 x 8 lumber is the way to go. With $24 to spend, we can calculate the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make:

Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600, which is achieved by buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

The final answer is: 1600"

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.
Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, let's add the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bakery management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of loaves left, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of loaves baked and the total number of loaves sold, and then add the number of loaves returned.

Total loaves baked = 200
Loaves sold in the morning = 93
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Now, let's subtract the total loaves sold from the total loaves baked:
Loaves left = Total loaves baked - Total loaves sold
Loaves left = 200 - 132
Loaves left = 68

Finally, we add the number of loaves returned:
Loaves left after return = Loaves left + 6
Loaves left after return = 68 + 6
Loaves left after return = 74

The bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 74."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a utility expert with extensive experience in energy consumption analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to consider her original and new daily consumption rates.

Ada's original daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her original weekly consumption, we multiply this rate by 7 days:

Original weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, her original weekly bill is:

Original weekly bill = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126

Now, let's calculate Ada's new daily consumption with the added device, which consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. Her new daily consumption is:

New daily consumption = 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

Her new weekly consumption is:

New weekly consumption = 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is still $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, her new weekly bill is:

New weekly bill = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is:

Difference = New weekly bill - Original weekly bill
= $147 - $126
= $21

The final answer is: $21"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a construction project manager with expertise in estimating and scheduling. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to first calculate the total man-hours required to complete the job. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the total man-hours for one person to paint a whole house.

Let's break it down:

1 person can paint half a house in 5 days, so 1 person can paint a whole house in 10 days (2 times 5 days).
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours for one person to paint a whole house:
10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since the work is divided among 5 people, we can divide the total hours by 5:
240 hours / 5 people = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 48"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a furniture expert with a keen eye for interior design. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. To find the number of chairs Ophelia has, we can add 2 to the number of sofas: 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can multiply the number of Ophelia's chairs by 3: 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Now, let's add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 108.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on bus operations. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.

Finally, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. Let's calculate James' age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years. Twice James' age in 8 years is 2 x 30 = 60 years. Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age, his cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

To find the current age of James' cousin, subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400. We also know that the computer cost $1,100 and that the printer cost $400 less than the computer. 

To find the cost of the printer, we subtract $400 from the cost of the computer: $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we can find the total cost of the computer and the printer: $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the girls brought 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that George had twice as many candies as Nick. If we let N represent the number of candies Nick had initially, we can express this relationship as an equation: N = 2G, where G represents the number of candies George had.

We also know that George ate 5 candies, leaving him with 3. So, we can set up the equation: G - 5 = 3.

Solving for G, we get: G = 3 + 5 = 8.

Now that we know George had 8 candies, we can substitute this value back into the equation N = 2G to find the number of candies Nick had: N = 2(8) = 16.

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. To find Alyana's age, we can simply subtract 4 from Chenny's age.

Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4
Alyana's age = 10 - 4
Alyana's age = 6

Now, we're told that Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. To find Anne's age, we can add 2 to Alyana's age.

Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2
Anne's age = 6 + 2
Anne's age = 8

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

To triple the amount he had left after spending $8, we multiply $13 by 3, which gives us $13 * 3 = $39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of the month, we first need to determine the total savings for the second half of the month. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can represent the savings in the first half as x. Then, the savings in the second half is 2x.

We know that Elvis's total monthly savings target is $1125. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month, we can find the savings in the second half by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375
2x = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can divide the total savings for the second half by 15 to find out how much Elvis has to save each day:

750 ÷ 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Jeff and Brad are dividing $100 between them, with Jeff receiving 4 times as much as Brad. To solve this, we can use a simple algebraic approach.

Let's represent the amount Brad receives as 'x'. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be represented as 4x. The total amount they have together is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives $20, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying 4 and 20:

Jeff's share = 4x = 4(20) = 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total miles Jeff walks, we need to consider the round-trip distance to and from work. Since he walks to work and back each day, the total distance he covers in a day is twice the distance to his workplace.

The distance to work is given as 3 miles. Therefore, the total distance walked each day is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

Since Jeff works 5 days a week, we can multiply the daily distance by the number of days to find the total miles walked per week.

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a social network analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls, we need to understand the pattern of the sequence. In each round, the number of families notified is 3 times the number of families notified in the previous round.

Let's break it down:

- In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
- In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are notified.
- In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 other families, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are notified.
- In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 other families, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are notified.

To find the total number of families notified, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: 

Total = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 3, r = 3, and n = 4. 

Total = 3 * (3^4 - 1) / (3 - 1)
Total = 3 * (81 - 1) / 2
Total = 3 * 80 / 2
Total = 120

Therefore, the total number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a registered dietitian. I'd be happy to help you calculate Mark's initial weight.

To determine Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight he lost over the 3-month period. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, we can calculate his total weight loss as follows:

Weight lost = Weight lost per month * Number of months
Weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months
Weight lost = 30 pounds

Now, we can find Mark's initial weight by adding his final weight to his total weight loss:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and swim coach. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we can multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:

Time = 3 x 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:

Time = 2 x 16 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:

Time = 3 x 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the locker sizes. We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, and Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. We can represent this as an equation:

Zack's locker size = (1/2) × Timothy's locker size
Zack's locker size = (1/2) × 24
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. We can represent this as another equation:

"As a registered dietitian, I'd be happy to help you with this coffee conundrum.

To determine how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we need to calculate the difference between his current consumption and the recommended amount. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, and since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we can calculate Juan's current consumption as follows:

Current consumption = 10 * 0.5 = 5 cups

The doctor has asked Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find out how many cups Juan must reduce, we subtract 4 from his current consumption:

Reduction = 5 - 4 = 1 cup

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

The answer is: 1"

To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

Number of hamsters: 3 cages * 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters
Number of guinea pigs: 3 cages * 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Total number of rodents: 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

The pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to add their weights and divide by 3.

Mark's weight: 150 pounds
Susan's weight: 150 - 20 = 130 pounds
Bob's weight: 2 * 130 = 260 pounds

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"As an Egyptologist specializing in ancient architecture, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

The great pyramids of Sahir's house are indeed aligned with the cardinal directions, and the initial angle of 32 degrees from the ground is a result of the pyramid's construction. The sun's movement is a result of the Earth's rotation, which causes the sun to appear to rise and set at different angles.

Given that the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it will have moved after 10 hours. This can be represented as:

Angle moved = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
Angle moved = 50 degrees

To find the new angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the angle moved:

New angle = Initial angle + Angle moved
New angle = 32 degrees + 50 degrees
New angle = 82 degrees

Therefore, after 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of 82 degrees from the ground.

Final answer: 82"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the candles, we need to determine the number of candles James needs and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. However, we don't need to consider their ages to find the number of candles. We know James has two sons, so he needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Now, we know James needs 10 candles and each pack contains 5 candles. To find the total cost, we'll divide the total number of candles by 5 and multiply by the cost per pack.

Total cost = (10 / 5) * 3
Total cost = 2 * 3
Total cost = 6

The final answer is: $6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a reading specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, let's calculate the number of pages she read in the first week. Since she reads 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can find the total minutes she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes per night by the number of nights.

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total minutes into pages. We know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5.

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages

Now that we know she read 70 pages in the first week, we can add this to the 100 pages she read in the second week to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks.

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we need to calculate how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which is 1/3 of 12. We can calculate this as:

(1/3) × 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which is 1/4 of 12. We can calculate this as:

(1/4) × 12 = 12 ÷ 4 = 3

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:

12 - 7 = 5

There are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, and in 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew. We can represent Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

We know that S = 44. In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

So, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00. For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.

To find the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to calculate the amount for the last two teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and a math whiz. I'm excited to help you solve this soccer scoring problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna. We can represent the number of goals scored by Mark as 'M' and the number of goals scored by Anna as 'A'. Since Richie scored 80 goals, we can set up two equations:

1. Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

2. Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount Mitchell made and the amount Liam made. We know Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 apiece, so we can multiply the number of lemonades by the price to find his total.

Let's calculate Mitchell's total:

21 lemonades × $4/lemonade = $84

Now, we need to find the difference between Mitchell's total and Liam's total. We know Liam made $63, so we can subtract this from Mitchell's total:

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

The final answer is: $21"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Peter's spending plan to determine the total number of action figures he'll have by the end of the week.

First, we need to calculate how much Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday. Since he spent $5 each day for 3 days, the total amount spent is:

$5 * 3 = $15

Now, let's subtract this amount from his initial $70:

$70 - $15 = $55

This means Peter has $55 left for the rest of the week. Since he buys plastic action figures at $2 each, we can calculate the number of action figures he can buy:

$55 ÷ $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, we'll round down to 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have 3 wooden action figures and 27 plastic action figures.

The final answer is 30."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert with extensive experience in rose cultivation. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

First, we calculate the total number of roses needed per month:
Total roses per week: 20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop) = 65 roses/week
Total roses per month: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, we subtract the number of roses Ford grows per week from the total number of roses needed per month:
260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: 100"
"As a financial analyst, I'd be happy to help you calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account.

To determine the remaining balance after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount withdrawn from the account. Since Katina withdraws $100 every month, we can calculate the total amount withdrawn in 24 months (2 years):

Total amount withdrawn = $100 * 24
Total amount withdrawn = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining balance = Initial balance - Total amount withdrawn
Remaining balance = $3000 - $2400
Remaining balance = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food industry expert with a focus on food truck operations. I'd be happy to help you calculate the net profit of the grilled cheese food truck.

To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each. 

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Next, let's calculate the total cost. The cost of bread per loaf is $3.00, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. So, the food truck needs 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches.

Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in cooking and recipe development. I'd be happy to help you with Maggie's oven issue.

To determine the correct temperature, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 

To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 

4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a charity event organizer. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of utensils, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend. The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a contact lens expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts and then divide it by the total number of pairs.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off. To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of $100.00 and subtract it from the original price.

10% of $100.00 is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we need to first determine their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since she earns $10 per hour, her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. Since he also earns $10 per hour, his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a registered dietitian specializing in sports nutrition. I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink after her workout.

To determine the total calories burned, we need to calculate the calories burned from aerobics and running. 

Aerobics burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours, so the total calories burned from aerobics is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.
Running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, so the total calories burned from running is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.

Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this jelly bean conundrum.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, and we need to find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans.

We know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can express this as an equation:

R = 0.99B

We also know that the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can express this as:

G = 1.01B

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the three colors, which is given as 4500. We can write this as an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

Now, we can substitute the expressions for R and G into the total equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

G - R = 1.01B - 0.99B
G - R = 0.02B
G - R = 0.02(1500)
G - R = 30

To determine the total number of people, we need to consider the initial number of people invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Alex initially invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.

Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question about the cost of boots on Amazon and eBay.

To determine the total cost of the boots on eBay, we need to add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost. Since the shipping cost on eBay is twice as much as it is on Amazon, we can calculate it as follows:

Cost of boots on eBay = $13
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 * $4 = $8
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

Now, let's compare the total cost on eBay to the total cost on Amazon. The total cost on Amazon is $16 (cost of boots) + $4 (shipping cost) = $20.

To find the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay, we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay:

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate its height on each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

Let's start with the initial height of the beanstalk, which is 4 feet. Since it doubles its height every day, we can model its growth using an exponential function:

Height (h) = 4 * 2^(day - 1)

We want to find the day when the height exceeds 20 feet, so we set up the inequality:

4 * 2^(day - 1) > 20

To solve for day, we can divide both sides by 4:

2^(day - 1) > 5

Now, we can take the logarithm base 2 of both sides to isolate day:

day - 1 > log2(5)

Adding 1 to both sides gives us:

day > log2(5) + 1

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.32. Therefore:

day > 2.32 + 1
day > 3.32

Since day must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest integer value of day that satisfies the inequality is 4.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to first find the grams of protein he gets per day. Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can divide the total grams of mushrooms he eats per day by the grams of protein per cup to find the grams of protein per day.

Let's do the math:

200 grams of mushrooms ÷ 3 grams of protein per cup = 66.67 grams of protein per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week.

66.67 grams of protein per day × 7 days per week = 466.67 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 466.67"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We can represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dental hygienist with over 10 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you calculate how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work.

To determine the total cost of the dental work, we need to calculate the cost of the implants and the crown. The base price of the implants is $2000 each, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To find out how many hours George needs to work to pay for the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15).

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

The final answer is: 260"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geometry expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We're given that one angle is twice the smallest angle (2x) and the other angle is three times the smallest angle (3x). We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since we're asked to find the largest angle, we can see that it's 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. 

First, we'll calculate the value of each type of coin: 
- 8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2
- 6 dimes = 6 x $0.10 = $0.60
- 14 nickels = 14 x $0.05 = $0.70
- 15 pennies = 15 x $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fitness enthusiast and personal trainer. I'd be happy to help you with Jamaal's weightlifting situation.

To find the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question about Steve's game collection.

To calculate the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to break down his game purchases into three categories: birthday gifts, monthly purchases, and Christmas gifts.

Year 1:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 1 game/month x 12 months = 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 1: 17 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games

Year 2:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 1 game/month x 12 months = 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 2: 17 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games

Year 3:
- Birthday gifts: 5 games
- Monthly purchases: 2 games/month x 12 months = 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- Christmas gifts: 5 games
- Total games in Year 3: 29 (previous) + 5 (Christmas) = 34 games

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the total games from each year:
22 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 78 games

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in aviation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

We already know the rate of the plane is 400 miles per hour. Now, we can plug in the values:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a chocolatier with extensive experience in chocolate production. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to determine their individual production rates and then multiply those rates by the number of hours they worked.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his hourly production rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz in an hour. To find her hourly production rate, we multiply Ruiz's rate by 3/4: (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they made in 12 hours:

Ruiz's total production: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
Marissa's total production: 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"Let's break down Howard's spending over the three days.

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. This is a straightforward amount.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64.

To find the total amount spent, we add these amounts together: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find out how much he has left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is $12."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a tire expert with extensive experience in tire rotation and maintenance. I'd be happy to help you determine how long a tire will last.

To calculate the number of years a tire will last, we need to consider the total number of rotations it can undergo before needing replacement. We're given that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations. 

First, let's calculate the total number of rotations per year. We know that Jeremy drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles. So, the number of rotations per mile is 725/2 = 362.5 rotations per mile.

Now, let's find the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire will last for 6 years.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of each pump of shampoo.

To determine the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total number of washings Jackie will get from 1 pump. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washings.

Now, we need to find the cost of 60 washings. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. 

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per 60 washings = $24.00 / 2 = $12.00

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per 60 washings = $12.00 * 100 = 1200 cents

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the total cost by the number of pumps.

Cost per pump = 1200 cents / 60 = 20 cents

The final answer is: $20"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the outfit, we need to calculate the discount on the shirt first. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there's a 30% discount. 

Discount = 30% of $25
= 0.3 * $25
= $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

Now, let's calculate how much money Joe will have left after the purchase:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Unfortunately, Joe will be short of money by $6.70.

The final answer is: $-6.70"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry chef with extensive experience in baking croissants. When it comes to scaling up production, I always consider the key factors that affect the final product.

To determine the amount of butter needed, we need to calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then multiply it by the amount of butter required per dozen. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of butter needed.

Let's break it down:

Number of croissants per day = 4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 croissants
Total croissants for 7 days = 48 croissants/day * 7 days = 336 croissants

Now, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed:

Total butter needed = (1/4 pound / 12 croissants) * 336 croissants
= (1/48) * 336
= 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a civil engineer specializing in pavement design and construction. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we need to calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost per meter to repave a street is $194. Monica's street is 150 meters long, so the cost of repaving her street is:

Cost = Length x Cost per meter
= 150 meters x $194/meter
= $29,100

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so the cost of repaving his street is:

Cost = Length x Cost per meter
= 490 meters x $194/meter
= $94,660

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
= $94,660 - $29,100
= $65,560

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,560"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a research analyst with expertise in financial modeling and data analysis. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of John's research.

To calculate the total cost of the research, we need to break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months.

For the first 5 months, John received $100,000 per month. So, the total cost for the first 5 months is:

$100,000 x 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This means the funding for the 6th month is $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000, for the 7th month it's $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000, and so on.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 x 1.5 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of seats in the auditorium, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats in each row:

Total seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row
Total seats = 72 seats

Now, we need to find the number of seats occupied by administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so we calculate:

Seats occupied by administrators = Total seats * 1/4
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4
Seats occupied by administrators = 18 seats

The remaining seats are:
Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators
Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats
Remaining seats = 54 seats

Next, we need to find the number of seats occupied by parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents, so we calculate:

Seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats * 1/3
Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3
Seats occupied by parents = 18 seats

The remaining seats are occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents
Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a network engineer with expertise in internet connectivity and speed conversions. I'd be happy to help you with Ashley's internet connection speed.

To convert Ashley's speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we need to perform a few steps.

First, we'll convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000, since 1 Mb = 1000 kb.

Speed in Mb/s = 20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we'll multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour (3600 seconds). There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.

Speed in Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s × 60 s/min × 60 min/h = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/h

Now, let's calculate the result:

Speed in Mb/h = 0.02 × 60 × 60 = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: 72"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on tow truck operations. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of cars towed by a tow truck in a week.

To determine the total number of cars towed, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days separately.

On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the first three days is:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining days (4 days), the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. So, the total number of cars towed on the remaining days is:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide by his annual growth rate.

First, let's convert the required height to inches: 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches.

Now, subtract Adam's current height from the required height: 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Next, divide the difference by his annual growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating profits and commissions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find James' total profit, we need to calculate the profit per car and then multiply it by the number of cars sold.

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, which means they paid $7,500 per car. The selling price is $25,000, so the profit per car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

Now, James gets a 10% commission on the profits. To calculate the commission, we multiply the total profit by 0.1: $175,000 * 0.1 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist specializing in wave dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of surfers who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet, we need to calculate 25% of the total number of riders. This is equivalent to 0.25 * 100 = 25 surfers.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which gives us 0.6 * 25 = 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10 men.

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a jewelry expert with extensive knowledge of precious metals and gemstones. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total price of all three jewels, we need to first determine the prices of gold and silver jewels. We're given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, so we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can find the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to determine the number of each type of stamp and add them together.

We know Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

Now, let's add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in traffic flow and speed calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we should consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

To calculate the time, we can divide the distance by the relative speed.

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Naomi caught 17 fish, and we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.

To solve this, we can start by finding out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, we can subtract 6 from Naomi's total:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now that we know Darren caught 11 fish, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to Darren's total:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum number of classes he can attend while staying within the budget of $60. Since his parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

Total Cost = Number of Classes x Cost per Class
60 = Number of Classes x 10

To find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

Number of Classes = 60 ÷ 10
Number of Classes = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many he can miss before exceeding the budget. To do this, we subtract the number of classes he can attend from the total number of classes:

Number of Classes he can miss = Total Number of Classes - Number of Classes he can attend
= 10 - 6
= 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"As a retail operations expert, I can help you calculate the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel.

To find the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and a math whiz. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up an equation to find Lynn's distance:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To solve for Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a civil engineer with expertise in excavation and construction. Let's calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole.

To find the volume of the hole, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of Bill's new truck.

To find the total cost, we need to add up the base price of the truck and the costs of the additional features. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
3. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
4. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add them together.

Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance she biked, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time. So, the distance Alisa biked is:

Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
= 12 × 4.5
= 54 miles

Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula, the distance he biked is:

Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
= 10 × 2.5
= 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances together:
54 miles (Alisa) + 25 miles (Stanley) = 79 miles

The total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a social media analytics expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of likes, we need to break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the initial number of likes. Fishio received 2000 likes after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 

Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

70x = 2000 + 20000

Now, let's solve for x:

70x - 20000 = 2000
70x = 22000
x = 22000 / 70
x = 314.29

Since we can't have a fraction of a like, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the decimal for the sake of precision.

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes.

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 314.29 + 20000
Total likes = 20114.29

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the sales from green hats, we can multiply the sales from red hats by 2.

Sales from green hats in the first month = 2 x $400 = $800

The total sales in the first month were $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we can multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4.

Sales in the second month = (3/4) x $1200 = $900

The total sales in two months were $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we need to calculate the difference between her expected wage and the current bank account balance.

Expected wage: $300
Current bank account balance: $420

Since Sally's bank account balance is higher than her expected wage, it means that she has a surplus. To find out how much was withheld, we need to subtract the current bank account balance from the expected wage.

$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank account balance) = -$120

This result indicates that Sally has a surplus of $120. However, the question asks how much was withheld from her wage. Since the result is negative, it means that $120 was not withheld from her wage. Instead, she has a surplus.

To find the amount withheld, we can subtract the current bank account balance from the expected wage, but in this case, it's not applicable. The correct approach is to find the difference between the expected wage and the current bank account balance.

$300 (expected wage) - $420 (current bank account balance) = -$120

Since the result is negative, we can conclude that Sally has a surplus of $120. However, the question asks how much was withheld from her wage. The correct interpretation is that she didn't have $120 withheld from her wage; instead, she has a surplus.

The correct answer is: $0 (or $120 surplus)"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in event planning and food preparation. I'd be happy to help you determine the number of eggs Lori needs for her party.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a focus on cooking techniques and kitchen efficiency. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total cooking time for Finley's groceries, we need to break down the cooking times for each ingredient. We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook the pork, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. The cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm animal expert. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20. We can use this information to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We can write the equation:

4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:

s + g = 20

Now, we can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:

g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:

4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a coffee connoisseur and cost analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost of the coffee and the donut separately. 

First, we need to find the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 pounds. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, but the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. 

7 pounds of the more expensive brand will cost 7 x $6 = $42.

Now, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

The total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

The final answer is: $44"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. Let's break down Gus's grocery expenses to determine the cost of the apple pie.

To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent. 

First, calculate the total cost of the chips: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Next, calculate the total cost of the chicken and soda: $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00
Now, add the cost of the chips and the chicken and soda: $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00

To find the cost of the apple pie, subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent: $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a passion for teaching cooking techniques. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the number of recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can find the total number of hours per week by multiplying the number of times the class meets and the duration of each class:

4 * 2 = 8 hours per week

Since the class meets for 6 weeks, we can multiply the number of hours per week by the number of weeks:

8 * 6 = 48 hours

Now, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we can divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

48 ÷ 1.5 = 32

Therefore, John learns 32 new recipes during the 6-week cooking class.

The final answer is 32."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Now, we're told that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

To find the total amount of money they have together, we add their individual amounts:

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
= 120 + 90 + 150
= 360

Since they want to share the money equally among themselves, we divide the total amount by 3:

Shared amount per person = Total amount / 3
= 360 / 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"As a sports enthusiast and basketball fan, I can break down the game duration into its components. Since each quarter is 12 minutes long, we can calculate the total time for the four regular quarters as follows:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a data analyst with expertise in statistical analysis and data interpretation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Christina records her mood every day on a calendar for 30 days. We're given the following information:

- The first 8 days were good.
- The second 8 days were bad.
- The third 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

We need to find the number of good days left in the month.

To do this, we can start by finding the total number of good days. We know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days is:

Total good days = 8 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 11

Now, we can subtract the total number of good days from the total number of days to find the number of bad and neutral days:

Bad and neutral days = Total days - Total good days
Bad and neutral days = 30 - 11
Bad and neutral days = 19

Since we know that the first 8 days were bad, we can find the number of neutral days by subtracting the bad days from the total bad and neutral days:

Neutral days = Bad and neutral days - 8
Neutral days = 19 - 8
Neutral days = 11

Now, we can find the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the total number of good days from the total number of days:

Good days left = Total days - Total good days
Good days left = 30 - 11
Good days left = 19

The final answer is 19."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you solve the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. We can represent this as an equation: 2x + 3 = 21, where x is the number of books Sally has.

To solve for x, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in bamboo species. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we need to first convert the target height from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate this as follows:

600 inches (target height) - 20 feet (current height) = 600 inches - (20 x 12 inches/foot) = 600 - 240 inches = 360 inches

Now, we know the bamboo needs to grow 360 inches. Given that it grows 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required as follows:

Number of days = Total inches to grow / Growth rate per day
= 360 inches / 30 inches/day
= 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dog behaviorist and animal welfare expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the total number of toys James needs for the doggie shelter.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs one toy. This is a straightforward calculation, as it's a simple ratio of dogs to toys.
2. With 8 more dogs in the shelter, the total number of dogs becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.
3. However, when James returned, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.
4. Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we can simply add the initial number of toys he had to the number of additional toys he needs to buy: 9 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 14 toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 14 toys for the doggie shelter.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a total investment of $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of this amount. To find out how much Dylan invested, we multiply 1200 by 2/5.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in preparing hash browns. When it comes to scaling up recipes, it's essential to maintain the same ratio of ingredients to achieve the desired outcome.

To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we can use a simple proportion. Since 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can set up a ratio:

6 potatoes : 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can multiply the number of hash browns per potato (6) by the total number of potatoes (96) and divide by 6:

Hash browns = (6 potatoes * 96 potatoes) / 6
Hash browns = 96

Answer: 96"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a structural engineer specializing in elevator systems. When it comes to determining the maximum load capacity of an elevator, we need to consider the weight of the people and any additional factors such as cargo or equipment.

In this scenario, we're given that the elevator's maximum load is 700 kg and there are 9 adults weighing an average of 80 kg each. To find the total weight of the 9 adults, we can multiply the weight of one adult by 9.

Total weight = 9 x 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, we need to subtract this from the total weight to find the excess weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

Therefore, the 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The answer is: 20"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's cookies. To find Max's cookies, we can add 5 to Katarina's cookies:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Next, we're told that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, to find the Cookie Monster's cookies, we subtract 12 from Max's cookies:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Lastly, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's cookies, we add 23 to Max's cookies:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion designer with expertise in garment construction and measurement. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the process of the 50% extension and the addition of 20cm. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the final length of the dress is 140cm. We need to subtract the 20cm lace trim to find the length after the extension, but before the trim was added. 

Let's denote the length after the extension as x. We know that x + 20 = 140. 

Subtract 20 from both sides:

x = 140 - 20
x = 120

Now, we need to find the original length before the 50% extension. Let's denote the original length as y. We know that y + 0.5y = 120.

Combine like terms:

1.5y = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

y = 120 / 1.5
y = 80

The original length of the dress was 80cm.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the information given:

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets, with one twin being 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

To solve this, let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a year, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the twin's age, as age is typically measured in whole years.

To find the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month. 
Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Total coins Rong saves in a year = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Total coins Neil saves in a year = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

Now, let's subtract these two amounts from her original paycheck to find out how much she has left: $2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720.

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to first find the total number of pencils in the box. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: 8"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard:
120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food and beverage expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of drinks and snacks. There are 19 people in total, and each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

The total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a logistics expert with extensive experience in trucking and cargo management. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Now, let's find out how much gravel the three trucks can carry together. We're given that the total capacity is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity.

The combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy's trucks is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. Subtracting this from the total capacity, we get:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2,800}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a focus on Asian cuisine. Today, I'm happy to help you with the dumpling conundrum.

To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to consider the eating habits of both males and females. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and each male ate 1 more than each female, we can calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by each group.

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as 'f' and the number eaten by each male as 'm'. We know that m = f + 1. We also know that there are 6 females and 8 males.

The total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6f, and the total number eaten by males is 8m. Since m = f + 1, we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of dumplings eaten by males: 8(f + 1).

We're given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so f = 3. Now we can calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by females: 6f = 6(3) = 18.

Substituting f = 3 into the equation for the total number of dumplings eaten by males, we get 8(f + 1) = 8(3 + 1) = 8(4) = 32.

The total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is 18 + 32 = 50.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is indeed 50.

Final answer: 50"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that for every 3 parts Gerald gets, Julia gets 2 parts. To find out how much Gerald had initially, we need to find the total parts in the ratio, which is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald's share is 3 parts, we can calculate his initial amount by multiplying the total amount ($100) by the fraction representing his share (3/5).

Gerald's initial amount = (3/5) * 100
= 3 * 20
= 60

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount:

Gerald's remaining amount = 60 - 10
= 50

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in animal behavior and physiology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to calculate its speed first. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. To find the turtle's speed, we'll divide this value by 5:

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second ÷ 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a hydrologist specializing in water resource management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. 

The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 

So, the percentage of water used for industrial purposes is 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a production management specialist with expertise in optimizing manufacturing processes. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the hourly production rates for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its hourly rate is 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its hourly rate is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry chef and owner of a local bakery. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total bill for Marcus' order.

To calculate the total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we'll multiply the total cost by 0.10: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Finally, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The total bill for Marcus is $45.00."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your ice cream conundrum.

Let's break it down step by step. The ice cream parlor is offering a deal where you buy 2 scoops of ice cream and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. To find out how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to calculate the total cost of the scoops she can afford.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 2x + 0.5x = 6, where x is the number of scoops Erin buys at the regular price. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2.5x = 6. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 6 ÷ 2.5
x = 2.4

Since Erin can't buy a fraction of a scoop, we round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, she can afford 2 scoops at the regular price. However, considering the deal, she can get 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys. So, she can actually get 3 scoops for the price of 2.

Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

Final answer: 3"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much candy each person has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a professional interior designer specializing in bathroom remodeling. When it comes to tile selection, I always consider the square footage of the space and the number of tiles required per square foot.

To determine the number of tiles needed to cover two-thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, I'll calculate two-thirds of 36. 

Two-thirds of 36 is (2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet.

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, I'll multiply 24 by 24.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cost analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate James' savings, we need to find the cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries is the initial cost of $20 plus the cost per pound, which is $1.5. Since James picked 30 pounds, the total cost of picking is:

$20 + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying blueberries at the store. The cost per pound is $2.5, and James picked 30 pounds, so the total cost of buying is:

$2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:

$75 - $65 = $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount of money the company paid for the computers.

To calculate the total amount, we need to find the new price of each computer after the 10% increase. 

The original price of each computer was $700. To find 10% of $700, we multiply $700 by 0.1.

10% of $700 = 0.1 * $700 = $70

New price of each computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers.

Total amount = $770 * 500

To avoid any calculation errors, I'll use the multiplication symbol (×) to represent the operation.

Total amount = $770 × 500

Total amount = $385,000

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dance expert with a focus on clog dancing. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total number of taps Helga makes during her 5-minute dance, we need to consider the two scenarios: when her arms are at her sides and when they're raised.

When her arms are at her sides, Helga taps her feet at a combined rate of 550 taps per minute. Since she dances for 3 minutes in this position, the total number of taps is:

3 minutes * 550 taps/minute = 1650 taps

When her arms are raised, her tap rate decreases to 400 taps per minute. She dances in this position for 2 minutes, so the total number of taps is:

2 minutes * 400 taps/minute = 800 taps

To find the total number of taps, we add the taps from both scenarios:

Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps

"As a civil engineer, I can help you calculate the cost-effectiveness of Ron's decision to fix the pothole himself.

To determine the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of materials and the potential damage to Ron's car. The cost of materials includes the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is $25 per bucket. Therefore, the total cost of materials is 3 x $25 = $75.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the cost of materials and the fine imposed by the city council, which is $120. So, the total cost is $75 (materials) + $120 (fine) = $195.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is the potential damage to Ron's car, which is $450.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $195 (total cost of fixing the pothole) - $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) = -$255. However, since we are looking for the amount saved, we consider the absolute value, which is $255.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 5 pizzas in total, and each pizza has 12 slices. To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for this group, they ate 2/3 * 2 = 4/3 pizzas. To convert this to slices, we multiply by 12: 4/3 * 12 = 16 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since there are 2 pizzas for this group, they ate ¾ * 2 = 1 ½ pizzas. To convert this to slices, we multiply by 12: 1 ½ * 12 = 18 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by both groups: 16 + 18 = 34 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 34 = 26 slices.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, which is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's call the length of one of Bobby's shoes 'x'. We can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100.

To solve for x, we'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 9x = 100 - 10, which simplifies to 9x = 90.

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 9: x = 90 / 9, which simplifies to x = 10.

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we need to break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) × 5000 = 2000

Now, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. We subtract the number of people who voted from the total number of people:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we're told that 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00. To find the number of people who voted in the second half of the day, we multiply the remaining people by 2/3:

(2/3) × 3000 = 2000

Now, we need to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. We subtract the number of people who voted in the second half of the day from the remaining people:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry chef specializing in campfire treats. I'd be happy to help you determine how many boxes of graham crackers you'll need for your gathering.

To calculate the total number of smores needed, let's break it down:

You have 9 kids who want 2 smores each, and 6 adults who want 1 s'more each. So, the total number of smores needed is:

9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, you'll need:

3 sleeves/box = 3 boxes of graham crackers

- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a student council advisor. I'd be happy to help you with the student council election problem.

To find the number of votes candidate C got, we need to calculate the total number of votes first. We know that candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes. 

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes, so candidate B got 20 + (50% of 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.

The total number of votes is 100. So, candidate C got 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Beck has now, we add 10 to his initial amount: 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is: 3"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Clara has 20 books, which is twice the number of books Steven has. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide Clara's total by 2.

Steven's books = Clara's books / 2
Steven's books = 20 / 2
Steven's books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can add 6 to Steven's total to find Alice's total.

Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6
Alice's books = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we can subtract Alice's total from Clara's total.

Clara's books - Alice's books = 20 - 16
Clara's books - Alice's books = 4

The final answer is 4."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 50 students in total. We're given that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. To find the number of students who like to play video games or music, we can subtract the number of students who like to bake and play basketball from the total number of students.

50 (total students) - 10 (bake) - 5 (basketball) = 35

This means 35 students like to play video games or music. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can set up an equation:

Number of students who like music = 2 * Number of students who like basketball
= 2 * 5
= 10

Now, we know that 10 students like music, so we can find the number of students who like video games by subtracting the number of students who like music from the total number of students who like video games or music:

Number of students who like video games = 35 - 10
= 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of boys in each class, we need to first determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we can divide 80 by 2 to get the number of students in each class.

80 ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class

Next, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

40 × 0.4 = 16 girls in each class

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a card collector and enthusiast. I'm excited to help you calculate the profit Mark made from buying and selling magic cards.

To find the total cost of the packs, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total Cost = Number of Packs * Cost per Pack
Total Cost = 3 packs * $1800 per pack
Total Cost = $5400

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. We have two cards worth $4000 and $1000, and 30 cards worth $50 each. To find the total value, we add these amounts together:

Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50)
Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + $1500
Total Value = $6500

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value:

Profit = Total Value - Total Cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
= $50 * 7
= $350

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 per week."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles, and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 × 56
Carl's marbles = 224

We also know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, to find out how many marbles Cal has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 × 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, let's find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined.

Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 224 + 112
Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles = 336

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of groups needed, we need to divide the total number of students (54) by the number of groups required (6). However, the question seems to be asking for the number of groups needed to form 12 groups, which is a bit confusing.

Assuming the activity requires 6 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

54 ÷ 6 = 9 students per group

Since the question asks for the number of groups needed to form 12 groups, we can calculate the total number of groups required as follows:

Total students ÷ students per group = Total groups
54 ÷ 9 = 6

To form 12 groups, we need to divide the total number of students by the desired number of students per group:

Total students ÷ desired students per group = Total groups
54 ÷ 9 = 6 (to form 6 groups)
54 ÷ 9 = 6

To form 12 groups, we need:

54 ÷ 4.5 = 12

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can form 12 groups with 54 students.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a business analyst specializing in operational planning and forecasting. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20. Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8. Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Now, let's add the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends to find the overall total. Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sticker and button expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a council analyst with expertise in voting system dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. If we denote the number of votes against the regulation as x, then the number of votes in favor is 2x.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. To find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we need to break down the information given.

First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. This can be calculated as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we need to find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, 60% of these remaining people think horse #7 will win, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

Now, to find the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. This gives us 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 people.

Therefore, 16 people think horse #12 will win."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a puppy expert and breeder. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls. We're given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. 

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up an equation: 

(1/3) * Total Pomeranians = 6

To solve for Total Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now that we know there are 18 Pomeranians, we can find the total number of puppies. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:

(2/3) * Total Puppies = 18

To solve for Total Puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * (3/2)
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and time management expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we need to first determine the total time she has available for soccer. We know she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours.

Next, we need to subtract the time she spends reading (3 hours) and playing video games (1/3 of the remaining time). The remaining time is 12 - 3 = 9 hours. Since she spends 1/3 of this time playing video games, we calculate 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50\%}$"

2. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is 1/2 * 50 = 25 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 50 - 25 = 25 pencils
3. He then gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie, which is 3/5 * 25 = 15 pencils.
   Remaining pencils: 25 - 15 = 10 pencils

Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: 10"
"As a travel expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total time Jack is gone from home.

To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to consider the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum. 

First, let's calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack's speed is 75 miles per hour. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time it takes to drive to the museum. So, the total time to drive to and from the museum is 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

Next, we add the time spent at the museum, which is 6 hours. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

Total time = Time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mechanical engineer with expertise in designing and optimizing systems. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of wheels left in the box after Henry assembles the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

The number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
The number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

The total number of wheels required is 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

Therefore, the number of wheels left in the box is 276.

Final Answer: The final answer is $800."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a film enthusiast and expert in movie collection management. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of replacing your movie collection with digital versions.

To determine the total cost, we need to break down the process into steps.

First, let's calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

The cost of the normal movies is $10 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the normal movies:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot.

To find the distance, we need to first determine the time they spent driving. We know they drove for 6 hours in total and spent 1.5 hours hiking. So, the time they spent driving is:

Time driving = Total time - Time hiking
Time driving = 6 - 1.5
Time driving = 4.5 hours

Now, we know their driving speed (50 miles per hour) and the time they spent driving (4.5 hours). We can use the formula:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 * 4.5
Distance = 225 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 225 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break down the scoring system for the video game. We know that Ava and Emma receive points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level on time.

For every enemy they jump on, they receive 10 points. Since Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, we can represent Emma's enemy points as 0 (since she jumps on 0 enemies) and Ava's enemy points as 8 * 10 = 80.

For every berry they collect, they receive 5 points. Since Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, we can represent Emma's berry points as 3 * 5 = 15 and Ava's berry points as 0 * 5 = 0.

For every second left on the timer when they finish the level, they receive 30 points. Since Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, we can represent Emma's time points as 30 * 30 = 900 and Ava's time points as 26 * 30 = 780.

Now, let's calculate their total scores:

Emma's score: 0 (enemy points) + 15 (berry points) + 900 (time points) = 915

Ava's score: 80 (enemy points) + 0 (berry points) + 780 (time points) = 860

The difference between their scores is 915 - 860 = 55.

The final answer is 55."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that four pizzas were ordered for a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost.

Total cost of the four pizzas = 64 dollars
Cost of two pizzas = 2 x 30 dollars = 60 dollars
Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost - Cost of two pizzas
Cost of the other two pizzas = 64 - 60
Cost of the other two pizzas = 4 dollars

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we can divide the remaining cost by 2:
Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 4 / 2
Cost of each of the other two pizzas = 2 dollars

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to calculate the number of times they ride on the usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15.

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so we multiply 3 (the usual number of times) by 2 (the multiplier) and then by 2 (the number of extra days), which gives us 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond. He then took out 17 fish from a mixed tank at the pet store. Since we don't know the exact composition of the mixed tank, let's assume the 17 fish taken out are a mix of orange and white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish taken out as x. Then, the number of orange fish taken out would be 17 - x.

After taking out the fish, Bob has 3 - (17 - x) orange fish and 4 - x white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

3 - (17 - x) = 2(4 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 - 17 + x = 8 - 2x

Combine like terms:

-14 + x = 8 - 2x

Add 2x to both sides:

-14 + 3x = 8

Add 14 to both sides:

3x = 22

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 22/3

x = 7.33 (round down to 7, since we can't take out a fraction of a fish)

So, Bob took out 7 white fish from the mixed tank.

Now, let's calculate the number of white fish Bob has now:

4 - 7 = -3

Since we can't have a negative number of fish, this means our initial assumption about the composition of the mixed tank was incorrect. However, we can still calculate the number of white fish Bob has now:

Bob has 1 white fish (from the initial 4 white fish) and 7 white fish (from the mixed tank).

The final answer is: 7"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fuel efficiency expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to consider the total distance he travels and his car's fuel efficiency.

First, we need to calculate the total distance Andy travels in a week. Since he commutes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. The one-way distance is 5 miles, so the round-trip distance is 5 * 2 = 10 miles per day.

Total distance traveled in a week = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Next, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance traveled / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of gas consumed per week:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount Carrie paid for lunch.

To find the total amount Carrie paid, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters and the amount she spent on the twenties.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. 3/5 of 10 is (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, she spent 6 * 20 = $120 on twenties.

She also spent all 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, she spent 140 * 0.25 = $35 on quarters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent: $120 (twenties) + $35 (quarters) = $155.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a human resources specialist with expertise in workforce management and compensation analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to consider the initial number of employees, the number of new employees hired per month, and the salary per employee.

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees every month. To find the total number of employees after three months, we can use the following calculation:

Total employees after 3 months = Initial employees + (New employees per month * Number of months)
= 200 + (20 * 3)
= 200 + 60
= 260

Now, let's calculate the total salary paid to employees after three months. The salary per employee is $4000, so we can multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid after 3 months = Total employees after 3 months * Salary per employee
= 260 * $4000
= $1,040,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating salary differences. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Billy's hourly wage after the two raises. Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a passionate environmentalist and reforestation expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of trees planted in the campaign.

To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately. 

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by students. There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. So, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

Now, let's add the total number of trees planted by students and teachers to get the overall total. The total number of trees planted is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and then determine the percentage of stuffed goats she needs to achieve.

First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.2x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.2x from both sides gives:

0.8x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.8 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.8
x = 0.25

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 1 stuffed goat to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gaming enthusiast and achievement hunter. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many hours Kris needs to play to earn her video game achievement.

To calculate the total hours Kris has played, we need to break down her gaming sessions into two parts. 

First, let's calculate the hours she played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) every day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily playtime: 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours she played in the last week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and she plays for 2 hours every day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily playtime: 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both periods: 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, we subtract 21 from 30 to find out how many more hours she needs to play: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: 9"
"As a transportation engineer, I can provide a straightforward solution to this problem.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in 2 hours. 

The first car is traveling at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The second car is traveling at a constant speed of 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours, it will travel 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

Since the second car passed the first car, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car to find the distance between them.

Distance between the two cars = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

$900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math specialist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the school's overall pass rate.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mosaic artist and expert in glasswork. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the length of Milo's mosaic, we need to calculate the total area of the mosaic and then find the length. Since it takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, and each bag contains 72 chips, we can start by finding the total number of chips available.

Number of bags: 2
Number of chips per bag: 72
Total number of chips: 2 * 72 = 144

Now, we can find the total area of the mosaic by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Total area = Total number of chips / Number of chips per square inch
Total area = 144 / 12
Total area = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Length = Total area / Height
Length = 12 / 3
Length = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a tea connoisseur and quantity expert. I'd be happy to help you with your tea-related query.

To determine the initial amount of tea, let's break down the information provided. We know that 4 students drank 1.5 quarts each, and 16 students drank 2 quarts each. 

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the first group: 4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts.
Next, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the second group: 16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts.

Now, add the amounts consumed by both groups: 6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). So, 48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

Dale is selling butterscotch candies to raise money for his school club. He initially ordered 100 candies but ended up selling 150. Then, he ordered 100 more. To determine how many candies he still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Dale initially ordered 100 candies and sold 150, so he has 100 - 150 = -50 candies left. However, this is not possible since he can't have a negative number of candies. This means he actually sold more candies than he had. To find the correct number of candies he has, we need to consider the candies he had initially and the candies he ordered later.

2. Since Dale initially ordered 100 candies and sold 150, he didn't have enough candies to meet the demand. To find the correct number of candies he has, we need to consider the candies he had initially and the candies he ordered later. Let's assume he had x candies initially. Then, he ordered 100 more candies. We know that the total number of candies he has is the sum of the candies he had initially and the candies he ordered later.

Let's represent the total number of candies he has as x + 100. We know that he sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he has left is (x + 100) - 150.

Since we can't have a negative number of candies, we can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

x + 100 - 150 ≤ 0

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

x - 50 ≤ 0

x ≤ 50

This means that the maximum number of candies Dale had initially is 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of candies he has:

Total candies = x + 100
= 50 + 100
= 150

Since he sold 150 candies, he still needs to sell:

150 - 150 = 0

However, this is not possible since he can't sell a negative number of candies. This means he actually sold all the candies he had, and he doesn't need to sell any more.

The correct answer is: 0"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a student counselor at the university. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we need to calculate the total number of students at the end of May and subtract the initial number of students.

Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can use the formula:

Total students at the end of May = 10 * 2^5

= 10 * 32

= 320

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

Additional students = Total students at the end of May - Initial students
= 320 - 10
= 310

Therefore, 310 additional students would have joined the campus by the end of May.

The final answer is: 310"
"As a tree climber and arborist, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a floristry expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of petals in the vase.

To find the total number of petals, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose picked and subtract the number of petals she dropped.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose picked:
3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Now, let's subtract the number of petals she dropped (1 of each type): 
- 1 flower with 5 petals: 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the total petals dropped from the total petals picked: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many S'mores John and DeSean can make, we need to subtract the number of marshmallows they dropped from the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

However, they both made 9 S'mores each, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 18 / 2 = 9

So, John and DeSean can each have 9 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have four individuals playing a game: Jack and two friends. The game duration and cost per quarter are given as follows:

- Jack's game duration: 20 minutes per quarter
- Friend 1's game duration: half of Jack's, which is 10 minutes per quarter
- Friend 2's game duration: also 10 minutes per quarter
- Friend 3's game duration: 1.5 times Jack's, which is 30 minutes per quarter

The total game duration is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. We can calculate the number of quarters each person played:

- Jack: 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Friend 1: 120 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Friend 2: 120 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
- Friend 3: 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used: 12 + 12 + 12 + 8 = 44 quarters

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 44 * $0.25 = $11.

The final answer is: $11"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a skilled mixologist and expert in crafting artisanal salt scrubs. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the amount of oil used in Tanya's salt scrub recipe, let's break down the information provided. We know that the total volume of the mixture is 10 ounces, and the amounts of salt, citrus zest, and fragrance are equal. Let's denote the amount of salt, citrus zest, and fragrance as x ounces.

Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces. We can set up an equation to represent the total volume of the mixture:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil in her salt scrub recipe.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on vehicle ownership and management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away, let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. So, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how much each student raised, we need to subtract the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised by the charity.

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised.

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students / Number of students
= $125,000 / 20
= $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to first find the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, we can calculate it as follows:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

Therefore, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{720}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this Magic Card collection problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of cards is 341, and we need to find out how many cards Becca has. We can start by using variables to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we need to calculate the number of extra items:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is:
- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Eva has saved $20. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Now, we're told that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 x $30
= $12

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
= $30 + $12
= $42

Therefore, Roy has $42.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mountain climber and geologist. I've spent years studying the art of mountain lifting and have a deep understanding of the relationships between different climbers' abilities.

To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to analyze the given information step by step:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in animal behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles. Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can calculate the time it will take for them to travel across the highway by using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know that 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours. Let's find the speed of one kangaroo:

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle:

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway:

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this clay dish problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, we can calculate Rory's dishes as follows:

Rory's dishes = Kora's dishes + 20
Rory's dishes = 20 + 20
Rory's dishes = 40

Now, we know Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. So, we can calculate Jada's dishes as follows:

Jada's dishes = 2 * Rory's dishes
Jada's dishes = 2 * 40
Jada's dishes = 80

To find the total number of clay dishes they all made together, we add up the number of dishes each one made:

Total dishes = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total dishes = 20 + 40 + 80
Total dishes = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with Erika's situation.

To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information provided:

1. The original price of the laptop is $600.
2. Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job.
4. Her mom agreed to give her $80 to help.

We can represent the total amount Erika has as the sum of these three amounts: x = 150 + 80 + (the amount she has in her purse).

Since Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, we can set up the equation:

x + 50 = 400

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of apple slices, we need to calculate the number of slices from the large apples and the small apples separately.

First, we calculate the number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 slices.

Next, we calculate the number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 slices.

Now, we add the number of slices from both types of apples: 15 (from large apples) + 15 (from small apples) = 30 slices.

Since Adam eats 15 slices, we subtract this from the total number of slices: 30 - 15 = 15.

Therefore, there are 15 apple slices left.

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dairy expert with extensive experience in cattle management. To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use a simple calculation.

First, we need to find out how much milk one cow produces per day. Since the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow, and he has 3 cows, the total milk production is 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.

To find out how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can divide 25 liters by 15 liters (the current total milk production). This gives us 25 / 15 = 1.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a cow, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Gabriel's situation to determine how much he still needs to buy the car and the phone.

To calculate the total amount Gabriel needs, we'll add the costs of the items: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends and received $200 from his brother, making a total of $5,200.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and has twice as many dishes as socks. To find the number of socks Jack has, we can divide the number of dishes by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2:

30 × 2 = 60 socks

Now, let's find the total number of socks they have together:

60 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 120 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. To find the number of socks Jack has, we can divide the number of dishes by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can multiply the number of dishes Jack has by 1/2:

60 × 1/2 = 30 dishes

Now, let's find the total number of dishes they have together:

60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

Finally, let's find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

120 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 210

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 210."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and student. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that there are 20 students in total, and we need to find out how many are good at math. We're given that 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only. To find the number of students good at both math and English, we can subtract the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm excited to help you with the problem.

To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Each group takes 10 minutes to perform (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage). We also need to consider a 10-minute intermission.

Total available time for performances = Total concert time - Intermission time
= 120 minutes - 10 minutes
= 110 minutes

Now, we can calculate the number of groups that can perform:

Number of groups = Total available time for performances / Time taken by each group
= 110 minutes / 10 minutes
= 11

So, Vicki can accommodate 11 groups in the concert.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion merchandising expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of white shirts with no collars, we need to calculate half of the total number of white shirts. This can be represented as:

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we know that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"As a farm management specialist, I can help you calculate the farmer's earnings.

To determine the total number of trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Total eggs = 900
Eggs per tray = 30

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"As a farm management expert, I can help you calculate the total number of goats left in both farms.

Let's break down the information:

Farm X initially had 55 goats and 10 were sold. To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

55 - 10 = 45

Farm Y initially had 45 goats and twice as many were sold (2 x 10 = 20). To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

45 - 20 = 25

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a urban planning specialist with expertise in residential development. I'd be happy to help you with the question.

To determine the total number of homes the town will have built over the next three years, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and add them together.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

"I'd be happy to help you solve the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Since you are 3 years younger than your brother, your brother's age is x + 3. You are 2 years older than your sister, so your sister's age is x - 2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, which is 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).

27 ÷ 8 = 3.375

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. 

To do this, we can use the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can use the ceiling function to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3.375.

The ceiling of 3.375 is 4.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 4 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a hydrologist specializing in river flow analysis. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we need to consider the doubling of the water flow on the second day. 

The initial amount of water passing through the river on the first day is 4000 gallons. On the second day, the water flow doubles, resulting in 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the water flow increases by 6000 gallons, so we add this amount to the second-day flow: 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: 14000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mathematician specializing in population dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the number of people infected after three days, we can use the concept of exponential growth. The initial number of infected people is 10, and each infected person infects 6 others, resulting in a growth rate of 6.

The formula for exponential growth is: N(t) = N0 * (r^t), where N0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time period.

In this case, N0 = 10, r = 6, and t = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (6^3)
= 10 * 216
= 2160

However, this calculation assumes that each infected person infects only 6 others, and there is no limit to the number of people that can be infected. In reality, there may be a limit to the number of people that can be infected, which would affect the growth rate.

To account for this, we can use the concept of a carrying capacity, which is the maximum number of people that can be infected. Let's assume the carrying capacity is 1000.

The formula for exponential growth with a carrying capacity is: N(t) = N0 * (r^t) / (1 - (1 - r)^t)

Plugging in the values, we get:

N(3) = 10 * (6^3) / (1 - (1 - 6)^3)
= 10 * 216 / (1 - (-5/7)^3)
= 2160 / (1 - (-125/343))
= 2160 / (1 + 125/343)
= 2160 / (369/343)
= 2160 * 343 / 369
= 2160 * 343 / 369
= 2160 * 343 / 369
= 2160 * 343 / 369
= 743.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number.

The final answer is: 743"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 1 * 12 = 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns: 36 - 6 = 30.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this coin problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. We also know that they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

Now, let's find the total number of red, green, and blue cars: 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from 75: 75 - 52 = 23.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this book-related puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books. We can represent the number of books each person has with variables.

Let's say Fawn has x books. Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books. Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 books.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of books:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a party planning expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the cost of jello for your son's outdoor birthday party.

To determine the total cost of jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the price per box. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cups needed. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will get 4 jello cups, we can multiply the number of kids by the number of cups per kid:

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we need to divide the total cups needed by 10 to find out how many boxes are required:

Total cups needed: 120
Cups per box: 10

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we need to first find out how much he spends in a month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

We can calculate Keenan's monthly expenditure as follows:

Keenan's monthly expenditure = Total monthly expenditure - Madeline's monthly expenditure
= $400 - (60% of $400)
= $400 - 0.6 x $400
= $400 - $240
= $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4 to find out how much he spends per week:

Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
= $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate each day.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of 60 pieces. To find this, we can multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = 24

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a poultry expert with extensive knowledge of chicken farming and market analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the cost price of the chickens, we need to calculate the total revenue Isaias plans to generate from selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens at $50 each. 

First, let's calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell: 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.

Next, we'll calculate the total revenue: 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000.

Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, we need to subtract the desired profit from the total revenue to find the cost price: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we need to find out how many glasses the boys sold together. To do this, we'll subtract Julie's sales from the total number of glasses sold.

32 glasses (total) - 14 glasses (Julie) = 18 glasses (Micah and Mitchell)

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses they sold by 2.

18 glasses / 2 = 9 glasses per person

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales.

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

The final answer is: 5"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a textile expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

The final answer is: $10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Melanie's age in 10 years will be 18. To find her current age, we subtract 10 from 18, which gives us 8. So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age. Thrice her present age means 3 times her current age, which is 3 * 8 = 24.

To find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24, we subtract 8 from 24, which gives us 16. Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a personal finance expert. Let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping expenses to determine how much she has left in her budget.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart. The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12. The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12. Lastly, the cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

"As a concert promoter and event planner, I've had the pleasure of working with various artists, including Elaina. When it comes to calculating the runtime of her usual concerts, I consider the total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, and then adjust it according to the given information.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Total runtime of the final concert = 65 minutes
2. Encore time = 15 minutes
3. Runtime of the final concert without encore = 65 - 15 = 50 minutes
4. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can set up the equation: 2x = 50, where x represents the runtime of the usual concert.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: 25"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave away a total of 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys.

Total toys given away = 40 + 80 + 30 = 150

Now, let's subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food industry expert with a focus on menu planning and inventory management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays and then add them to the total.

Since they make twice as many chimichangas on Fridays, we can calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays as 2 x 125 = 250.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 125 + 125 + 250 = 500.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a stage management expert. I'd be happy to help you with arranging microphones on a stage.

To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs, we can calculate the number of microphones that won't fit as 20% of the total number of microphones.

Let's calculate the number of microphones that won't fit: 20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10.

The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is the total number of microphones minus the number of microphones that won't fit: 50 - 10 = 40.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife enthusiast and ornithologist. I'd be happy to help you with the bird count.

To calculate the total number of birds, we need to break it down into three groups: birds in the bushes, birds flying overhead, and birds feeding.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds per group:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, let's add up the total number of birds:

6 (in the bushes) + 4 (flying overhead) + 24 (feeding) = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this cookie distribution problem.

To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we need to subtract the number of cookies Lani ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

Total cookies baked = 55
Cookies eaten = 5

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Since Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars, we can divide the remaining cookies by 5.

Cookies in each jar = Cookies left / 5
Cookies in each jar = 50 / 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

The final answer is 10."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in horticulture. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The orchids have 5 petals per flower, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The daisies have 10 petals per flower, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

To find the difference in the number of petals, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist with expertise in plant classification and garden management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these are indoor plants. To find the number of indoor plants, we can calculate:

Number of indoor plants = Total number of plants * (1/4)
= 100 * (1/4)
= 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:

Remaining plants = Total number of plants - Number of indoor plants
= 100 - 25
= 75

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. To find the number of outdoor plants, we can calculate:

Number of outdoor plants = Remaining plants * (2/3)
= 75 * (2/3)
= 50

Finally, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:

Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Number of outdoor plants
= 75 - 50
= 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we can divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

Percentage of flowering plants = (Number of flowering plants / Total number of plants) * 100
= (25 / 100) * 100
= 25%

Therefore, 25% of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mechanical engineer with expertise in kinematics. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To find the speed of the whirligig, we need to understand the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and the thingamabob. We're given that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, and the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Since the whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster, its speed is 11x. We're also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. We can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster. So, the speed of the whirligig is:

Speed of whirligig = 5x
= 5 * 11
= 55 meters per second

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with Ellen's daily expenses.

Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. She consumes two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we can divide the total cost of carrots by the number of carrots Ellen consumes, which is 2. So, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find Mark's new weekly income, we need to calculate his hourly wage first. His original wage was $10 per hour, and it increased by $2 per hour. So, his new wage is:

$10 + $2 = $12 per hour

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

$12 per hour * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = $480 per week

Therefore, Mark's new weekly income is $480."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Tasha made $80 in total from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know that she earned $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, we can represent the number of times she mowed each lawn as x.

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x. We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80, so we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate John's profit, we need to first find his total monthly earnings from renting out his car. Since he rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 per hour, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total hours worked per month = 10 hours * 3 hours = 30 hours
Total earnings per month = 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

Now, we subtract his car payment of $500 from his total earnings to find his profit:

Total profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Total profit = $750 - $500
Total profit = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit from renting out his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph. If Martha bought 5 more notebooks, she now has a total of 7 notebooks. We can represent the number of notebooks Joseph had as 'x'. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7 + 5 (since Martha bought 5 more notebooks)

Combine the constants on the right side:
3x = 12

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:
x = 12 / 3
x = 4

So, Joseph had 4 notebooks initially.

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 4 = 3

Therefore, Martha has 3 more notebooks than Joseph."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis.

To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we need to calculate Anis' distance first. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 * Dijana's distance)
Anis' distance = 50 + (1/5 * 50)
Anis' distance = 50 + 10
Anis' distance = 60

Now, we can find the total distance rowed by both of them:

Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we need to divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. To do this, we'll use division.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies ÷ Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 ÷ 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'll be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Denise read 10 pages yesterday and Daniel read 13 pages. To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel yesterday, we can simply subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read.

Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages, and Daniel read 13 pages. The difference is 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Now, let's look at today's reading. Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. So, Denise read 18 - 23 = -5 pages more than Daniel.

However, since we can't have a negative number of pages, we can rephrase the question to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel. We can do this by subtracting the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise and then taking the absolute value of the result.

The correct calculation is |18 - 23| = |-5| = 5 pages.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a textile expert with extensive experience in calculating fabric requirements for various sewing projects. I'd be happy to help you determine the total material needed for Jo's face masks.

To calculate the total material required, we need to calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we know that 4 small masks can be made with 2 yards of material. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can divide the total number of masks by 4 and multiply by 2:

20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards
So, 5 sets of 2 yards are needed for small masks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 yards.

For large masks, we know that 3 large masks can be made with 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can divide the total number of masks by 3 and multiply by 2.25:

8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = 8 / 3 = 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards
So, 2.67 sets of 2.25 yards are needed for large masks, which is 2.67 * 2.25 = 6 yards.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks:

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can represent this information using an equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

To solve for Adam's current age, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"

First, let's calculate the time for a normal sudoku: 45 minutes. Then, we'll calculate the time for an extreme sudoku, which takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku: 4 * 45 minutes = 180 minutes.

The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 minutes + 180 minutes = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

However, since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to first find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

Since Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a car maintenance expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days. Since Jon drives 100 miles a day, we can multiply the daily mileage by the number of days:

Total miles = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles = 3000 miles

Since Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can divide the total number of miles by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

They bought a cake for $11 and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, they bought 12 balloons. So, the cost of the balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.

The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: 
x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"

= $0.3

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pet care expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total number of pets Larry has.

To find the total number of pets, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we'll calculate the number of rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Now, let's calculate the number of fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

We also know that the number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Finally, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is the sum of Abby's and Josh's slices: 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist with a specialization in shell collection and analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we need to calculate the number of months she has been collecting shells. Since she started collecting shells at 5 years old and now she is 10 years old, the number of months she has been collecting shells is:

10 years - 5 years = 5 years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is:

60 months * 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in sloth behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the time constraint of 8 hours and the time it takes for the sloth to make a round trip (4 hours). Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he can pick per trip as follows:

Total berries desired = 24
Number of trips = 2

To find the number of berries per trip, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

Berries per trip = Total berries desired ÷ Number of trips
= 24 ÷ 2
= 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is 12."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days and subtract it from the initial amount in the tank.

The tank is initially filled with half the amount of water in the pool, which is 5000 gallons. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

The total amount of water used over 6 days is 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

Now, let's subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:
5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons.

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Colby's movie-going expenses to determine how many movies he can see.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry chef with extensive experience in baking and nutrition. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked.

To determine the total calories, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert with extensive experience in pest management. I'd be happy to help you calculate the average number of Junebugs removed by Rita.

To find the total number of Junebugs removed, we need to add up the Junebugs removed each day. 

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs per day. Since there are two days, the total for Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how much farther the bus went than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. We can do this by multiplying the speed of each vehicle by the time it traveled.

The bus traveled at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance it traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance it traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

Now, we need to find the difference in distance between the bus and the car. To do this, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can represent their ages as variables: P for Peter, P + 10 for Paul (since Paul is 10 years older than Peter), and J for Jean.

We can write the equation: P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 2P + J = 90

Now, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age: P = (P + 10) + J

Substituting P = (P + 10) + J into the equation 2P + J = 90, we get:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expanding the equation, we get: 2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides: 2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2: P + J = 35

Now, we have two equations: P + J = 35 and P = (P + 10) + J

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get: P + J - (P + 10 + J) = 35 - (P + 10 + J)

This simplifies to: 0 = 25

This is a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption is incorrect. However, we can still solve the problem.

Let's go back to the equation P + J = 35. We know that P = (P + 10) + J, so we can substitute P + J = 35 into this equation:

(P + J) + 10 = 35

Subtract P + J from both sides: 10 = 35 - P - J

Subtract 10 from both sides: 0 = 25 - P - J

Add P + J to both sides: P + J = 25

Now, we have two equations: P + J = 35 and P + J = 25. This means that P + J = 35 and P + J = 25 are two different equations with the same solution.

Since P + J = 35, we can substitute P = 35 - J into the equation P = (P + 10) + J:

35 - J = (35 - J) + 10 + J

Simplify: 35 - J = 35 + 10

Subtract 35 from both sides: -J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1: J = -10

Now that we have J, we can find P:

P + J = 35
P + (-10) = 35

Subtract -10 from both sides: P = 45

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the water balloon count.

Let's break it down step by step. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each. To find the total number of balloons, we can multiply the number of friends by the number of balloons each had:

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Maria also had 1 balloon for herself, so we add that to the total:

8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:

5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons:

9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

So, the total number of water balloons is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a professional event planner with expertise in logistics and organization. I'd be happy to help you with your yard sale.

To determine the number of tables needed, we need to calculate the total number of boxes and then divide that by the number of boxes that can fit on each table.

The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes each, which equals 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. They also have 10 boxes already, making a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2.

Number of tables needed = Total boxes / 2
= 60 boxes / 2
= 30 tables

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed = Total tables needed - Existing tables
= 30 tables - 15 tables
= 15 tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate all the donated items.

Final answer: 15"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and a math whiz. I'm excited to help you with the watermelon seed spitting contest problem.

To find the total distance spat by Zoey, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.

Similarly, for Sydney, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

Now, to find the total distance spat by both, we add the distances spat by Zoey and Sydney: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are 2 people): 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a hotel management expert with extensive experience in room pricing strategies. Let's break down the calculation to determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the extended stay option.

To calculate the cost of the extended stay, we need to consider the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours beyond that. Since Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark.

The cost of the initial 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:

50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, he spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends a total of:

5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, we subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining earnings:

250 - 50 = 200 dollars

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:

200 - 100 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25:

100 / 25 = 4

The final answer is 4."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially purchased 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of:

Total Cost = Number of CDs × Price per CD
Total Cost = 10 × $15
Total Cost = $150

Since James received a 40% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount:

Discount Amount = Total Cost × Discount Percentage
Discount Amount = $150 × 0.4
Discount Amount = $60

After the discount, James had a total cost of:

New Total Cost = Total Cost - Discount Amount
New Total Cost = $150 - $60
New Total Cost = $90

Now, James sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total amount of:

Total Amount from Selling CDs = Number of CDs Sold × Price per CD
Total Amount from Selling CDs = 5 × $40
Total Amount from Selling CDs = $200

To determine how much James was out, we subtract the total amount he received from selling the CDs from the new total cost:

Amount James Was Out = New Total Cost - Total Amount from Selling CDs
Amount James Was Out = $90 - $200
Amount James Was Out = -$110

James actually lost $110.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a swimming enthusiast and a recreational math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To calculate the total time James takes to cross the lake, we need to break down his journey into three segments: swimming, resting, and swimming again.

First, let's calculate the time James spends swimming 60% of the distance at 2 miles per hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = (0.6 * 20 miles) / 2 miles per hour
Time = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour
Time = 6 hours

Next, James rests for half as long as the swimming time.

Rest time = Swimming time
Rest time = 6 hours

Now, James swims the remaining 40% of the distance at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.

Distance = 20 miles * 0.4
Distance = 8 miles

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour
Time = 8 hours

Finally, we add up the time spent in each segment to get the total time.

Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Swimming time
Total time = 6 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 20 hours

"As a bakery management consultant, I can help you determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has.

To find the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday. 

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is 7 * 70 = 490.

Since the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had, we subtract 40 from 490. 

490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. To find Marcus's age, we can simply subtract 5 from Deanna's age.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. To find Leo's age, we can multiply Marcus's age by 2.

Leo's age = 2 * Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 * 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's 45 points. We also know that Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored and 10 more points than Dinar scored.

Let's denote the number of points Dinar scored as x. Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Bahati scored x + 10 points. And since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points.

We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we know Dinar scored 15 points, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:

Azibo scored (x + 10) - 20 points
= (15 + 10) - 20
= 25 - 20
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is: 5"

To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

Number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
= 2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
= 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a productivity expert. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of reports Vince stapled.

To determine the total number of reports, we need to calculate the total minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. There are 12 hours in 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 11 hours in 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM. 

Total minutes = (12 hours * 60 minutes/hour) + (11 hours * 60 minutes/hour)
Total minutes = 720 + 660
Total minutes = 1380 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports.

Total reports = 1380 / 15
Total reports = 92

The final answer is 92."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sleep specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day.

To determine the total minutes Kim slept, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early. 

First, let's calculate the total minutes Kim usually sleeps in a day. Since she goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 6 a.m. = 6 hours * 60 minutes = 360 minutes
Total minutes = 120 + 360 = 480 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom. We need to subtract these minutes from the total minutes she slept:
480 - 5 = 475 minutes

Additionally, Kim woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:
475 + 23 = 498 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{498}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in kitchen management and utensil organization. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

To find 2/3 of 24 cups, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3:
(2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. He gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a healthcare consultant with expertise in hospital management and capacity planning. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds and then subtract the number of patients admitted during that period.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied. To find the initial number of occupied beds, we can calculate 1/5 of 1000:

1/5 × 1000 = 200 beds

Since 200 beds are occupied, the number of unoccupied beds is:
1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so:
2 weeks = 2 × 7 = 14 days

With 50 patients admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 × 14 = 700 patients

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
800 - 700 = 100 beds

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a data analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of non-work emails:

Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find out how many of these non-work emails are to family. Since two-thirds of the non-work emails are to family, we can calculate this as:

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find out how many of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend. Since one-third of the non-work emails are to her boyfriend, we can calculate this as:

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this basketball-themed problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. We're also given that Jason carried 2 balls. 

Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine Jeffrey's ball count by dividing Jason's balls by 2:
Jeffrey's balls = Jason's balls / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 2 / 2
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Now, we know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so we can calculate Jordan's ball count:
Jordan's balls = 2 * Jason's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 2
Jordan's balls = 4

To find the total number of balls, we add the balls carried by each boy:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a treasure hunter and expert in archaeological excavations. I've been studying the island's topography and the pirates' digging patterns to determine the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.

Let's break down the information:

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). To find the total number of holes by the end of the third day, I added these numbers together: 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, I multiplied the total number of holes by 4: 4 * 29 = 116 holes.

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, I subtracted the total number of holes by the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day: 116 - 29 = 87 holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"

"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a Pokémon researcher with a passion for understanding the intricacies of Pokémon distribution and behavior. I'm here to help you solve the puzzle of catching them all!

Let's dive into the problem. We know that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokémon. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

To solve this, let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We can start by setting up the equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a television show enthusiast and expert in episode analysis. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of episodes, we need to divide the total minutes per episode by 2, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you calculate the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.

To find the total distance, we need to consider the bird's movements in each direction. The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 30 miles/hour × 10 hours
= 300 miles

Then, the bird travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18 miles/hour × 2 hours
= 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 22 miles/hour × 5 hours
= 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:

Net Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
= 264 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry expert with a passion for baking. I'd be delighted to help you with your question.

To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, let's break down the situation step by step.

Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies. Her friends then brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. To find the total number of brownies, we need to add these amounts together.

Total brownies = 12 (initial brownies) + 6 (office party brownies) + 48 (friends' brownies)
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To find the number of brownies left over, we subtract the number eaten from the total.

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Nani's age is 8 years. His brother is twice his age, so his brother's age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

To find Nani's sister's age, we need to calculate 25% of Nani's age and subtract that from Nani's age. 25% of 8 is 0.25 x 8 = 2 years. So, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all three family members: 8 (Nani) + 16 (brother) + 6 (sister) = 30 years.

The total age of the family members is 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"

The number of players in Zeke's team = 13 + 7
= 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we simply add the number of players in each team.

Total number of players = 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team)
= 33

Therefore, there are 33 players in both teams combined.

The final answer is: 33"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a landscape designer with expertise in calculating perimeter and area for various outdoor projects. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of wooden slats needed, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats needed:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for his 15-foot by 10-foot rectangular fence.

The final answer is: 100"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges, with each box containing 20 oranges. To find out how many oranges she had, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of oranges per box:

12 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

Next, she gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, for a total of 4 boxes given away. We calculate the number of oranges given away:

4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges

Now, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the original 240 oranges:

1/4 * 240 oranges = 60 oranges

To find out how many oranges she had left, we subtract the oranges given away and the ones she kept from the initial total:

240 oranges - 80 oranges - 60 oranges = 100 oranges

Since she sold the rest, the number of oranges she sold is 100 oranges.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is the sum of the individual costs: $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we subtract this amount from the total cost to find the amount he still needs: $39 - $14 = $25.

Now, we divide the amount needed by Tyler's hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

We're given that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. We know Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we need to determine Richard's share first.

Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find Jerry's share by subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating earnings from sales. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Sunny earned from selling gingerbread and apple pie, we need to calculate the total earnings for each day and then add them together.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 each, so his earnings from gingerbread on Saturday are 10 * $6 = $60. He also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. The price of each apple pie is $15, so his earnings from apple pie on Saturday are 6 * $15 = $90.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. His earnings from gingerbread on Sunday are 15 * $6 = $90. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, so his earnings from apple pie on Sunday are 15 * $15 = $225.

Now, let's add the earnings from both days: $60 + $90 + $90 + $225 = $465.

The final answer is: $465"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Emil is currently 19 years old. We need to find the sum of his dad's and brother's ages now, knowing that when Emil turns 24, he'll be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.

Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We know that E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he'll be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation: 24 = D/2.

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides by 2, which gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he'll be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation: 24 = 2B.

To solve for B, we can divide both sides by 2, which gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

Her mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a seafood expert with a focus on crawfish. Let's break down Joe's crawfish catch:

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to calculate the amount he caught each day:

Thursday: 3 pounds
Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Total amount of crawfish caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group. 

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a shoe size expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a landscape designer with expertise in garden planning and flower bed design. I'd be happy to help you determine the cost of plants for your flower bed.

To calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed, we need to consider the total length of the bed in inches and the space required between each plant. The bed is 111 feet long, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to calculate his daily pretzel intake and then multiply it by 7.

Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 pretzels a day. To find Edgar's brother's daily pretzel intake, we can multiply Edgar's daily pretzel intake by 1/2.

18 pretzels * 1/2 = 9 pretzels

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply Edgar's brother's daily pretzel intake by 7 to find his weekly intake.

9 pretzels * 7 days = 63 pretzels

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert with extensive experience in floral arrangements. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of filling 5 hanging baskets with petunias and sweet potato vines.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then add them together.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as follows: 5 baskets * 3 petunias per basket * $3.00 per petunia = $45.00.

The cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as: 5 baskets * 2 vines per basket * $2.50 per vine = $25.00.

Now, let's add the costs together: $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

Therefore, Katherine will spend a total of $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a gardening expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many roses Artemis can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds

Now, we add the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Since they have a 30-pound bag of soil, we subtract the total amount used from the total amount available:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. To find 25% of $2,000, we can multiply:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate how many pairs she can afford to buy in a month:

$500 (monthly savings) ÷ $1,000 (pair price) = 0.5 pairs per month

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year:

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

The final answer is: 6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive experience in seafood preparation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the tasks into two separate components: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp peeled per minute
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time as follows:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp cooked per 10 minutes
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 30
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 3 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by adding the time for peeling and cooking:

Total time = Time to peel 90 shrimp + Time to cook 90 shrimp
Total time = 15 minutes + 3 minutes
Total time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mechanical engineer specializing in HVAC systems. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, let's break down the cooling and warming effects.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour. This results in a total cooling effect of 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour. This results in an additional cooling effect of 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

The total cooling effect is the sum of these two effects: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Since the room will warm up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running, and it was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

The final temperature is the starting temperature minus the total cooling effect plus the warming effect: Final temperature = Starting temperature - 18 + 4 = Starting temperature - 14.

Since we don't know the starting temperature, we can represent the final temperature as a difference from the starting temperature. Let's call the starting temperature 'x'. Then, the final temperature is x - 14.

The question asks how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is. Since the final temperature is x - 14, it is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you solve the problem.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time.

To find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. Since Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 90

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can find the number of times it has orbited in 60 years by dividing 60 by 75, which is 0.8 (or 4/5).

However, we don't need to calculate the number of orbits. We just need to find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet, and 15 years have passed since then (60 years - 45 years, which is the time it takes for the comet to return), we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by adding 15 to 30, which is 45 years.

Therefore, Bill was 45 years old when his dad saw the comet.

The final answer is 45."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Buford's check-writing frequency.

To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes. 

First, let's calculate the total number of checks he writes per month: 
- Electric bill: 1 check per month
- Gas bill: 1 check per month
- Church donations: 2 checks per month
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with extensive knowledge of flight schedules and routes. Let's break down the information provided to determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France in one day.

We know that the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Since 3/4 of these flights are to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as follows:

3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the flights to Greece from the total number of flights:

88 - 66 = 22 flights

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, we divide the result by 2:

22 / 2 = 11 flights to France

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in one day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in canine behavior. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the combined length of time, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and add them together. 

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total age of the children is 20, and we have the ages of Akbar (A = 3) and Alessandro (S = 4). We're also given that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5.

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we can calculate her age as 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10.

Let's calculate Wilfred's age: W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10 = 3.

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Walter's lawyer's contribution.

To determine the amount Walter's lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. Walter initially collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund. The total amount collected is $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

But wait, Walter's friend is going to give him $200. This amount will be subtracted from the total amount collected, so the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food scientist with expertise in food distribution and portion control. Today, I'll be happy to help you with dividing a watermelon among a family of 6.

To divide the watermelon, we need to consider the ratio of adult to child portions. Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

We know the total number of slices is 6, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66.67\%}$"

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to first find the total number of boxes sold. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars together, we can divide 64 by the total number of boxes to find the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Number of chocolate bars in a box = 64 / 8

To avoid any potential division errors, let's use a fraction to represent the division:

Number of chocolate bars in a box = 64 ÷ 8

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

Number of chocolate bars in a box = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dance instructor with 5 years of experience in managing dance studios. I'd be happy to help you calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio.

To determine the expected earnings, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio per week is $25 per session, and the studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the cost of renting the studio per week is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of renting the studio per month is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the cost of students' lessons per week is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. In a month, the cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

The final answer is: $480"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem.

"As a wildlife biologist specializing in mammalian populations, I can provide a detailed analysis of the porcupine population in the park.

To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the initial population, the number of female porcupines, and the birth rate.

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. To find the total number of new porcupines per month, we multiply the number of female porcupines by the birth rate:

Number of new porcupines per month = 30 * 4 = 120

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of new porcupines in a year is:

Total new porcupines per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total new porcupines per year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

Final answer: 1490"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pool engineer with over 10 years of experience in designing and maintaining swimming pools. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of filling the Smith family's pool.

To calculate the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth of the pool.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with the pick-up sticks problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know there are 9 red sticks. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks by adding 5 to the number of red sticks.

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

Now, we're told that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we can calculate the number of yellow sticks by subtracting 3 from the number of blue sticks.

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water resource management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, let's break down the water pumped each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Maria's power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours and then loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. We also know that the final charge remaining is 28%.

Let's denote the initial charge as x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 45%

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - 45% - (7% * 3) = x - 45% - 21%
x - 66% = 28%

To find the value of x, we can add 66% to both sides:

x = 28% + 66%
x = 94%

So, the initial charge of the power bank was 94%.

The final answer is: 94"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment.

To determine the total amount Janet needs to save, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment."

He bought 4 pears at $0.75 each, so 4 x $0.75 = $3
He bought 2 kiwis at $1 each, so 2 x $1 = $2
He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 x $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10 initially and spent $10.25, he actually doesn't have enough money to buy any plums. However, to find out how many plums he can buy with the money he has left, we can calculate the remaining amount:

$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

Since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we'll consider the initial $10 as the remaining amount. 

Now, let's calculate how many plums he can buy with $10:

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost of one plum:

$10 ÷ $0.25 = 40

Since Jamaar can't buy a fraction of a plum, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Jamaar can buy 40 plums.

Final answer: 40"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to first calculate the total number of pieces given away. Since there are 15 packs in total, and Anne kept 2 packs, the number of packs given away is 15 - 2 = 13.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces given away is 13 * 60 = 780.

Since the sweets were given to 10 friends equally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by 10:

780 ÷ 10 = 78

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a grocery store analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the price of carrots after three years.

To calculate the price increase, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount (initial price), r is the annual interest rate (5% in this case), and n is the number of years.

Given the initial price of carrots is $120, we can plug in the values into the formula:

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120 * 1.157625
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a data analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of portraits and selfies, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The final answer is: 18"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a reading specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total time James spends reading, we need to calculate the time it takes him to read 18 pages. Since James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find the time it takes him to read 1 page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

10 minutes ÷ 3 pages = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by the total number of pages he reads:

3.33 minutes per page × 18 pages = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: 60"
"As a hotel operations expert, I can break down the situation step by step to determine the current number of guests.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. After 24 guests checked out early, the number of guests remaining is 100 - 24 = 76.

Then, 15 guests checked out late, leaving 76 - 15 = 61 guests.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. The number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, so the total number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."

To find the number of easy questions, we can calculate 40% of the total questions in the quiz. 

Let's calculate 40% of 60:
40% = 0.4
0.4 * 60 = 24

Since the remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, we can find the number of each type by dividing the remaining questions by 2:
60 - 24 = 36
36 / 2 = 18

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as 'x'. Since the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We also know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12.

Now, let's say Teresa sold 's' number of large stuffed animals and '2s' number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down Suzanne's earnings and expenses to determine how much money she has left.

To calculate her total earnings, we need to add the money she earned from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240. Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

Next, we need to subtract the amount she gave her sisters, which is 2 x $10 = $20. So, her remaining earnings are $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The final answer is: $300"

The friends found 60 eggs."
"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a mining engineer with expertise in optimizing mining operations. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe. As we know, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf's productivity increases to 24 pounds per day, and with a steel pickaxe, it's 36 pounds per day.

Since we have 40 dwarves, the total daily ore production with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the monthly production, we multiply this by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I've analyzed the pricing strategy of the store and can help you determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

The store offers three package sizes: 2 sandwiches for $3, 4 sandwiches for $6, and an unknown price for 8 sandwiches. Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to find the unknown price.

Let's denote the unknown price as x. We can set up the proportion as follows:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 4 * 3
2x = 12

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $6.

Final answer: $6"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much Tom has to pay per month, we need to calculate the remaining amount he owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons at each stage.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst:
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

Now, we calculate the number of red balloons remaining:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

Then, we calculate the number of yellow balloons remaining:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

We also need to find the number of blue balloons added:
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

Now, we add up the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to first determine the number of medium beans he can eat. Since it takes 75 large beans to fill him up and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, we can calculate the number of medium beans as follows:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Now, we know that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. To find the number of small beans, we can divide the number of medium beans by 3:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a physics enthusiast and expert in kinematics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total distance he needs to cover and then multiply it by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sewing expert with extensive experience in creating custom comforters. When it comes to calculating fabric requirements, I always follow a straightforward approach.

To determine the amount of fabric needed for Jim's king-sized comforter, we need to calculate the area of the comforter. Since the comforter is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we'll add 2 feet to both the length and width of the bed.

The bed measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Adding 2 feet to both dimensions, we get:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2 to account for both pieces:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim will need 160 square feet of fabric to complete his comforter.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have three people dividing an amount of $1920. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a project manager with expertise in resource allocation and time tracking. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total hours worked by each painter, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, let's calculate the total hours worked by the team. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total hours worked as follows:

Total days worked = 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
Total hours worked = 21 days * 3/8 days/hour = 7.875 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:

Hours worked per painter = Total hours worked / Number of painters
= 7.875 hours / 4
= 1.96875 hours

To convert this to a more readable format, we can multiply by 100 to get the hours in a more familiar format:

Hours worked per painter ≈ 196.875 hours

The final answer is: 196.875"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this tennis ball retrieval problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We can represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in depreciation calculations. I'd be happy to help you with finding the price of the car in 2010.

To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the depreciation formula:

Price = Initial Price * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years

In this case, the initial price is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% or 0.21, and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Price = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
Price = $20,000 * (0.79)^3
Price = $20,000 * 0.631519
Price ≈ $12,704.38

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,704.38.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a librarian with extensive experience in cataloging and book collections. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we need to first calculate the number of books written in English and German. Since half of the books are written in English, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25

Next, we know that 10% of the books are written in German. We can calculate this as:

Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books:

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)
= 50 - (25 + 5)
= 50 - 30
= 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

The final answer is 20."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a travel expert with extensive knowledge of road trips across the United States. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven (325 kilometers) from the total distance (1955 kilometers).

Distance remaining = Total distance - Distance driven
= 1955 km - 325 km
= 1630 km

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a water conservation specialist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we need to multiply the number of cups she drinks per day by the number of days.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day. 
So, in 30 days, she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups of water.

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can divide 240 cups by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on passenger flow and crowd dynamics. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, let's break down the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 100 people board the train. To find the new total, we subtract the number of people who descended (50) from the current total (140) and then add the number of people who boarded (100): 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, so we subtract 80 from the current total of 190: 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: 110"

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a flooring expert with over 10 years of experience in tile installation. I'd be happy to help you with your kitchen floor renovation.

To calculate the total cost of the tiles, we need to determine the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 

200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating James' insurance costs.

To determine the increased cost, we need to calculate 60% of the normal cost and add it to the normal cost. 

60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

The increased cost is $72. To find the total cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

$120 + $72 = $192

Since James has to pay this amount for a month, we need to multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost:

$192 x 12 = $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a laundry expert with extensive experience in managing household laundry. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total number of loads, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

For twin beds, we have 4 beds, and Greg does laundry every week. Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we can calculate the number of loads as follows:

Number of twin loads per week = 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads

Since the laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads as follows:

Number of king loads per week = 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

To find the total number of loads per week, we need to divide the total number of loads by 3, as the machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time.

Total loads per week = (208 twin loads + 52 king loads) / 3
= (208 + 52) / 3
= 260 / 3
= 86.67 (round up to 87 since you can't do a fraction of a load)

Now, multiply the total loads per week by 52 weeks to find the total number of loads per year:

Total loads per year = 87 * 52
= 4524

The final answer is: 4524"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, they watch 4 / 2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies
Total movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks = 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 16 + 8 = 24 movies

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 24 movies in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sticker enthusiast and collector. I'd be happy to help you with Leo's sticker collection.

To determine the total number of stickers Leo has, we need to calculate the stickers he had two years ago, last year, and this year.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers, so he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.
This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.
Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 350 stickers in his collection."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a feline nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you determine how long 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's three cats, who are fed twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each.

To calculate the total daily consumption, we need to multiply the amount fed per day (60 grams) by the number of cats (3). This gives us a total daily consumption of 60 grams * 3 = 180 grams.

Now, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the total daily consumption (180 grams) to find out how many days it will last:

720 grams / 180 grams per day = 4 days

Therefore, the cat food will last 4 days."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
Total slices = 4 × 8
Total slices = 32

Now, let's focus on the information about Becky's and Jake's eating habits. We know Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. We can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3

To solve for Jake's slices, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now that we know Jake's slices, we can find Silvia's slices. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2 × Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 × 7
Silvia's slices = 14

Now that we know how many slices each person ate, we can find the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Betsy and Donovan worked together to make a meal, and Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Now that we know Donovan's part is 40 minutes, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a medical billing specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the cast is $200. The doctor charges $300 for a 30-minute visit, so we need to calculate the hourly rate: $300 / 0.5 hours = $600.

"As a productivity specialist, I'd be happy to help you calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.

To find the number of emails James responds to, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

20% of 80 emails is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with calculating John's average score.

To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. In this case, John scored 100 on his first three tests and 80 on his fourth test. Let's calculate the total score:

Total score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
= 380 / 4
= 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a logistics expert with extensive experience in managing mail operations. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor.

To determine the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00.

The total cost of postage is $7.00 + $21.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and expert in culinary calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to consider the initial number of sandwiches, the number eaten, and the additional ones ordered.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 sub sandwiches. Mark ate 4 of them, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. Then, Sidney ordered 3 more, bringing the total to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches.

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry chef with extensive experience in baking croissants. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the cost of the butter, we need to calculate the total amount of butter Dennis needs and then apply the discount.

Since Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen, he requires 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. To find the amount she spent, we can multiply 60 by 1/4.

1/4 * 60 = 15

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60.

1/3 * 60 = 20

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$120 - $35 = $85

Therefore, Maggie and Riza have $85 left.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this banana-related problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day.

First, let's find out how many bananas the first monkey eats per day. We know that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we need to subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas. The first two monkeys eat a total of 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

Now, let's subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas:
315 - 24 = 291 bananas

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the remaining bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day:
291 ÷ 7 = 41.57 bananas per day

Since we can't have a fraction of a banana, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the third monkey eats 41 bananas per day.

The final answer is 41."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a florist with 5 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to first calculate the total cost of the roses. Since she bought 15 roses, we can calculate the cost in two ways:

1. 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30
2. 1.25 dozen roses * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since the cost of the roses is $30, and she has $25, she is short $5. To find out how many quarters she will leave with, we need to calculate the number of quarters that makes up the remaining $5.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can divide the remaining amount by the value of a quarter:

$5 ÷ $0.25 = 20 quarters

So, Jenny will leave with 20 quarters."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on scheduling and logistics. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total waiting time for Paul at the train station.

To determine the total waiting time, we need to analyze the arrival and departure times of each train. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find out how many toothpicks Melanie needs to collect, we first need to determine how many toothpicks she has already saved. Since she saves 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks, we can calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved as follows:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required (200) to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10):

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a finance expert with a specialization in discount calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the original price, we need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Since he bought it at 75% of its original price, we can set up the equation:

Sale Price = 0.75 * Original Price

We know the sale price is $2000, so we can solve for the original price:

$2000 = 0.75 * Original Price
Original Price = $2000 / 0.75
Original Price = $2666.67

Now, let's calculate the discount Mr. Rogers' friend received when buying the watch at 120% of the price he bought it. The sale price is 1.2 times the price he bought it, which is:

Sale Price = 1.2 * $2666.67
Sale Price = $3200

To find the discount, we subtract the sale price from the original price:

Discount = Original Price - Sale Price
Discount = $2666.67 - $3200
Discount = -$533.33

Since we're looking for the percentage discount, we'll divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100:

Percentage Discount = (Discount / Original Price) * 100
Percentage Discount = (-$533.33 / $2666.67) * 100
Percentage Discount ≈ -20%

The negative sign indicates that Mr. Rogers' friend received a discount, but we're interested in the magnitude of the discount, so we'll ignore the negative sign.

The final answer is 20%."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist specializing in the study of jellyfish populations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate, we need to consider the rate of jellyfish creation per hour. Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can calculate the rate as follows:

Rate of jellyfish creation per hour = 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour

Now, if 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is:

Total jellyfish created per hour = 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:

Total jellyfish created in 4 hours = 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually:
10 bunches * $0.80 per bunch = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

Since the result is negative, it means Jenny actually spent more money by buying in bunches instead of individually. However, if we want to find out how much she saved, we can take the absolute value of the result:
$22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. Let's dive into the problem at hand.

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to determine the amount of fence each person gets. Since they're splitting the 100 feet of fence, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: 80"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in reptile growth patterns. When analyzing the growth rate of crocodiles, it's essential to consider their unique physiological characteristics and environmental factors.

To determine the total growth in 13 years, we can use the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

Annual growth rate = Total growth / Number of years
= 8 inches / 4 years
= 2 inches/year

Now, we can use this rate to find the total growth in 13 years:

Total growth in 13 years = Annual growth rate * Number of years
= 2 inches/year * 13 years
= 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: 26"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bike enthusiast and a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles.

To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply it by its price.

First, let's find the number of Trekking bikes sold:
Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Next, let's find the number of BMX bikes sold:
Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Now, let's find the number of MTB bikes sold:
Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:
Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * $450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * $250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * $500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"As a farm management specialist, I can analyze the situation and provide a detailed breakdown of the hay production and harvesting process.

To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer and the truck are producing and consuming hay. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck consumes 3 bales per hour.

Let's calculate the net change in bales per hour:

Net change in bales per hour = Farmer's production - Truck's consumption
= 5 bales/hour - 3 bales/hour
= 2 bales/hour

Since the farmer and the truck work for 6 hours, the total net change in bales is:

Total net change in bales = Net change in bales per hour * Number of hours

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, let's calculate the total minutes John spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60. 

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert this to inches by multiplying 6 by 12. This gives us 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so we add 2 inches to the first child's height: 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so we subtract 5 inches from the second child's height: 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so we add 3 inches to the third child's height: 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a paleontologist specializing in Mesozoic-era dinosaurs. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this, let's break it down step by step. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat, which is half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate. Let's call the amount left after the T-Rex ate 'x'. Since the velociraptors ate half of what was left, we can set up the equation: x/2 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 540.

Now, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, so the T-Rex ate 540/2 = 270 kilograms.

To find the initial amount, we add the amount the T-Rex ate to the amount left after the T-Rex ate: 270 + 270 = 540.

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 540 kilograms.

Final answer: 540"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a professional painter with over 5 years of experience in residential painting projects. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall and add them together. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a probability expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Ellen had 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. She took 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas. The friend can choose from 7 sodas.

To find the probability of the friend getting a shaken can, we divide the number of shaken cans by the total number of cans:

P(shaken can) = Number of shaken cans / Total number of cans
= 2/7

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(shaken can) = (2/7) * 100
= 28.57%

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57\%}$"
"As a transportation engineer, I can provide a straightforward solution to this problem.

When two trains are traveling in opposite directions, the distance between them increases at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds. Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 and the speed of the second train as v2. We are given that v1 = 60 miles per hour and v2 = 30 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = (v1 + v2) * time

Plugging in the values, we get:

Distance = (60 + 30) * 3
Distance = 90 * 3
Distance = 270 miles

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a tax professional with 5 years of experience in helping individuals and small businesses with their tax needs. I'd be happy to assist you with calculating the number of people Billy can help.

To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per hour.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

To calculate the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed. Let's do the math:

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: 2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a time management specialist. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks.

To find the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we need to add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 * 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and a math whiz. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles. We also know that Amber ran 8 miles. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we need to multiply Amber's distance by 3.5.

Micah's distance = 8 * 3.5
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three.

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

To find the new balance, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned one item that cost $15.00. The new balance will be:

$85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

Next, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00

The price after the discount is:

$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To calculate the discount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

$30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00

The price after the discount is:

$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased:

$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

The new balance on her credit card will be:

$70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist specializing in jellyfish behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those change color from green to blue under UV light. This means that the number of large jellyfish that change color is 1/3 of 1/5 of the total number of jellyfish. We can represent this as:

Number of large jellyfish that change color = (1/3) × (1/5) × Total number of jellyfish
= (1/15) × Total number of jellyfish

We're also told that 6 jellyfish changed color, so we can set up the equation:

(1/15) × Total number of jellyfish = 6

To solve for the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides by 15:

Total number of jellyfish = 6 × 15
= 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Chris is 4 years old. We know that Ben is two times older than Chris, so we can calculate Ben's age as follows:

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Now, we're told that Caroline is three times older than Ben. To find Caroline's age, we can multiply Ben's age by 3:

Caroline's age = 3 * Ben's age
Caroline's age = 3 * 8
Caroline's age = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Lauren's current salary is $100,000. She saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. However, she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. This is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. I'm assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

Let's recalculate her annual savings as 20% of her income: 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is still a negative number. I'm assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

To calculate how many years it will take Lauren to save for a 20-year retirement period, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings.

Let's assume she saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. To calculate the total amount she needs to save, we can multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.

Now, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings to find out how many years it will take her to save for retirement: $400,000 / $20,000 = 20 years.

However, this is the total number of years it will take her to save for retirement, not the number of years she needs to work. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

To find out how many more years she needs to work, we need to subtract the number of years she plans to live from the total number of years it will take her to save for retirement: 20 years - 20 years = 0 years.

However, this doesn't make sense, as she can't live for 0 years. Let's re-examine the question.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the length of each final cut, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4), and then divide the result by the number of equal parts each part will be divided into (5).

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Length of each part = Total length / Number of parts = 100 cm / 4 = 25 cm
Length of each final cut = Length of each part / Number of final parts = 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of students in the school, we can use the concept of percentages. We know that 40% of the students are boys, and there are 240 boys. Let's set up an equation to represent this situation:

0.4x = 240

where x is the total number of students.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fashion expert with a focus on shoe design. I'd be happy to help you calculate the average height of heels at the party.

To find the average height, we need to add the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels. 

First, let's calculate the total height of the 4-inch heels: 3 x 4 = 12 inches
Next, let's calculate the total height of the 2-inch heels: 3 x 2 = 6 inches
Now, we add the total height of both types of heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Since there are a total of 6 heels (3 of 4 inches and 3 of 2 inches), we'll divide the total height by 6 to find the average height: 18 / 6 = 3 inches

The average height of heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a hiking enthusiast and outdoor enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with Soledad's hiking plans.

To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we need to calculate the total number of miles she needs to cover in 30 days. 

The total number of miles Soledad wants to hike is 9,300 miles. To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we can divide the total number of miles by the number of days:

9,300 miles ÷ 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day:

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fruit expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much each person gets, we need to calculate the amount each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

Since the question asks about the remaining amount, we need to subtract the total amount Pierre and Paul have from the initial 12 kg.

The total amount Pierre and Paul have is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

The remaining amount of apples is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students last year and add it to the number of students last year.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Number of students last year = 50
Number of students this year = 50 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a lighthouse engineer. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we need to first find the time it takes for the light to blink once. 

Since the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can divide 5 minutes by 255 to find the time it takes for the light to blink once.

Time per blink = 5 minutes / 255 blinks = 0.0198 minutes per blink

Now, we can multiply the time per blink by the total number of blinks to find the total time.

Total time = 0.0198 minutes per blink * 459 blinks = 9.05 minutes

So, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9.05}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fish enthusiast and aquarium expert. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break down the initial number of fish in Tate's garden pond:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Tate then buys 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes. We need to update the counts:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish:

Total female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfish) = 16
Total male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfish) = 11

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is: 16 - 11 = 5

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a household management expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total time, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on route optimization and distance calculations. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total distance driven by John in a month, we need to consider the round trip distance. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since it's a round trip, the total distance is twice the one-way distance:
Total Distance = 2 * 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:
Total Distance per Month = 280 miles * 2
Total Distance per Month = 560 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a geography enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we need to first find out how far Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can multiply the number of days by the daily distance to get the total distance walked by Sofie.

Distance = Number of days * Daily distance
Distance = 7 * 10
Distance = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the distance Sofie walks by 2 to find out how far Brian walks.

Distance walked by Brian = Distance walked by Sofie / 2
Distance walked by Brian = 70 / 2
Distance walked by Brian = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a production management specialist with expertise in optimizing manufacturing processes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then find the difference between the total required toys and the toys produced by the first four workers.

The first four workers consist of two workers producing 6 toys per hour and two workers producing 4 toys per hour. Let's calculate their combined production rate:

Worker 1 & 2: 2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys
Worker 3 & 4: 2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys

Total toys produced by the first four workers = 120 + 80 = 200 toys

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

Now, let's find the production rate of the fifth worker. The total number of toys required is 220, and the first four workers produced 200 toys. So, the fifth worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

Production rate of the fifth worker = 20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys/hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a canine nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

So, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether.

The final answer is: 45"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. To find out how many stickers Kris had initially, we can simply add the stickers he kept to the ones he gave away: 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Now, we know that Luis received half of the stickers from Seth and then gave half of those to Kris. Since Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 2 * 16 = 32 stickers initially.

Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, we can find out how many stickers Seth had by doubling the number of stickers Luis had: 2 * 32 = 64 stickers.

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: 90"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in seabirds. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to calculate half of the earth's circumference and then divide it by Alfie's daily flying distance.

The circumference of the earth is approximately 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance.

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a car enthusiast and speed expert. I'd be happy to help you find the speed of the fastest car.

To determine the speed of the faster car, we need to follow a step-by-step approach. Let's break it down:

First, we know the average car's speed is 120 mph. Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = Average car speed × 5
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 120 mph × 5
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 600 mph

Now, we're told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:

Speed of faster car = Speed of 2nd fastest car × 1.25
Speed of faster car = 600 mph × 1.25
Speed of faster car = 750 mph

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Liam is 16 years old now, and two years ago, his age was twice the age of Vince. To find Vince's current age, we can set up an equation.

Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as x. Since Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age, we can write the equation:

16 - 2 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

14 = 2x

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 14/2
x = 7

Now, we need to find Vince's current age. Since 2 years have passed, we add 2 to his age two years ago:

Vince's current age = x + 2
Vince's current age = 7 + 2
Vince's current age = 9

The final answer is 9."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this egg-cellent puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. We can write an equation: A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. We can write two equations: C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

Since C = S + 12, we can substitute this into the first equation, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and the boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. So, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Finally, let's add the weight of the crayons and boxes to find the total weight:

Total weight = Weight of crayons (in pounds) + Weight of boxes (in pounds)
= 12.5 + 12.5
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a forestry expert with a focus on wood processing. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks he can create from the tree. 

First, we need to determine the usable length of the tree. Since John can make logs out of 80% of the tree, we calculate the usable length as follows:

80 feet (total length) * 0.8 (80% usable length) = 64 feet

Now, we divide the usable length by the length of each log (4 feet) to find the number of logs:

64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we multiply the number of logs by 5:

16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks

John sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank:

80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96

The final answer is: $96"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. So, her brother earns 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a fitness enthusiast and walking expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Grandma walks 3 miles every day, consisting of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We also know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

First, let's find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 2 miles on the beach. Since she walks at a constant speed, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, so we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach:

40 minutes / 2 miles = x minutes / 2 miles

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 20 minutes

This means it takes Grandma 20 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach.

Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. So, it will take her:

20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes

to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

Now, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time:

20 minutes + 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 30 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we need to calculate the remaining amount she needs to save. Since she saves $4 per week, we can find the remaining amount by subtracting the amount she has already saved from the total amount:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount already saved
= $60 - $32
= $28

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the amount she saves per week to find the number of weeks it will take:

Number of weeks = Remaining amount ÷ Amount saved per week
= $28 ÷ $4
= 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we need to determine how many marbles he has after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24.

If Bob has 60 marbles after receiving 24 more, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of marbles:

Initial marbles + 24 = 60

To solve for the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

Initial marbles = 60 - 24
Initial marbles = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we can find the final number of marbles by subtracting 10 from the initial number:

Final marbles = Initial marbles - 10
Final marbles = 36 - 10
Final marbles = 26

The final answer is 26."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a thermodynamics expert. Let's dive into this problem.

To solve this, we need to consider the temperature of the water in both mugs. We know that Donny can drink the water if it's at least 40 degrees. 

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees. Since Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. We can set up an equation based on the heat transfer:

m1 * c1 * (T1 - T2) = m2 * c2 * (T2 - T1)

where m1 and m2 are the masses of the water in the 33-degree and unknown mugs, c1 and c2 are the specific heat capacities of the water in the 33-degree and unknown mugs, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures of the water.

Since the specific heat capacities of water are the same in both mugs, we can simplify the equation:

m1 * (33 - T2) = m2 * (T2 - 40)

We know that the total amount of water is 5 ounces, so m1 + m2 = 5. We can express m2 as 5 - m1 and substitute it into the equation:

m1 * (33 - T2) = (5 - m1) * (T2 - 40)

Since m1 is the mass of the 33-degree water, we can express it as 4/5 of the total mass (4/5 * 5 = 4 ounces). Now we have:

4 * (33 - T2) = (5 - 4) * (T2 - 40)

Simplifying the equation:

132 - 4T2 = T2 - 40

Combine like terms:

5T2 = 172

Divide by 5:

T2 = 34.4

The temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. Since 34.4 degrees is less than 40 degrees, we can conclude that the temperature of the second mug is at least 40 degrees.

Final answer: 34.4"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm management specialist with expertise in animal husbandry and agricultural economics. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks.

To determine the total number of animals, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added each day and then add them to the initial number of animals.

Initial number of cows: 50
Initial number of chickens: 20

Number of cows added per day: 20
Number of chickens added per day: 10

Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

Total number of cows added: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of chickens added: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a bagel connoisseur and expert in bagel economics. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount, we need to first find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. 10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we can find the cost of each bagel by dividing the total cost by 9, since there are 9 bagels in each pack. 

$36.00 ÷ 9 = $4.00

So, each single bagel will cost $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many scoops he ate, we can simply subtract 5 from 23.

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Now, we're told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's first find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 18 scoops.

1.5 potatoes/scoop * 18 scoops = 27 potatoes

However, we need to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, not how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. Since Gomer ate 5 scoops less than 23 scoops, we need to subtract 5 scoops from 23 scoops.

23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops

Now, we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops. To find out how many potatoes he ate, we multiply 18 scoops by 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Chester's egg consumption to determine the total number of dozens he'll need for 60 days.

To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs, we can add the eggs he consumes in the first 30 days to the eggs he consumes in the next 30 days. 

First, let's calculate the eggs he eats in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, we'll calculate the eggs he eats in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we'll add the eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is 20."

Let's break down the problem step by step. Adam wants to open a rock stand and invest all his $100. He buys rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each. However, he only sells 60% of his inventory.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cartoonist with expertise in project management and time estimation. To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's break it down:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with that.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. Since there are three dozen eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs as follows:

3 dozen eggs = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs

Now, let's divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

So, each child will receive 9 eggs."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a marine biologist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total cost of food for Jen's fish.

To determine the total cost of food for Jen's fish in May, we need to multiply the number of days in May (31) by the daily cost of food per fish ($1).

Total cost = 31 * $1
Total cost = $31

So, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a florist with extensive experience in rose arrangements. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we need to consider the sequence of events. First, she gave 24 roses to her mother, which reduced her initial stock. Then, she bought 15 more roses to replenish her supply.

Let's calculate the total number of roses Patricia has now:

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in calculating average speeds. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken. 

First, we find the total distance traveled: 
Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, we find the total time taken: 
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: 
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistics expert. When it comes to calculating the probability of independent events, I always follow the rule of multiplication. In this case, we have two independent events: Mark buying a lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and buying a second ticket that's three times more likely to win.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning. The probability of the first ticket winning is 0.2, and the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

Now, let's calculate the probability of both tickets winning: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's dive into the problem of finding out how many seashells each person got when they divided the total number of seashells equally among themselves.

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seashells first. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's represent the number of seashells Carlos collected as x. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can find out how many seashells Carrey collected. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, we can set up another equation:

22 = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 11

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells. To find the total number of seashells, we can add up the number of seashells each person collected:

Total seashells = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

Each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down Mason's carrot consumption to determine his weekly intake.

To calculate Mason's total carrot consumption, we need to consider his eating habits on weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, he consumes 4 carrots per day, and there are 5 weekdays. This gives us a total of:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On the weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots per day, and there are 2 weekend days. So, his weekend carrot consumption is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, let's add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a music enthusiast and audio engineer. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total time of the cassette.

To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the length of the second song first. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.6 * 5 = 3 minutes
So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.
The length of the second song = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
Total time = 5 + 8 = 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in profit calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, we calculate the total cost of the devices. Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. The cost of each device is $20. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = 2 * $20 + 4 * $20
Total cost = $40 + $80
Total cost = $120

Next, we calculate the total selling price. Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. He sold 6 devices in total (2 on Monday and 4 on Tuesday). So, the total selling price is:

Total selling price = 6 * $40
Total selling price = $240

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

Therefore, Linus earned a profit of $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step:

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:

Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

Finally, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. To find the length of Carl's cane, we can divide his height by 2:

Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 feet / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert with a focus on beverage production and consumption. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people and then divide it by the number of bottles each juice can cover.

Energy demand per person = 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand
Energy demand per person = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2
Total energy demand of 2300 people = 0.2 * 2300 = 460 people's energy demand

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 460 people's energy demand.

Number of bottles needed = 460 people's energy demand / 20% of 1 person's energy demand
Number of bottles needed = 460 / 0.2
Number of bottles needed = 2300

However, Hortex can only produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we can subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the total number of bottles needed.

Additional bottles needed = 2300 - 4200
Additional bottles needed = -1900

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a statistician with expertise in probability calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Carla has 8 identical octuplets. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. To find the total number of babies wearing purple, we can calculate:

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6

Now, we're told that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, the number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the number of blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers:

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * 6 (purple wearers) + 2 (blue wearers)
= 2 + 2
= 4

To find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can use the formula:

Probability = (Number of purple bow wearers) / (Total number of bow wearers)

First, let's find the number of purple bow wearers:
Number of purple bow wearers = 1/3 * 6 (purple wearers)
= 2

Now, we can calculate the probability:
Probability = 2 / (2 + 2)
= 2 / 4
= 1/2
= 0.5
= 50%

The final answer is 50."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a tax expert with extensive experience in analyzing tax reports. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Let's break it down:

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received - (Reports received on Monday and Tuesday + Reports received on Thursday and Friday)
= 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a real estate expert with extensive knowledge of land sales and calculations. Let's break down Abraham's land sales step by step.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = $25 per square meter. Since he sold 40 square meters, his total earnings from this sale are 40 * $25 = $1000.

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. This means he sold 20 square meters (80 / 4 = 20) at $30 per square meter. His total earnings from this sale are 20 * $30 = $600.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so his earnings from this sale are 20 * $3 = $60.

To find the total amount Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land, we need to add the earnings from each sale: $1000 + $600 + $60 = $1660.

The final answer is: $1660"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find Geb's age, we need to first find half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, we can calculate half of her age as follows:

Half of Haley's age = 26 / 2 = 13

Since Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age, we subtract 10 from 13:

Geb's age = 13 - 10
Geb's age = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old.

2 face masks/day * 3 times/day = 6 face masks/day

Now, to find the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

6 face masks/day * 2 days = 12 face masks

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs. Let's calculate the total number of eggs found: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

Now, let's subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a waste management specialist. I'd be happy to help you with calculating John's weekly earnings.

To determine John's total weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the payment per collection.

The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 1.6 times the number of apartments. Therefore, the last complex has 400 * 1.6 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's add up the total number of apartments: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in avocado cultivation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to consider the production patterns described in the problem.

Let's break it down year by year:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 times the initial amount, so 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 times the initial amount, so 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 times the amount from Year 2, so 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 times the amount from Year 3, so 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 times the amount from Year 4, so 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 times the amount from Year 5, so 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 times the amount from Year 6 minus 200, so 10 * 7350 - 200 = 73500 - 200 = 73400 fruits
Year 9: No fruit production
Year 10: 20 times the initial amount, so 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's add up the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 73400 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this rope length problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We have three ropes with different lengths: red, blue, and yellow. We know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. We also know that the combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. We can write the following equations based on the given information:

B = Y - 7
R = 4B
Y + B + R = 37

We can substitute the expression for B in terms of Y into the third equation:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mural artist with expertise in color theory and composition. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

To determine the amount of red paint used, let's break down the information given. We know that the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can represent the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. The amount of yellow paint is also 'x', as half the mural is yellow.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12. Simplifying this equation, we get 4x = 12.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4, which gives us x = 3.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home decor expert. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total area of Tom's house.

To find the total area, we need to calculate the area of each room and add them together. Let's start by finding the area of the bedrooms. Since there are 4 bedrooms, each measuring 20 by 12 feet, we can calculate the area of one bedroom as follows:

Area = Length x Width
Area = 20 x 12
Area = 240 square feet

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is:

Area = 5 x 240
Area = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together:

Total Area = Area of 4 bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of rest of the house
Total Area = 4 x 240 + 1200 + 1000
Total Area = 960 + 1200 + 1000
Total Area = 3160 square feet

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and add them together. Since the number of clouds doubles each day, we can use a simple formula:

Total clouds = 3 + 2 * (2^4 - 1)

Here's the calculation:

Total clouds = 3 + 2 * (2^4 - 1)
= 3 + 2 * (16 - 1)

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk, we need to calculate the remaining amount of chalk and then divide it by the daily usage rate.

The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the used amount from the total:

Remaining chalk = Total chalk - Used chalk
= 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches)
= 5 inches - 2.25 inches
= 2.75 inches

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the teacher to use up the remaining 2.75 inches at a rate of 20% per day. We can set up an equation:

Remaining chalk = 2.75 inches
Daily usage = 0.20 * Remaining chalk

Let's solve for the number of days (x):

2.75 = 0.20x

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and student. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the number of students not on varsity, we need to first find the number of students on varsity. We know that one-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

Number of girls on varsity = 1/3 * 12 = 4
Number of boys on varsity = 1/4 * 12 = 3

Total number of students on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7

Total number of students in the class = 12 + 12 = 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dental hygienist with over 5 years of experience. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and then divide it by the total number of teeth.

Number of teeth drilled = 4
Number of teeth capped = 7 + 4 = 11 (since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills)

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 + 11 = 15

Total number of teeth = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is 50."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this age-related puzzle.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

We're given two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's represent Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we can write an equation:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

Now, let's represent the second statement in an equation:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to first find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000. We know that 100 books cost $500, so we can divide the total amount by the cost of 100 books.

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets of 100 books

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find out how many sets each school will get.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

Now, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find out the total number of books each school will get.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. I'd be happy to help you figure out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy.

To determine the total number of slices needed, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then divide that by the number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

So, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

We know Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. To find out how many slices each person ate, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate.

Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nurse with extensive experience in managing hospital supplies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation: x + 15 = 78.

To solve for x, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: x = 78 - 15.

x = 63

The final answer is: 63"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with extensive knowledge of restaurant operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we need to consider the number of people who entered at each time.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total is now 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is now 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating costs and expenses. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost, we need to first find the cost of the scotch and the cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:
$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle

The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. To find the cost of the cognac per bottle, we multiply the cost of the scotch by 1.5 (100% + 50%):
$60 × 1.5 = $90 per bottle

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:
$600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in forest ecology. I'd be happy to help you with the tree-planting problem.

To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information given:

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we need to first determine the loan amount and then subtract the amount used to pay off debts.

The loan amount is 40% of the house's value, which is $250,000. To calculate this, we multiply the house's value by 0.4.

Loan amount = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we need to find 60% of the loan amount, which is used to pay off debts.

Amount used to pay off debts = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount to find the amount leftover.

Amount leftover = Loan amount - Amount used to pay off debts

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a parenting expert with a focus on childcare and household management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break it down step by step. Since Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diaper changes needed is:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan will also change half of the diapers. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we can divide the total number of diaper changes by 2:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a materials scientist with expertise in packaging and material properties. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the packing efficiency. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, so its volume is:

V = length × width × height = 6 × 6 × 15 = 540 cubic inches

However, the jelly beans are not packed perfectly, so we need to account for the packing efficiency. Assuming a random close packing of spheres (which is a common assumption for jelly beans), the packing efficiency is approximately 0.64. Therefore, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

N = V / (packing efficiency × volume of a single jelly bean)
= 540 / (0.64 × 0.15)
= 540 / 0.096
= 5625

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 × 5625
= 1687.5

However, we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

Difference = 1687.5 - 900
= 787.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{787.5}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on bus capacity management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The bus had an initial capacity of 200 people and 20 people were already on board when it departed from Chengli city.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.
3. At the second station, 3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop boarded the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.
4. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.
5. To find the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in budgeting and cost analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to break down her expenses into two periods: the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this question.

To find the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"

The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated as 2 x $10 = $20.

To find the total amount Ali has to pay John, we need to add these two amounts together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a carpentry expert with extensive experience in measuring and cutting wood. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the length of the longer piece of wood, let's break it down step by step. We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length can be represented as 4x.

We can set up an equation to represent the total length of the board:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a passion for cooking and recipe scaling. When it comes to scaling up a recipe, it's essential to consider the ingredient ratios to ensure the final product turns out as expected.

In Aiden's case, he's making meatballs and wants to know how much of his secret steakhouse seasoning he needs for 80 meatballs. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required.

To find the number of pounds of meat needed, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the yield per pound: 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds.

Now, we can multiply the number of pounds by the seasoning ratio: 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons.

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for 80 meatballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home decor expert. When it comes to calculating fabric requirements for curtains, I always follow a simple yet effective approach.

To determine the total amount of fabric needed, we need to calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by the desired width of the fabric. In this case, Luke has 5 windows, each measuring 35 inches wide. 

First, let's calculate the total width of the windows:
Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke wants to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

To make it easier to work with, let's convert the total fabric needed to a more manageable unit, such as yards. There are 36 inches in 1 yard, so:
Total fabric needed (yards) = Total fabric needed (inches) / 36
Total fabric needed (yards) = 350 / 36
Total fabric needed (yards) = 9.72 yards

Therefore, Luke should buy approximately 9.72 yards of fabric to cover his 5 windows with 35-inch wide curtains.

The final answer is: 9.72"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating costs and expenses. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to consider the two different pricing tiers: $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes and $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes.

Let's calculate the cost for each part of the call:

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00.

The final answer is: $8.00"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this cupcake and brownie conundrum.

Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let the number of cupcakes be x, then the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

Since each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4 yields:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a beauty expert with extensive knowledge of salon services and pricing. Let's break down the costs for Karen's beauty treatment.

To calculate the total cost, we need to first apply the 20% discount to the combined price of the manicure and pedicure. The original price of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40, so the total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we need to add the cost of nail art for each of Karen's fingers. Since she has 10 fingers (5 on each hand), the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost by adding the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure and the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a magazine subscription expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to consider the number of issues each magazine sends. 

First, let's calculate the total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues each. This can be calculated as 3 x 12 = 36.

Next, we have the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year. This is a straightforward calculation: 1 x 6 = 6.

Now, let's consider the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. This can be calculated as 4 x 6 = 24.

To find the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this painting puzzle.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. We can represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8. Samantha's paintings, which are 12 fewer than Shelley's, can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We're given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides gives us:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"

"As a tennis instructor, I can break down Charlie's earnings into two categories: standard lessons and veteran lessons. 

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. To find the total earnings from these lessons, we multiply the number of lessons by the rate:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we calculate the earnings from the veteran lessons. Charlie has 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran, and his rate is reduced by 25% of the standard rate. To find the reduced rate, we first calculate 25% of the standard rate:

25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

Now, we subtract the reduction from the standard rate to find the reduced rate:

$80 - $20 = $60

We then multiply the reduced rate by the number of lessons:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we need to first determine the number of pomelos she had initially and then subtract the number she has left. Since Eve had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can set up the equation:

Initial amount - 1/4 * Initial amount = Pomelos given away

Let's represent the initial amount as 'x'. We know that 1/4 of 'x' is equal to 5 pomelos. So, we can write the equation as:

x - 1/4x = 5

To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

3/4x = 5

Now, we can multiply both sides by 4/3 to isolate 'x':

x = 5 * 4/3
x = 20/3
x = 6.67 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a pomelo, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Eve initially had approximately 6.67 pomelos, but since we can't have a fraction of a pomelo, we'll consider the whole number part, which is 6.

Now, we can find the number of pomelos Eve gave away by subtracting the number she has left from the initial amount:

6.67 - 5 = 1.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a pomelo, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Eve gave away approximately 1 pomelo.

The correct answer is: 1"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially bought 60 apples. To find out how many he ate, we need to calculate 2/5 of 60.

2/5 * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Now, we know Walter ate 24 apples. To find the remaining number of apples, we subtract 24 from 60:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Next, we need to calculate 25% of the remaining apples, which Walter gave to his sister. To do this, we'll find 25% of 36:

25% of 36 = (25/100) * 36 = 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples

Now, we subtract the apples given to his sister from the remaining apples:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, Walter sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total amount of money he received, we multiply the number of apples sold by the price per apple:

27 * 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation engineer with expertise in route planning and analysis. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we need to first determine the total hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, Michael traveled for 3 days, so the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Next, we can calculate the distance covered by multiplying his average speed by the total hours traveled:

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition expert with a focus on fruit consumption and food preparation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the initial number of grapes, let's break down the information provided. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of grape juice. This means her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a culinary expert with a focus on comfort food. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to consider the cost of the ingredients. The pasta costs $1.00 per box, and Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the cheese: 
Cost of cheddar cheese per week: $3.00
Cost of gruyere cheese per week: 2 * $3.00 = $6.00
Total cost of cheese per week: $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

Now, let's add the cost of pasta to the total cost of cheese:
Total cost per week: $1.00 + $9.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is:
$10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a facilities management expert with experience in scheduling and time management. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to first find the total time spent cleaning. Since the custodian has 80 classrooms and spends 15 minutes per classroom, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Total time spent cleaning = Number of classrooms * Time spent per classroom
= 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom
= 1200 minutes

Now, we need to convert the total time to hours:
Total time spent cleaning = 1200 minutes / 60
= 20 hours

Next, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days:
Total hours worked = 5 days * 8 hours/day
= 40 hours

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:
Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (Total time spent cleaning / Total hours worked) * 100
= (20 hours / 40 hours) * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a book lover and book organization expert. I'd be happy to help you determine the number of bookcases Elly needs.

To calculate the total capacity of the shelves, we need to consider the capacity of each shelf. Since the middle two shelves can hold 10 books each, the total capacity of these shelves is 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 ÷ 55 = 2

To be safe, we should round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating Rose's profit.

To determine Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of dozens by the cost per dozen:

Total Cost = Number of Dozens * Cost per Dozen
= 5 * $2.40
= $12

Next, let's find the total number of eggs:
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

Now, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 * $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost
= $60 - $12

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and educator. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct as follows:

Total questions needed = 0.7 * 110
Total questions needed = 77

Now, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test:

Questions right on the first test = 0.6 * 70
Questions right on the first test = 42

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right:

Questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions right on the first test

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast and problem solver. I'd be happy to help you with this ice cube conundrum.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, with the number of blueberry cubes being 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. We can represent the number of strawberry cubes as 'x'. Since the total number of ice cubes is 116, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides gives us:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6 yields:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by multiplying the number of strawberry cubes by 5 and subtracting 4:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps. Let's start by calculating the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers to sell 15 cars.

Next, we need to calculate the number of customers Jason needs to get from potential customers. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 potential customers to get 15 customers.

Finally, we need to calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers. Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, Jason needs 30 / 1 = 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a home safety expert. When it comes to emergency lighting, it's essential to have the right equipment to ensure everyone's safety. In this scenario, let's break down the number of candles and flashlights needed.

First, we need to calculate the total number of candles. Since there are 8 rooms in the house, and half of them have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each, we can calculate the total number of candles as follows:

Total number of candles = (4 small candles/room * 4 rooms) + (5 medium candles/room * 4 rooms)
Total number of candles = 16 + 20
Total number of candles = 36

Next, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights. Since there are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight, the total number of flashlights is:

Total number of flashlights = 4

Now, let's add the total number of candles and flashlights to get the overall number of emergency lighting sources:

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 + 4
Total number of candles and flashlights = 40

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and expert in snack distribution. I'd be happy to help you with dividing the nachos among Mitchell's family.

To determine the number of chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is:

2 bags * 55 chips per bag = 110 chips

Now, let's divide the total number of chips by the number of family members (5):

110 chips ÷ 5 = 22 chips per person

So, each person in Mitchell's family will get 22 chips.

The final answer is: 22"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a seasoned Rubik's Cube enthusiast. I've spent countless hours solving the cube and understanding its intricacies. Let's break down the time it takes to solve the cube step by step.

To solve the cube, you need to consider the time it takes to complete each side. The first side takes 5 minutes, as you mentioned. The second and third sides take twice as long, which is 10 minutes each. The last two sides, the fourth and fifth, take half as long as the first side, so they each take 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time it takes to solve the cube:

Time for the first side: 5 minutes
Time for the second and third sides: 10 + 10 = 20 minutes
Time for the fourth and fifth sides: 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 minutes
Total time: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, it takes 30 minutes to solve the Rubik's cube.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a robotics engineer with expertise in inventory management. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the number of helmets is 20, and there are half as many robots as helmets. To find the number of robots, we can divide the number of helmets by 2:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
= 20 / 2
= 10

Next, we're told that the number of helmets is half as many as footballs. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
= 10 + 20 + 40
= 70

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a management consultant with expertise in operational efficiency. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first determine the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week. Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 1800 minutes/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls he deals with in a week by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes/week ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 120"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a professional artist and expert in art conservation. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we need to calculate the difference in drying times.

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

To find the difference in drying time, we subtract the time it takes for the old varnish from the time it takes for the new varnish: 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"

"Hello there! I'm Fatima, a wildlife biologist specializing in amphibian behavior and ecology. I'd be happy to help you with Phineas Frog's journey back home.

To calculate the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to consider the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can calculate the time for each part separately.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in cost calculations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total cost of the phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. The main phone costs $20, and each additional phone costs twice as much as the main phone, which is $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost of the additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a pastry expert with a focus on bakery operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we need to first determine the total number of doughnuts he sells. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day, and there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells per day as follows:

10 dozen doughnuts/day × 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

Since June has 30 days, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is:

120 doughnuts/day × 30 days = 3600 doughnuts

Now, we can calculate Derrick's total earnings by multiplying the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a speech-language pathologist with expertise in assessing and improving communication skills. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

John's original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 
4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food scientist specializing in thermal processing and food technology. I'd be happy to help you with the popcorn problem.

To calculate the total number of popped kernels, let's break down the popping process into four stages:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, 3 times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

So, the total number of popped kernels is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a transportation expert with a focus on route analysis. Let's break down Elvis's journey step by step.

To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, we calculate the distance for each part of the journey:

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in depreciation calculations. I'd be happy to help you determine the value of the boat after three years.

To calculate the value of the boat, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.

Year 1:
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a candy connoisseur and expert in candy analysis. I've been studying the composition of various candy bags, and I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

Let's break down the information given:

We know that the bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies. We also know that there are 54 red candies, twice as many orange candies as red candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

To find the number of pink candies, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a travel expert with extensive knowledge of European destinations. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Helen's trip to Germany.

To determine the total cost of the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips first. Since each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, we can calculate the cost of one bus trip as follows:

Cost of one bus trip = 10% of $80
= 0.1 x $80
= $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

Total cost of bus trips = $8 x 7
= $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus trip cost:

Total cost = $80 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips)
= $136

Therefore, Helen paid a total of $136 for her hotel and bus travels during the trip.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know that Dallas drops 4 marbles in the playground, resulting in 21 marbles. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first determine how many marbles Dallas had initially.

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Dallas' initial marbles = 21 (final marbles) + 4 (dropped marbles)
Dallas' initial marbles = 21 + 4
Dallas' initial marbles = 25

Now that we know Dallas had 25 marbles initially, we can find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting 25 from 52.

Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 52 (Mazie's marbles) - 25 (Dallas' initial marbles)
Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25
Mazie's marbles given to Darla = 27

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm animal nutritionist. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we can calculate the daily feed consumption as follows:

Daily feed consumption = 5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

Total feed consumption in a week = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered feed to find out how much is left:

Feed left = Total ordered feed - Total feed consumed
= 300 pounds - 280 pounds
= 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food scientist with expertise in food planning and logistics. I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost of hot dogs for John's party.

To determine the total number of hot dogs needed, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat. 

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Frances sells cupcakes and cookies, and she buys trays of cupcakes. To determine how much money she has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40. She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her total income from cookies is 40 * $1 = $40. Her total income is $40 + $40 = $80.

Next, we need to calculate her total expenses. She buys 5 trays of cupcakes at $4 per tray, so her total expenses are 5 * $4 = $20.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

The original 5 children are already following the truck. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the total number of children becomes 5 + 5 = 10. This is a simple addition problem.

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30. This is a basic multiplication and addition problem.

The original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a humanitarian aid specialist with experience in disaster relief efforts. I'd be happy to help you with the meal distribution problem.

To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to calculate the total number of meals she has already given out and subtract that from the total number of meals available.

Total meals = 1,360
Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Meals left = Total meals - Meals given out
Meals left = 1,360 - 142
Meals left = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The final answer is: 1218"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family. The age of the sisters is the same, which is 16 years old. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother. 

To find the age of the older brother, we can multiply the age of the younger brother by 2. 

12 * 2 = 24

Now that we know the age of the older brother, we can find the total age of the siblings. We have 2 brothers with ages 12 and 24, and 3 sisters with ages 16 each. 

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all the siblings: 
12 + 24 + (16 * 3) = 12 + 24 + 48 = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a wellness expert with a focus on mindfulness and self-care practices. I'd be happy to help you calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga.

To determine the total time spent on these activities, we need to calculate the time spent on each activity separately and then add them together.

Time spent on meditation:
Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day (morning and evening), which equals 30 minutes per day. Since she does this for 4 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total time spent on meditation is:

30 minutes/day * 2 sessions/day * 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 840 minutes

Time spent on yoga:
Charisma practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. The total time spent on yoga is:

60 minutes/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 840 minutes

Total time spent on meditation and yoga:
840 minutes + 840 minutes = 1680 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we can divide by 60:

1680 minutes / 60 = 28 hours

Therefore, Charisma spends a total of 28 hours on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

28"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a botanist specializing in plant biology. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower and then add 50% more seeds to it.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we multiply 36 by 0.5, which is 18. Then, we add 18 to 36, resulting in 54 seeds.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54) to get the total number of seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."

We know that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. To find Timothy's pens, we can multiply George's pens by 3.

Let's calculate Timothy's pens: 18 * 3 = 54

Now, we know Timothy has 54 pens. Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can divide Timothy's pens by 2 to find Sarah's pens.

54 / 2 = 27

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is 27."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert. To find Anne's height, we can multiply Albert's height by 2:

Anne's height = 2 x 36"" = 72""

We also know Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's height, we can subtract 2"" from Anne's height:

Jackie's height = 72"" - 2"" = 70""

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, we need to subtract 3"" from her current height to find her height before the summer:

Jackie's height before summer = 70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: 67"

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a retail analyst. I'd be happy to help you with calculating the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.

To find the total amount of money Jake spends, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately.

For the T-shirts:
- Original price of each T-shirt: $8
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so the total cost of the T-shirts is 2 x $8 = $16
- Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and 50% off for the second T-shirt.
- The discount on the second T-shirt is 50% of $8, which is 0.5 x $8 = $4.
- So, the cost of the second T-shirt is $8 - $4 = $4.
- The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
- Original price of the shoes: $40
- Jake buys the shoes at 40% off, so the discount is 40% of $40, which is 0.4 x $40 = $16.
- The cost of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a cookie connoisseur and baker. Let's break down Randy's cookie journey step by step.

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He starts with a delicious cookie stash.

For his early day snack, he eats 3 cookies, one of each flavor. This reduces his cookie count as follows:
- Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
- Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:
- Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
- Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

After lunch, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, resulting in:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3
- Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding to his collection:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies Randy has:
10 (oatmeal) + 7 (chocolate chip) + 6 (sugar) = 23

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a landscape architect with expertise in soil erosion and excavation management. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog. Since the dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, the total number of holes dug is:

6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Next, we need to find out how many holes Nate fills in per day. He fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net change in the number of holes per day is:

9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:

84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:

28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a high school math teacher. I'd be happy to help you with the problem.

To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we need to first find the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
= 1000

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. However, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. He also gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. The number of beakers Igor gathered is still 7.

The total number of items Igor gathered is 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 31. However, he only placed 29 items on the lab bench. To find out how many beakers Igor lost, we need to subtract the total number of items he placed on the lab bench from the total number of items he gathered.

31 - 29 = 2

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a carpentry expert with extensive experience in furniture assembly. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we can multiply the number of tables by the number of legs per table and then by the number of screws per leg.

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
= 4 x 4 x 2
= 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can subtract the total screws needed from the total screws he has to find the number of screws left over:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
= 40 - 32
= 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."

"Hello! I'm Fatima, and I'm here to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We have four individuals: Alexandra, Kim, Maryam, and Sarah. We know the following information:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
- Sarah raised $300.

To find the total amount of money raised, we need to add the amounts each person raised: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300.

Let's calculate the total: $430 + $750 = $1180, then $1180 + $700 = $1880, and finally $1880 + $300 = $2180.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a sports enthusiast and running coach. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, and we're given the following information:

- Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, we can represent Vanessa's speed as x miles per minute, and Aaron's speed as 2x miles per minute. We know that Aaron ran 2 miles, so we can set up the equation:

2x * time = 16 minutes

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we can set up another equation:

x * time = 4 miles

Since we're trying to find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we can focus on the second equation. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 4 miles / time

Now, we can substitute the expression for x into the first equation:

2 * (4 miles / time) * time = 16 minutes

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 = 16

This doesn't make sense, so let's re-examine our equations. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and we can represent her speed as x miles per minute. We can set up the equation:

x * time = 4 miles

Since we're trying to find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we can solve for time by dividing both sides of the equation by x:

time = 4 miles / x

We also know that Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, so we can represent Aaron's speed as 2x miles per minute. We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles. We can set up the equation:

2x * 16 minutes = 2 miles

Simplifying the equation, we get:

32x = 2 miles

Dividing both sides of the equation by 32, we get:

x = 2 miles / 32

x = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we have Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by substituting x into the equation:

time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)

time = 4 * 16

time = 64 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

64"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a dock maintenance expert. To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we need to calculate the length of line required for the existing dock. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 * 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

Total line to buy = Total line required - 6 feet
Total line to buy = 600 - 6
Total line to buy = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a restaurant management consultant. I'd be happy to help you calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant.

To determine the total weekly revenue, we need to calculate the daily revenue first. Since Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night and they serve 2 meals per reservation at $5 each, the total revenue from meals per day is:

6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation * $5 per meal = $60

Additionally, they order a $5 bottle of wine per day. So, the total daily revenue is:

$60 (meals) + $5 (wine) = $65 per day

Since Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:

$65 per day * 2 days per week = $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a financial analyst with expertise in calculating profit margins and pricing strategies. I'd be happy to help you with this problem.

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the cost per unit and then apply the profit margin.

First, let's find the cost per unit:

Total cost of 50 watermelons = $80
Cost per unit = Total cost / Number of units
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we need to find the selling price with a 25% profit. To do this, we'll calculate 25% of the cost per unit and add it to the cost per unit.

Profit per unit = 25% of $1.60
= 0.25 x $1.60
= $0.40

Selling price per unit = Cost per unit + Profit per unit
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a math enthusiast. Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John had a son James when he was 19 years old. We also know that James is currently 18 years old, which means he is 18 - 1 = 17 years younger than John.

We're also given that Dora, James' sister, will turn 12 in 3 years. This means Dora's current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we can confirm that James' current age is indeed 2 * 9 = 18 years.

Now, let's find John's current age. We know that James was born when John was 19, and James is currently 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

We're asked to find John's youngest son's age in 3 years. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a nutrition and food science expert. I'd be happy to help you with your question.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. We know that Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. We want to find out how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane in 1 hour (60 minutes).

First, let's calculate the number of oranges each person peels in 60 minutes:

Ana peels oranges at a rate of 1/3 per minute. To find out how many oranges she peels in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60:

Ana peels 60 * (1/3) = 20 oranges in 60 minutes.

Jane peels oranges at a rate of 1/4 per minute. To find out how many oranges she peels in 60 minutes, we can multiply her rate by 60:

Jane peels 60 * (1/4) = 15 oranges in 60 minutes.

Now, let's find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

20 (Ana's oranges) - 15 (Jane's oranges) = 5 oranges.

Therefore, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane in 1 hour.

The final answer is 5."
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a mechanic with over 10 years of experience in car repairs. I'd be happy to help you with Mark's car problem.

To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to first find the discounted price. Since Mark got the radiator for 80% off the original price of $400, we can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the cost of the radiator:

Cost of radiator = $400 - $320 = $80

Next, we need to calculate the labor cost for the mechanic. The labor cost is $50 per hour, and it took 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the labor cost is:

Labor cost = 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to get the total cost:

Total cost = $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator.

"Hello! I'm Fatima, a farm animal expert. I'd be happy to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. We know that the total number of legs is 70, and we have two types of animals: chickens and cows. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs.

We can represent the number of chickens as 'x' and the number of cows as '20 - x'. Since we know the total number of animals is 20, we can set up an equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

To simplify the equation, we can start by distributing the 4:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70

Next, we can combine like terms:

-2x + 80 = 70

Now, let's isolate the variable 'x' by subtracting 80 from both sides:

-2x = -10

Finally, we can divide both sides by -2 to solve for 'x':

x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"Hello! I'm Fatima, a food enthusiast and pizza connoisseur. When it comes to sharing pizzas, I always like to make sure everyone gets an equal share. 

To determine how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, we can calculate the total number of slices as follows:

Total slices = Number of pizzas × Number of slices per pizza
Total slices = 7 × 8
Total slices = 56

Now, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (4):

Slices per person = Total slices ÷ Number of people
Slices per person = 56 ÷ 4
Slices per person = 14

So, each person can have 14 slices."
