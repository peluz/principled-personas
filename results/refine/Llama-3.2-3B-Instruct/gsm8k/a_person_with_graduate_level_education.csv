"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has available for sale. 

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for her friends. Therefore, the number of eggs available for sale is 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings can be calculated as 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we must consider the ratio of blue to white fiber. The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount of white fiber. This implies a direct proportionality between the two types of fiber.

Let's represent the number of white fiber bolts as x. Since the amount of white fiber is half that of blue fiber, we can express this relationship as:

2 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 2/2
x = 1

Now that we know the amount of white fiber required, we can calculate the total number of bolts:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 + 1
= 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit made by Josh after investing in the house, we can employ the concept of percentage increase. 

The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. This can be represented as a percentage increase of 1.5 times the original value. 

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

New value = Original value + (Original value * Percentage increase)
= $80,000 + ($80,000 * 1.5)
= $80,000 + $120,000
= $200,000

The profit made by Josh is then calculated as the difference between the new value and the original price:

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To determine the total distance James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that he runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint covers a distance of 60 meters, we can apply the multiplication operation to calculate the total distance.

The total distance (d) can be calculated as the product of the number of sprints per week (n) and the distance per sprint (m):

d = n * m
d = 3 * 60
d = 180

Therefore, James runs a total of 180 meters per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed requirement for her flock. Given that each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens in the flock, the total daily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, we can calculate the remaining feed needed for the final meal as follows:

Remaining feed = Total daily feed - Feed already provided
Remaining feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Remaining feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can employ a weighted average approach. The cost of the first glass is $5, while the cost of subsequent glasses is 60% of the initial price. This can be represented as:

Total Cost = (Cost of first glass) + (Cost of remaining glasses)
Total Cost = $5 + (15 * 0.6 * $5)

Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can simplify the expression:

Total Cost = $5 + (15 * 0.6 * $5)
Total Cost = $5 + $45
Total Cost = $50

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

Given that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can express this relationship as C = 4S. Additionally, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which can be represented as T = 2C.

We are also given that Seattle has 20 sheep, so S = 20.

Substituting S = 20 into the equation C = 4S, we find C = 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, substituting C = 80 into the equation T = 2C, we find T = 2 * 80 = 160.

To determine the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To determine the total time it takes to download the file, we can break down the process into two distinct phases: the initial download and the subsequent restart.

The initial download phase involves Carla downloading 80% of the 200 GB file, which is equivalent to 160 GB. Given that her download rate is 2 GB/minute, the time taken for this phase can be calculated as follows:

Time = Total data / Download rate
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, this initial download is interrupted by a 20-minute restart. Therefore, we must add this duration to the initial download time to obtain the total time taken for the first phase:

Total time for first phase = 80 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time for first phase = 100 minutes

The second phase involves downloading the remaining 20% of the file, which is equivalent to 40 GB. Again, using the same download rate of 2 GB/minute, we can calculate the time taken for this phase:

Time = Total data / Download rate
Time = 40 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 20 minutes

To find the total time taken for the entire process, we add the time taken for the first phase and the time taken for the second phase:

Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments and apply the principles of kinematics.

Let's denote the distance John initially traveled as $d_1$, the distance he traveled during the standstill period as $d_2$, the distance he traveled at 30 mph as $d_3$, and the distance he traveled at 80 mph as $d_4$. We are given that $d_1 = 60 \cdot 3 = 180$ miles, $d_2 = 0$ miles, and $d_3 = 30 \cdot 0.5 = 15$ miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these segments: $d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4$. We are also given that the total time taken is 4 hours, and John initially drove for 3 hours. Therefore, the time spent driving at 80 mph is $t_4 = 4 - 3 - 0.5 = 0.5$ hours.

We can use the equation $d_4 = v_4 \cdot t_4$ to find the distance traveled at 80 mph. Substituting the values, we get $d_4 = 80 \cdot 0.5 = 40$ miles.

Now, we can find the total distance traveled: $d_{\text{total}} = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 180 + 0 + 15 + 40 = 235$ miles.

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is $d_{\text{total}} - 180 = 235 - 180 = 55$ miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine Eliza's total earnings for the week, we can employ the concept of piecewise linear compensation. Given that her regular hourly rate is $10 and she receives an overtime pay rate of 1.2 times her regular rate, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

Let's denote the number of regular hours worked as 'r' and the number of overtime hours worked as 'o'. We are given that r = 40 and o = 5.

The total earnings can be represented as:

Total Earnings = (r * Regular Rate) + (o * Overtime Rate)
= (40 * $10) + (5 * $10 * 1.2)
= $400 + $60
= $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

Final answer: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into individual components.

Let's denote the number of downloads in the first month as x. Given that the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, we can express this as 3x. Then, the number of downloads in the third month can be calculated by taking 30% off the second month's downloads, which is equivalent to 0.7 * 3x.

Now, we can calculate the total number of downloads over the three months by summing the individual components:

Total downloads = x + 3x + 0.7 * 3x
Total downloads = x + 3x + 2.1x
Total downloads = 6.1x

Since we know that the number of downloads in the first month was 60, we can substitute x = 60 into the equation:

Total downloads = 6.1 * 60
Total downloads = 366

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we can apply the concept of unit prices and the multiplication principle.

Let's break down the costs:

- The cost of 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 × $68 = $204.
- The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 × $80 = $160.
- The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding these amounts together: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can use the concept of net present value (NPV) or simply calculate the number of years it takes to recover the initial investment. 

Let's denote the initial cost of the tree as I, the annual income as R, and the annual expenses as E. We are given I = $90, R = $10.50, and E = $3.

The net profit per year is R - E = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.

To find the number of years it takes to recover the initial investment, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

t = I / (R - E) = $90 / $7.50

t = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, resulting in a total of x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6. Multiply the entire equation by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

6x - (2x + 12 + x - 6) = 30

Combine like terms:

6x - 3x - 6 = 30

Simplify:

3x - 6 = 30

Add 6 to both sides:

3x = 36

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12

Therefore, Melanie initially had 12 vacuum cleaners.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students: 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Finally, we determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we can apply the concept of expected value, which is a fundamental principle in decision-making under uncertainty. The expected value (EV) of each option can be calculated by multiplying the initial cost by the probability of the market increase and adding the result to the initial cost.

Let's calculate the expected value for each option:

For the jewelry:
EV = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
EV = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
EV = $5,000 * 1.025
EV = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
EV = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
EV = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
EV = $8,000 * 1.012
EV = $8,160

Since the expected value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the expected value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The profit can be calculated as the difference between the expected value and the initial cost:

Profit = Expected value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Therefore, the merchant would make a profit of $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets.

The final answer is: $160"
"In this scenario, we have two trains traveling in the same direction, which implies that their east-west displacement is the same. Let's denote the east-west displacement as x. Since they traveled 80 miles westward on the first day, we can express the east-west displacement of each train as x - 80.

On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, the northward displacement of each train is 150 miles. The total displacement of each train can be represented as the sum of the east-west displacement and the northward displacement: (x - 80) + 150.

However, we are not given the value of x, which represents the east-west displacement. To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the east-west displacement (x) and the northward displacement (150 miles) to the total distance traveled.

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (total distance) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the total distance traveled, and the other two sides are the east-west displacement (x) and the northward displacement (150 miles).

Let's denote the total distance traveled as d. Then, we can write:

d^2 = x^2 + 150^2

Since we are not given the value of x, we cannot find the exact value of d. However, we can express the total distance traveled as:

d = √(x^2 + 150^2)

To find the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered on the first day (80 miles) and the second day (150 miles):

Total distance = 80 + 150 = 230 miles

The final answer is: 230"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we can utilize the concept of linear compensation. Given her hourly wages for teaching ($20) and coaching ($30), we can apply the formula for total annual earnings:

Total Annual Earnings = (Number of Weeks Worked per Year) * (Weekly Teaching Earnings + Weekly Coaching Earnings)

In this scenario, Jill works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach. We can calculate her weekly earnings from teaching and coaching as follows:

Weekly Teaching Earnings = 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
Weekly Coaching Earnings = 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Total Annual Earnings = 50 weeks/year * ($700/week + $450/week)
Total Annual Earnings = 50 weeks/year * $1,150/week
Total Annual Earnings = $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

Final answer: $57,500"
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire makes in 4 weeks. Since she makes 3 eggs per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in 4 weeks (28 days). 

Total eggs = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, we can then divide the total number of eggs by 12 to obtain the number of dozens.

Total dozens = 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

Therefore, Claire will consume 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we can employ the concept of average speed and the formula for calculating it: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Given that Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend:

Total Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Total Time = 12 miles / 4 miles/hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, we can find the remaining time by subtracting the time spent from the total time:

Remaining Time = Total Time - Time Spent
Remaining Time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining Time = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance using the formula:

Required Speed = Distance / Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 miles/hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain her desired average speed for the remaining 6 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total amount of water in the combined drinks before and after spilling.

Initially, we have 10 liters of orange drink with a water content of 2/3, and 15 liters of pineapple drink with a water content of 3/5. The total amount of water in both drinks can be calculated as follows:

Water in orange drink = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters
Water in pineapple drink = 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters
Total water in both drinks = 20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
Water in orange drink after spilling = 20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water in the pineapple drink and the water left in the orange drink:
Total water in remaining 24 liters = 9 + 17/3 = 9 + 5.67 = 14.67 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son.

Let's denote Raymond's current age as R and his son's age as S. We know that R = 25 (since Raymond is 6 years younger than Samantha, who is 31) and S = 23.

The number of years ago Raymond's son was born can be calculated as:

Years ago = R - S
= 25 - 23
= 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers, who each purchased one DVD. This can be represented as 3 × 1 = 3 DVDs.

Next, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers, who each purchased 2 DVDs. This can be represented as 2 × 2 = 4 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers did not make any purchases, the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we can find the overall total by adding the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total length reduction of the candle, we must first calculate the duration of the burning period. The time elapsed between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length reduction as follows:

Length reduction = Rate of melting * Time elapsed
= 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
= 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the original price of the book, we can utilize the concept of percentage decrease. Given that the book was purchased at a 25% discount, we can express this as a decimal by dividing the discount percentage by 100: 25% = 0.25.

Let x be the original price of the book. The discounted price can be represented as x - 0.25x, which simplifies to 0.75x. We are given that the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75
x = 26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can employ a straightforward approach by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount she paid. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items other than pizza: 
- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
- 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of other items = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we can find the cost of the pizza boxes by subtracting the total cost of other items from the total amount paid:
$50 - $33 = $17

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, we can calculate the number of boxes by dividing the total cost of pizza boxes by the cost per box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of Mishka's clothing purchases, we can apply the principle of arithmetic summation. Given the costs of each item, we can calculate the total expenditure as follows:

Let's denote the cost of a pair of shorts as S, the cost of a pair of pants as P, and the cost of a pair of shoes as H. We are provided with the following information:

S = $16.50
P = $22.50
H = $42

The total cost of the clothing items can be represented as:

Total Cost = 3S + 3P + 3H

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total Cost = 3($16.50) + 3($22.50) + 3($42)
= $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
= $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items.

Final Answer: The final answer is $243."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia over 60 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each carton contains 15 servings and Cynthia consumes one serving per night, the total number of cartons required can be calculated as follows:

Number of cartons = Total number of servings / Servings per carton
= 60 servings / 15 servings per carton
= 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total cost = Number of cartons * Cost per carton
= 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton
= $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. Let's break down the problem into two segments: the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles.

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. However, this approach yields a negative result, which is mathematically incorrect. This indicates that the initial assumption of the second stop being 15 miles before the end of the trip is incorrect.

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the second stop must be after the end of the trip. Therefore, we can recalculate the distance between the first and second stops as follows:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 miles + 15 miles = 75 miles

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops:
Distance between the first and second stops = 75 miles - 40 miles = 35 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of the boots as x. We are given that the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, which can be expressed as 2 * $33 = $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

We can set up an equation to represent the given information: x - $5 = $99. Solving for x, we get x = $99 + $5 = $104.

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is 104."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of ratios and algebraic manipulation. Let's denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x, as given in the problem statement.

We are provided with the information that their total age is 162, which can be expressed as an equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we obtain:

18x = 162

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate their current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To determine the average guess, we can employ the concept of arithmetic mean. Let's denote the number of jelly beans in the jar as x. The first person's guess is 80, the second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which can be expressed as (80 + 20)/2 = 50, and the third person's guess is 25% more than the first person's guess, which can be calculated as 80 + (0.25)(80) = 100.

Now, we can calculate the average guess by summing the individual guesses and dividing by the total number of guesses: (80 + 50 + 100)/3.

Mathematically, this can be represented as: (80 + (80 + 20)/2 + (80 + 0.25(80)))/3.

Simplifying the expression, we get: (80 + 50 + 100)/3 = 230/3.

Performing the division, we obtain: 230/3 = 76.67.

Therefore, the average guess is 76.67.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76.67}$"
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can apply the concept of multiplication to calculate the daily hours and then scale it to the weekly period.

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can express this as a fraction: 0.5 hours/dog. With 10 dogs, the total daily care time can be calculated as:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find the weekly care time, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days in a week (7):

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

"To determine the number of gold coins Gretchen has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

Given that the total number of coins is 110, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins, we can calculate the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R. We are provided with the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R/2 + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

We can substitute the value of R into the equation for A:

A = (40/2) + 5
A = 20 + 5
A = 25

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation for S:

S = 25 - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the points scored in each segment of the game and then summing them up.

Given that Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes, we can calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes by finding 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes and adding it to the initial 4 points.

Points scored in the first 20 minutes = 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + (25% of 4)
= 4 + (0.25 * 4)
= 4 + 1
= 5 points

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"To determine Terry's total expenditure on yogurts over a 30-day period, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days. Given that Terry consumes 2 yogurts per day, we can calculate this as follows:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we must determine the cost of a single yogurt. The problem states that 4 yogurts are available for $5. To find the cost of one yogurt, we can divide the total cost by the number of yogurts:

$5 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we can calculate Terry's total expenditure by multiplying the number of yogurts consumed by the cost per yogurt:

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75

Therefore, Terry's total expenditure on yogurts over 30 days is $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we can analyze the given information. John initially had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each, resulting in a total revenue of 13 * 15 = $195. He then spent $160 on 8 video games at $20 each, leaving him with $35. 

Let's denote the initial number of Lego sets as x. The total revenue from selling the Lego sets is $15x. Since John spent $160 on video games, the amount he had initially is $195 - $160 = $35. We can set up the equation 15x = 35 to find the initial number of Lego sets.

Solving for x, we get x = 35 / 15 = 7/3. However, since John initially had 13 Lego sets, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. The information provided does not directly state that he sold all his Lego sets, so we cannot determine the exact number of Lego sets he still has. Nevertheless, we can infer that he must have sold at least 6 Lego sets (13 - 7/3) to have $35 left.

However, since the question does not provide any information about the number of Lego sets he has left, we can conclude that the information given is insufficient to determine the exact number of Lego sets he still has.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{N/A}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we can employ the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. Given that John runs 60 miles in a week and 3 days, we can calculate his daily running distance and then find his speed.

First, we need to find the total hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. Therefore, the total hours he runs in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we must first calculate her running and walking speeds. Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and it is half of her running speed, we can deduce that her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which equals 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:

Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled during each activity:

Distance traveled while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
= 12 miles + 12 miles
= 24 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as D.

Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we have:

S = 1

It is also stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so we can express this as:

B = 2S
B = 2(1)
B = 2

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, which can be represented as:

D = 4B
D = 4(2)
D = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we need to establish the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone, which is three times the distance without the gemstone. This can be expressed as:

Distance with gemstone = 3 × Distance without gemstone
= 3 × 400 feet
= 1200 feet

Now, we subtract the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet) from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone to find the distance she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames:

Distance outside reach = Distance with gemstone - Distance dragon can breathe fire
= 1200 feet - 1000 feet
= 200 feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can utilize the concept of subtraction. Given that Grandma Jones initially set out 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces available for consumption can be calculated as follows:

Total number of pieces initially set out = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces

At the conclusion of the event, 14 pieces remained. To find the number of pieces taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total:

Number of pieces taken by the guests = Total number of pieces initially set out - Remaining pieces
= 40 - 14
= 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"To determine the amount of chips you can consume, we need to calculate the remaining calories available in your daily target and then convert that to grams.

Given that you have a daily calorie target of 2000 and have already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, we can calculate the number of servings you can have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

To convert the number of servings to grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving (300g):

0.8 servings * 300g per serving = 240g

Therefore, you can consume 240g of chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we can employ the following steps:

1. Determine the total revenue generated from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
Total Revenue = Number of Candles Sold * Price per Candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

2. Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks, considering that Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the cost of the wick is already accounted for in the initial cost of the pound of wax:
Total Cost = 1 pound * $10.00
Total Cost = $10.00

3. Since Charlie made 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, we can calculate the cost per candle:
Cost per Candle = Total Cost / Number of Candles Made
Cost per Candle = $10.00 / 10
Cost per Candle = $1.00

4. Now, we can calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net Profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into individual components.

First, we need to determine the number of articles written on each day. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which takes 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This can be expressed as 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total time spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 7 * 2 = 14 articles. With each article taking 4 hours, the total time spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total time spent by adding the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. We know that Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse and used 220 notes at work, resulting in 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of notes she had initially is 80 + 220 + 23 = 323.

Since the total number of notes she had initially is the sum of the notes in the package and the notes she already had, we can set up the equation:

80 + x = 323

Subtracting 80 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 323 - 80
x = 243

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 243.

The final answer is: $\boxed{243}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of blue ties purchased and the cost of each type of tie.

Given that John spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 x Number of blue ties
= 2 x 5
= 10

The cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. To calculate the cost of a red tie, we can use the following expression:

Cost of red tie = Cost of blue tie + (Cost of blue tie x 0.5)
= $40 + ($40 x 0.5)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties x Cost of red tie
= 10 x $60
= $600

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on ties by adding the amount spent on blue ties and the amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and division. Given that the wire was initially 4 feet long and then cut into pieces 6 inches long, we first convert the total length of the wire to inches.

Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches is 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to obtain the number of pieces:

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of unoccupied units in the building, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we calculate the total number of units in the building by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4:

Occupied units = Total units * (3/4)
Occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we can employ a straightforward calculation. First, we need to establish the total number of eggs produced per week and then convert this quantity to dozens, as the pricing is given per dozen.

The daily egg production is 252 eggs, and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

To convert this quantity to dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we can apply the concept of average speed, as he travels at a constant speed of 10 mph from 1 to 4 PM and then returns at a speed of 6 mph. 

First, we calculate the total distance traveled, which is the same in both directions. The time elapsed from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours. 

The total distance traveled is 30 miles. 

The total time taken for the round trip is the sum of the time taken for each leg of the journey. 

Time taken from 1 to 4 PM = 3 hours
Time taken from 4 to 1 PM = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

Total time = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 8 hours to get back.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of toys as 'x'. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the total weight of the toys is 0.5x pounds. We know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books. Therefore, the weight of the remaining toys should be equal to 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

We can set up the equation 0.5x = 7.5 to represent this situation. Solving for x, we get:

0.5x = 7.5
x = 7.5 / 0.5
x = 15

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day. 

Let's denote the revenue from truck tires as $T and the revenue from car tires as $C. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

T = 6 * $60 = $360
C = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = T + C = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

C = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = C = $480

Comparing the revenues, we can see that the total revenue on Friday ($480) is greater than the total revenue on Thursday ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue:

Difference = Total revenue on Friday - Total revenue on Thursday = $480 - $520 = -$40

Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday. Therefore, the day with higher revenue is Thursday.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we must first calculate the number of kittens Patchy, the first cat, had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can express this relationship as an equation: P = 3T, where P represents the number of kittens Patchy had and T represents the number of kittens Trixie had.

Given T = 12, we can solve for P by substituting the value of T into the equation: P = 3(12) = 36.

Now, we can find the total number of kittens by adding the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had: Total Kittens = P + T = 36 + 12 = 48.

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that Jean has 30 lollipops initially and consumes 2, the remaining number of lollipops is 30 - 2 = 28.

Now, we can calculate the number of bags by dividing the remaining lollipops by 2, which is the number of lollipops per bag. This can be represented as:

Number of bags = Total remaining lollipops / Lollipops per bag
= 28 / 2
= 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we can employ a simple division operation. 

Let's denote the cost of a ticket as $T and the cost of popcorn as $P. We are given that T = $7 and P = $7. The total amount of money available is $42. 

The number of times Peter can go to the movies can be calculated as:

Number of times = Total money available / (Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn)
= $42 / ($7 + $7)
= $42 / $14
= 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the remaining weight available for the boxes after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck. This can be done by subtracting the combined weight from the bridge's weight limit:

Remaining weight available for boxes = Bridge's weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds

Next, we can divide the remaining weight available for boxes by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight available for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries, we must consider the total amount of the extra fees and the original bill. 

First, we calculate the 25% fee, which is 0.25 times the original bill of $40.00. This yields $10.00. 

Next, we add the delivery fees of $3.00 to the 25% fee, resulting in a total of $13.00 in extra fees.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

Final answer: $57.00"
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we can employ a straightforward approach by summing the number of raspberries in the clusters and the individual raspberries.

Let's denote the number of clusters as 'c' and the number of raspberries in each cluster as 'r'. We are given that c = 6 and r = 20. The total number of raspberries (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = c * r + i

where 'i' represents the number of individual raspberries. Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 6 * 20 + i
T = 120 + i

We are also given that i = 67. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

T = 120 + 67
T = 187

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"To determine the number of good oranges, we can employ a systematic approach. 

First, we need to identify the total number of oranges that are not good. This includes the bad, unripe, and sour oranges. 

Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges: 
Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 
= 0.2 * 25 
= 5 oranges

Next, we add the number of bad and sour oranges to the unripe oranges: 
Total oranges that are not good = 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) 
= 8 oranges

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges: 
Number of good oranges = Total oranges - Total oranges that are not good 
= 25 - 8 
= 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.

17"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be expressed as 0.10 × $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure. Initially, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. After 20 years, her pension becomes a percentage of the total pension value, which is 5% of the initial pension amount.

The total pension value after 20 years is $1,000,000. The annual pension after 20 years is 5% of this value, which is $50,000.

For the remaining 10 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 and an additional 5% of the total pension value. The total pension value after 20 years is $1,000,000, so the additional 5% is $50,000.

The total annual pension for the remaining 10 years is the sum of the fixed pension and the additional 5%:
$50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000

To find the average annual pension, we can calculate the total pension paid over 30 years and divide by the number of years:
Total pension paid = (Fixed pension for 20 years * 20 years) + (Total pension value after 20 years * 10 years)
= ($50,000 * 20) + ($1,000,000 * 10)
= $1,000,000 + $10,000,000
= $11,000,000

Average annual pension = Total pension paid / Total years
= $11,000,000 / 30
= $366,666.67

The final answer is: $366,666.67"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month for 6 months. This can be calculated as:

Total amount paid in the first half of the year = 140 * 6
= $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. The amount of the reduction is 10% of $140, which can be calculated as:

Reduction amount = 140 * 0.1
= $14

The amount paid for the second half of the year is then:

Amount paid in the second half of the year = 140 - 14
= $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount paid for this period is:

Total amount paid in the second half of the year = 126 * 6
= $756

Now, we can find the total amount paid for the entire year by adding the amounts paid in the first and second halves:

Total amount paid = Total amount paid in the first half of the year + Total amount paid in the second half of the year
= 840 + 756
= $1596

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon (mpg) that Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can employ the concept of fuel economy. Given that the car's fuel tank capacity is 12 gallons and the amount of gas used to fill it up is 4 gallons, we can calculate the remaining fuel capacity as 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon as follows:

mpg = Total miles / Total gallons
= 100 miles / 8 gallons
= 12.5 mpg

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles per gallon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"

"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We are given the following information:

1. D = 175
2. R = D - 35
3. E = 2R

We can substitute the expression for R from equation (2) into equation (3) to find the number of emeralds in terms of D:

E = 2(D - 35)
E = 2D - 70

Now, we can express the total number of gems as the sum of the individual types:

Total = D + R + E
Total = D + (D - 35) + (2D - 70)
Total = 4D - 105

Substituting the given value of D into the equation, we get:

Total = 4(175) - 105
Total = 700 - 105
Total = 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we can utilize the given ratio of students to teachers. The problem states that there are 5 students per teacher. 

Let's denote the number of teachers as 't'. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

We can set up the equation 5t = 180, where 't' represents the number of teachers. Solving for 't', we get t = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Thus, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday, bringing the total to 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Given that each class has 15 students, the total number of students can be calculated as 33 * 15 = 495.

"To determine the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as a geometric sequence: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) * 2
= 30

To find the average square footage, we divide the sum by the number of terms:

Average = S / n
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is the sum of these two quantities:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between their laundry quantities.

Given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can express this relationship as:

Sarah's laundry = 4 × David's laundry

We are also informed that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

Raymond's laundry = (1/2) × Sarah's laundry

Now, we can substitute the expression for Sarah's laundry from the first equation into the second equation:

Raymond's laundry = (1/2) × (4 × David's laundry)
Raymond's laundry = 2 × David's laundry

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Using the first equation, we can solve for David's laundry:

400 = 4 × David's laundry
David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Now that we have determined David's laundry quantity, we can find Raymond's laundry quantity:

Raymond's laundry = 2 × David's laundry
Raymond's laundry = 2 × 100
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The original price of the grooming is $100, and the discount offered is 30%. 

The discount amount can be calculated as 30% of $100, which is equivalent to 0.3 * $100 = $30. 

To find the cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total amount of water initially distributed to the girls. Since each girl received 1/6 of the 24 liters, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Total water initially distributed to girls = (1/6) × 24 liters

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator (1) by 24 and divide by the denominator (6):

Total water initially distributed to girls = (1 × 24) / 6
= 24 / 6
= 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

Next, we subtract the amount of water the boy received (6 liters) from the total amount initially distributed to the girls:

Water left = Total water initially distributed to girls - Water received by the boy
= 8 liters - 6 liters
= 2 liters

Therefore, there are 2 liters of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can utilize the given information to establish their individual weights and then perform the necessary arithmetic operations.

Let's denote Grace's weight as G and Alex's weight as A. We are given that G = 125 pounds. Additionally, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight, which can be expressed as A = 4G - 2.

Substituting the value of G into the equation for A, we get A = 4(125) - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, we can calculate their combined weight by adding G and A: G + A = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"
"To determine the total number of thorns, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that each rose bush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns, we can calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the product of the number of roses per bush and the number of thorns per rose.

Let's denote the number of rose bushes as R, the number of roses per bush as r, and the number of thorns per rose as t. We are given R = 3, r = 25, and t = 8. The total number of thorns (T) can be calculated as:

T = R * r * t
T = 3 * 25 * 8
T = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We are given that the total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the number of games won and lost is equal to 22:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we have found the number of games lost (x = 7), we can determine the number of games won by adding 8:

Number of games won = x + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Gene's vacationing duration can be calculated by subtracting his age at the commencement of vacationing (23 years) from his current age (34 years), yielding 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene embarks on four vacations annually, the total number of quilt blocks can be obtained by multiplying the number of years he has been vacationing (11) by the number of shirts he receives from each vacation (4). This results in 11 years * 4 shirts/year = 44 quilt blocks.

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as x. According to the problem, the second ring lasted three times as long, so its duration is 3x. The third ring lasted half as long as the second ring, so its duration is (3x)/2.

The total duration of the alarm ringing is the sum of the durations of each ring. We can express this as an equation:

x + 3x + (3x)/2 = total duration

To find the total duration, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 2. We can rewrite the equation as:

(2x + 6x + 3x)/2 = total duration
(11x)/2 = total duration

Since the problem doesn't provide a specific duration for the alarm, we can assume that the total duration is the sum of the number of times the alarm rang. Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang is equal to the total duration.

Let's calculate the total duration:

total duration = (11x)/2

However, we are not given the value of x. We can express the total number of times the alarm rang in terms of x:

total number of times = (11x)/2

Since we are not given the value of x, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the total number of times the alarm rang in terms of x.

Unfortunately, without knowing the value of x, we cannot provide a numerical answer."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can utilize the concept of compound interest, where the annual increase is applied to the current salary. 

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial salary), r is the annual interest rate (10% in this case), and n is the number of years.

However, since the salary increase is not a fixed interest rate but a percentage of the current salary, we can model this situation using the formula for compound interest with a variable rate:

A = P(1 + r)^n

Here, r is the percentage increase, which is 10% or 0.1 in decimal form. We will apply this formula for each year:

Year 1:
A = 600(1 + 0.1)^1 = 600(1.1) = 660

Year 2:
A = 660(1 + 0.1)^1 = 660(1.1) = 726

Year 3:
A = 726(1 + 0.1)^1 = 726(1.1) = 798.6

Year 4:
A = 798.6(1 + 0.1)^1 = 798.6(1.1) = 878.46

Year 5:
A = 878.46(1 + 0.1)^1 = 878.46(1.1) = 966.306

Year 6:
A = 966.306(1 + 0.1)^1 = 966.306(1.1) = 1062.9366

Year 7:
A = 1062.9366(1 + 0.1)^1 = 1062.9366(1.1) = 1169.23

Year 8:
A = 1169.23(1 + 0.1)^1 = 1169.23(1.1) = 1286.153

Year 9:
A = 1286.153(1 + 0.1)^1 = 1286.153(1.1) = 1414.7683

Year 10:
A = 1414.7683(1 + 0.1)^1 = 1414.7683(1.1) = 1556.24513

Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x. The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

x = 8,000

"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. Given that each adult consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, and there are 20 adults attending the picnic, the total amount required for adults can be calculated as:

Total potato salad for adults = Number of adults * Amount of potato salad per adult
= 20 * 10
= 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for the children. Since each child consumes half the amount of an adult, and there are 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount required for children can be calculated as:

Total potato salad for children = Number of children * Amount of potato salad per child
= 5 * (10 / 2)
= 5 * 5
= 25 pounds

Now, to find the total amount of potato salad needed for the entire picnic, we add the amounts required for adults and children:

Total potato salad required = Total potato salad for adults + Total potato salad for children
= 200 pounds + 25 pounds
= 225 pounds

"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'c', Marcia has as 'm', and Jan has as 'j'. We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so c = 4.

We are also given that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which can be expressed as m = c + 2. Substituting the value of c, we get m = 4 + 2 = 6.

Furthermore, Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which can be written as j = 3m. Substituting the value of m, we get j = 3(6) = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: Total = c + m + j = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three individuals have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the age relationships between the siblings. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as A, J, C, and Y, respectively.

Given information:
1. Y = 10 (James' age)
2. C = Y + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
3. C = A + 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. A = J + 5 (Amy is 5 years older than Jackson)

We can substitute the expression for C from equation (2) into equation (3) to get:
A = (Y + 1) + 2
A = Y + 3

Now, we can substitute the expression for A from the above equation into equation (4):
(Y + 3) = J + 5

Solving for J, we get:
J = Y + 2

Substituting Y = 10 into the above equation, we find:
J = 10 + 2
J = 12

Therefore, Jackson is 12 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the concept of relative speed and the given percentage improvement in Gerald's performance.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x' seconds. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can express Lee's time as x + 2.

We are given that Gerald's diet improvement results in a 10% increase in his speed. This implies that his new time is 90% of his original time, or 0.9x. We are also given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, which is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's new time. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2 = 0.9x

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x + 2 = 0.9x
2 = 0.9x - x
2 = 0.9x - 0.9x + 0.1x
2 = 0.1x
x = 2 / 0.1
x = 20

Now that we have found Gerald's original time, we can calculate his new time by multiplying his original time by 0.9:

Gerald's new time = 0.9x
Gerald's new time = 0.9(20)
Gerald's new time = 18

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, we can express the number of cats in terms of the number of dogs as C = 2D. Additionally, we are informed that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which can be represented as R = D + C - 12.

Substituting C = 2D into the equation for R, we get R = D + 2D - 12 = 3D - 12.

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so D = 60. Substituting this value into the equation for R, we find R = 3(60) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

Total students = 200
Fraction of girls = 3/5
Number of girls = Total students * Fraction of girls
= 200 * (3/5)
= 120

Next, we are informed that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we can calculate the number of girls in the girl scout and subtract it from the total number of girls:

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120
= 80

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we can start by recognizing that the sauce made 32 ounces, which is half the volume of the tomatoes. This implies that the total volume of tomatoes used is twice the volume of the sauce, which is 32 * 2 = 64 ounces.

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total ounces of tomatoes by 16.

64 ÷ 16 = 4 cans

Given that each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by 3.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes."
"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Let's denote the total number of cars as T, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x, and the number of cars that took an exit as e.

Given that T = 30 and e = 5, we can express the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam as x + 20 (since 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes). The total number of cars is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the cars that took an exit.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

T = x + (x + 20) - e

Substituting the given values, we get:

30 = x + (x + 20) - 5

Combine like terms:

30 = 2x + 15

Subtract 15 from both sides:

15 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7.5

Since the number of cars cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a car. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 7.

"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, resulting in a total of:

2 * 40 = 80 potted plants

As she intends to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, the number of plants she will give away is directly proportional to the number of ledges. Therefore, she will give away 40 potted plants.

To find the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants given away from the initial total:

80 - 40 = 40

Thus, Mary will have 40 potted plants remaining.

The sum of pages from all textbooks is 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages. Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

Now, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days he has to complete the reading, which is 4 days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Therefore, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average per day to complete his reading within the given timeframe."
"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of glasses John drinks on weekdays. Since he consumes 1 glass of water for each of the three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and there are 5 weekdays, the total number of glasses consumed on weekdays is 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we consider the weekend days. On weekends, John drinks 1 glass of water for breakfast and 1 glass before bedtime, resulting in a total of 2 glasses per day. With 2 weekend days, the total number of glasses consumed on weekends is 2 * 2 = 4.

To find the total number of glasses John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can apply the concept of uniform motion. Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city by dividing the total distance by the rate of coverage.

Let's denote the total distance as d (in miles) and the rate of coverage as r (in miles per minute). We are given that r = 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles/minute.

We can set up a proportion to relate the total distance to the rate of coverage:

d / 10 minutes = 3 miles / 10 minutes

Since we want to find the time it takes to cover the entire city, we can rearrange the equation to solve for d:

d = 3 miles

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Total distance / Rate
Time = d / r
Time = 3 miles / 0.3 miles/minute
Time = 10 minutes

Therefore, it will take 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Final answer: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board, which is a quarter of the total pieces: $\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250$ pieces.

Next, we find the remaining pieces by subtracting the pieces placed by Poppy from the total: $1000 - 250 = 750$ pieces.

Then, we calculate the number of pieces her mom places on the board, which is a third of the remaining pieces: $\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250$ pieces.

Finally, we determine the number of pieces left by subtracting the pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces: $750 - 250 = 500$ pieces.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1. Since Amir consumes 5 cookies, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption by multiplying Amir's consumption by 3, resulting in 3 × 5 = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies consumed by both individuals, we can add their respective consumptions: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we must first calculate the inner dimensions of each box by subtracting the wall thickness from the outer dimensions.

The outer dimensions of the box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the wall thickness is 1 inch. Therefore, the inner dimensions are:

Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the box) is calculated using the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Substituting the inner dimensions, we get:

V = lwh = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are three identical boxes, the total inner volume is:

Total Volume = 3 x 24 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can first calculate the total time spent watching TV on other days. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, adding another 2 hours to the total.

The total time spent watching TV on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To convert 1.5 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, resulting in 90 minutes.

Now, we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes. This yields 3 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. This year, he aims to bake twice as many cookies, resulting in 2x cookies. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than intended, leading to a total of 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies.

We are given that the total number of cookies Henry has now is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides yields:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 50

Thus, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to determine the total cost of the gas by multiplying the number of gallons purchased by the price per gallon. In this case, the total cost of the gas is:

Total Cost = Number of Gallons * Price per Gallon
Total Cost = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total Cost = $30.00

Next, we need to calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the number of gallons purchased by the cashback amount per gallon. The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon.

Cashback Amount = Number of Gallons * Cashback per Gallon
Cashback Amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback Amount = $2.00

Finally, we can determine the total cost after the cashback rewards by subtracting the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas.

Total Cost after Cashback = Total Cost - Cashback Amount
Total Cost after Cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total Cost after Cashback = $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups each individual consumed. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 (width) * 24 (length) = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 (width) * 14 (length) = 42

The total number of roll-ups is the sum of their individual amounts: 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45.

Final answer: $\boxed{45}$"
"To determine the total amount of water taken on by the boat, we can employ the concept of related rates and the chain rule from calculus. 

Let's denote the distance Julia rows as $s$ (in feet), the time she spends rowing as $t$ (in seconds), and the volume of water taken on as $V$ (in liters). We are given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so the rate of water intake is $\frac{2}{10} = 0.2$ liters per foot. 

We can express the rate of change of water intake with respect to time as $\frac{dV}{dt} = 0.2 \frac{ds}{dt}$. 

We are also given that Julia rows at a constant rate of 1.25 feet per second, so $\frac{ds}{dt} = 1.25$ feet/second. 

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $\frac{dV}{dt} = 0.2 \cdot 1.25 = 0.25$ liters/second.

Now, we can find the total time Julia spends rowing to reach the shore, which is given as 64 seconds. We can use the equation $s = \frac{ds}{dt} \cdot t$ to find the distance she rows:

$s = 1.25 \cdot 64 = 80$ feet.

Finally, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat by integrating the rate of water intake with respect to time:

$V = \int_{0}^{64} \frac{dV}{dt} dt = \int_{0}^{64} 0.25 dt = 0.25 \cdot 64 = 16$ liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can apply the principle of multiplication. Given that each teacher uses the whiteboard twice a day and the whiteboard is cleaned three times per lesson, we can calculate the total number of cleanings as follows:

Total number of cleanings per day = Number of teachers × Number of lessons per day × Number of cleanings per lesson
= 4 × 2 × 3
= 24

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To determine the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Since Ryan plants 2 flowers per day, the total number of flowers can be calculated using the formula for linear growth:

Total flowers = (number of flowers planted per day) * (number of days)

In this scenario, the number of flowers planted per day is 2, and the number of days is 15. Therefore, the total number of flowers can be calculated as:

Total flowers = 2 * 15
Total flowers = 30

However, we are also informed that 5 flowers did not grow. To account for this, we need to subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total:

Total flowers = 30 - 5
Total flowers = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can start by establishing the relationship between the capacities of Jamal's and Brittany's phones. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can express this as:

B = 1/6 * D

We are also given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:

B = 50D

Now, we can equate the two expressions for B:

1/6 * D = 50D

To solve for D, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

D = 300

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. The cost per board is $10, and there are 10 boards, so the total cost is:

10 × $10 = $100

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The cost per board is $16, and there are 5 boards, so the total cost is:

5 × $16 = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards:

$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 × 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 × 1.5 = $24 each.

We calculate the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:

10 × $15 = $150

We calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:

5 × $24 = $120

Now, we add the total revenue from both types of boards:

$150 + $120 = $270

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can apply the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, indicating that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, 13 cups of water are used. 

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, we can set up a proportion to find the value of 'x'. 

The ratio of sugar to total parts is 7:20, and the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the following proportion:

7/20 = 120/x

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

7x = 20 * 120
7x = 2400

Now, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 2400 / 7
x = 342.86 (approximately)

Therefore, Katy used approximately 342.86 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{343}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the shoes, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that John purchases 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, and each pair costs $60, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Total Cost = Number of Pairs per Child * Number of Children * Cost per Pair
Total Cost = 2 * 3 * $60

Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the expression to simplify the calculation:

Total Cost = 2 * (3 * $60)
Total Cost = 2 * $180
Total Cost = $360

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes."
"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles on the second day can be represented as 5x.

We are given that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

5x = 30

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 30 / 5
x = 6

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating Adrien's current salary and Lylah's current salary, and then summing their current salaries.

First, we calculate Adrien's current salary. Given that his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can express this as:

Adrien's current salary = Adrien's old salary + 0.3 * Adrien's old salary
= $40000 + 0.3 * $40000
= $40000 + $12000
= $52000

Next, we calculate Lylah's current salary. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
= $30769.23

Now, we calculate Lylah's current salary by adding 40% of her old salary to her old salary:

40% of $30769.23 = 0.4 * $30769.23
= $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69
= $43077.92

Finally, we sum Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries to find the total salary:

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
= $52000 + $43077.92
= $95077.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95077.92."
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the weekly usage of paper, which is given as 2 pads per week. Since there are 30 sheets in a pad, we can calculate the total sheets used per week as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month, which is typically 4 weeks. This yields:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we can analyze their individual contributions.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, resulting in a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 × 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 ÷ 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

The combined total is the sum of their individual contributions: 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

Therefore, the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought is 27.

Final Answer: The final answer is 27."
"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep patterns into individual days and calculate the cumulative total.

Let's denote the hours slept on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, Thursday as Th, Friday as F, Saturday as Sa, and Sunday as Su. We are given the following information:

M = 8
T = M - 2
W = T - 2
Th = W + 1
F = Th + 1
Sa = F + 1
Su = Sa + 1

We can express these relationships in a table for clarity:

| Day | Hours Slept |
| --- | --- |
| M | 8 |
| T | 8 - 2 = 6 |
| W | 6 - 2 = 4 |
| Th | 4 + 1 = 5 |
| F | 5 + 1 = 6 |
| Sa | 6 + 1 = 7 |
| Su | 7 + 1 = 8 |

Now, we can calculate the total hours slept by summing the hours for each day:

Total hours = M + T + W + Th + F + Sa + Su
= 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 40

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 40 hours throughout the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we can employ the concept of linear motion and calculate the distance covered in two distinct segments.

Let's denote the time Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour as t1 and the time she runs at 5 miles per hour as t2. We are given that t1 = 3 hours. The total time is 7 hours, so t2 = 7 - t1 = 7 - 3 = 4 hours.

The distance covered in the first segment (t1) can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 30 miles

The distance covered in the second segment (t2) can be calculated using the same formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
= 20 miles

The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in the two segments:

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2
= 30 miles + 20 miles
= 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile as x. Since Jennie stamped one-third of the letters needing stamps, the number of letters stamped is 60/3 = 20. The remaining letters, which are already stamped, can be represented as x - 20.

We are given that the current number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30 + 20
x = 50

Thus, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia initially purchased, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package as x. We know that Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. Therefore, the total number of spoons she had at the end is given by the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides yields:

x = 10

Thus, the package that Julia initially purchased contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of fish sausages as 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. This can be represented algebraically as:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6

Given that the number of chicken sausages is 38, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, we can calculate the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let's denote the number of friends Lily has as L and the number of friends Amy has as A. We are given that A = L + 20. We also know that L = 50.

Substituting the value of L into the equation A = L + 20, we get A = 50 + 20 = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: A + L = 70 + 50 = 120.

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"To determine the total cost of the items Dillon is purchasing, we can break down the costs of each item and calculate the total expenditure.

Given that a pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon as 3 times the cost of a pepper: 3 * $15 = $45. 

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:

- 4 watermelons: 4 * $45 = $180
- 20 peppers: 20 * $15 = $300
- 10 oranges: 10 * $40 = $400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments, as well as the costs associated with the doctors' fees.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total time spent on patients:
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Converting the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

2. Calculate the total revenue generated from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

3. Calculate the total revenue generated from the doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

4. Since there is no explicit mention of any hospital costs, we can assume that the hospital's profit is solely derived from the difference between the total revenue and the total revenue generated from the patients (as the hospital's costs are not provided).

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Revenue from Patients
Profit = $30,000 - $100,000
Profit = -$70,000

However, since the question asks for the profit, and the calculated value is negative, it indicates that the hospital is operating at a loss. This is because the hospital's revenue from the patients' payments exceeds the revenue generated from the doctors' fees.

The correct answer is: $0 is not correct, the correct answer is -$70,000"
"To determine the number of elves left, we can employ a straightforward approach by applying the principles of set theory. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves. A third of these elves quit due to the unpleasant incident, which can be represented as:

60 - (1/3) * 60 = 60 - 20 = 40

This leaves 40 elves. However, 10 more elves quit due to the subsequent incident. To find the number of elves remaining, we subtract these 10 from the previous total:

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, the number of elves left is 30."
"To determine the total expenditure for the two months, we can calculate the difference in expenditure between May and June, and then add the expenditure in May.

The expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less, which can be represented as $500 - $60. 

Total expenditure = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June
= $500 + ($500 - $60)
= $500 + $440
= $940

Therefore, the total expenditure for the two months is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets used, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of rides and then multiplying it by the cost per ride.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, resulting in a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, adding up to 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Combining their individual totals, we get 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used can be calculated as 10 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is 60."

x = 3B - 5

We are also provided with the information that Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. Therefore, we can update Brian's video game count to 20 - 5 = 15.

Now, we can substitute B = 15 into the equation:

x = 3(15) - 5
x = 45 - 5
x = 40

Thus, Bobby has 40 video games.

The final answer is 40."

Let's denote the total number of unicorns as T. Since one third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is T/3. We are told that two thirds of these are female, so the number of female Scottish unicorns is (2/3) * (T/3).

Now, we are given that T = 27. Substituting this value into our expression, we get:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * (27/3) = (2/3) * 9 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we can break down the components and apply the relevant mathematical operations.

First, we calculate the subtotal of the order by summing the costs of the individual items: 2 subs at $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each, and 2 cookies at $1.00 each.

Subtotal = (2 x $7.50) + (2 x $1.50) + (2 x $1.00)
Subtotal = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00
Subtotal = $20.00

Next, we calculate the delivery fee, which is 20% of the subtotal.

Delivery Fee = 0.20 x $20.00
Delivery Fee = $4.00

Finally, we add the delivery fee to the subtotal and the $5.00 tip to obtain the total cost.

Total Cost = Subtotal + Delivery Fee + Tip
Total Cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00
Total Cost = $29.00

The final answer is: $29.00"

Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours in the first test, resulting in a total of 5 * 8 = 40 questions completed. Similarly, he completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours in the second test, resulting in a total of 5 * 6 = 30 questions completed.

The total number of questions Mark completed is 40 + 30 = 70. Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions left incomplete is 75 - 70 = 5.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of pink gumballs, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This relationship can be expressed as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that the number of blue gumballs is 12. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given that B = 2Q and W = 2B. The total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:

Q + B + W = 700

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation, we get:

Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700

Combine like terms:

Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees:

W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 2(2*100) = 400

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine Jordan's potential earnings if he were to utilize his video game time for a part-time job, we must first calculate the total hours he would work in a week. Given that he dedicates 2 hours daily to video games, his weekly work hours can be calculated as follows:

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

As Jordan earns $10 per hour, his total weekly earnings can be computed by multiplying his hourly wage by the total hours worked:

$10/hour * 14 hours/week = $140/week

Therefore, if Jordan were to substitute his video game time with a part-time job, he would earn $140 per week.

Final answer: $140"
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items.

First, we calculate the total cost of non-food items: $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Next, we apply the tax rate to the total cost of non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1.

The total cost of non-food items with tax is $10 + $1 = $11.

The total cost of food items is $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is $11 (non-food items with tax) + $5 (food items) = $16.

The final answer is: $16"
"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine the total expenses and subtract them from his total income. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials required for 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

Total cost of bleach = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 clients * 1 pack/client * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Given that Kim's total income is $92, we can calculate his weekly profit as follows:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field with 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year by multiplying the area in hectares by the yield per hectare and then accounting for the frequency of harvesting.

The total number of pineapples per year can be calculated as follows:

Total pineapples per year = (10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare) * 4 (quarters in a year)

Total pineapples per year = 10 * 100 * 4
Total pineapples per year = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces in the second box, which is three times the number of pieces in the first box: 3 * 500 = 1500.

Next, we calculate the number of pieces in the third box, which is one-fourth the number of pieces in the first box: 1/4 * 500 = 125.

Now, we add the number of pieces in each box to find the total: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct phases and utilize basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. In the subsequent 6 hours, half of these bees return, which equates to 15 bees. This accounts for a total of 30 + 15 = 45 bees that have either left or returned by the end of the second 6-hour period.

In the next 6 hours, twice the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours depart, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. Therefore, the total number of bees that have left the hive by the end of the third 6-hour period is 45 + 60 = 105 bees.

Since 15 bees had already returned by the end of the second 6-hour period, the remaining bees that left in the first two 6-hour periods are 105 - 15 = 90 bees. These bees will return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Thus, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the cost of an adult ticket as A and the cost of a child ticket as C. We are given that A = $12 and C = $10. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost can be expressed as A + C.

Given that the total cost is $22, we can set up the equation:
A + C = 22

Substituting the given values for A and C, we get:
$12 + $10 = $22

To find the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the total cost to the change she received. The change is $8, so the total amount given is:
Total Amount = Total Cost + Change
= $22 + $8
= $30

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of friends Charlie and Dorothy have. 

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'D'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this relationship as:

Charlie's friends = 3D

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 3D

To solve for D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, as James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4D
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each individual to cover the distance between their residence and the school.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit. We'll use feet, as the speeds are given in feet per minute. Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet. Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to cover the distance:

Steve's time = Distance / Speed = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time = Distance / Speed = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the time Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. This is equivalent to the difference between their times:

Time Tim will wait = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The number of tires inflated can be calculated by summing the number of tires on bicycles, tricycles, and unicycles. 

Let's break it down:
- Bicycles: 5 bicycles * 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
- Tricycles: 3 tricycles * 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
- Unicycle: 1 unicycle * 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire

Total number of tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total amount of money made can be calculated as follows:
Total amount = Total number of tires * Cost per tire
Total amount = 20 tires * $0.25 per tire
Total amount = $5

Therefore, Shawnda made $5 that day."
"To determine the change Carl receives after purchasing 10 packs of cookies, we can employ the concept of unitary arithmetic. Each pack contains 6 cookies, and the cost of each cookie is $0.10. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then by the cost per cookie:

Total cost = (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack) * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the $10 bill:

Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and algebraic manipulations.

Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as 'x'. We can then track the sequence of events:

1. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull's action is x - 7.
2. Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries consumed. The remaining fries after the pigeons' action is (x - 7) - 9 = x - 16.
3. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which can be expressed as (2/3)(x - 16). The remaining fries after the raccoon's action is (x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16).
4. Simplifying the expression, we get (x - 16) - (2/3)(x - 16) = (1/3)(x - 16).
5. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This can be represented as (1/3)(x - 16) - 1 = 5.
6. Solving for x, we have (1/3)(x - 16) = 6, which simplifies to x - 16 = 18. Adding 16 to both sides yields x = 34.

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total hours spent on each type of day and then summing them up.

Let's break down Kimo's class schedule:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.

Given that there are 16 weeks in a semester, we can calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes by multiplying the weekly hours by the number of weeks: 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we can calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together. 

First, we need to convert the length of the rolls from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can convert the length of the rolls as follows:

300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, we can calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:

120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Finally, we can calculate the length of the baguettes, which are already in feet:

60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we can add the lengths of all the baked goods together:

10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 140 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we must consider the monthly consumption of each primate species. The zookeeper's order should account for the combined demand of the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons.

Let's calculate the total monthly consumption:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas

Total monthly consumption = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total consumption for 2 months:
Total consumption for 2 months = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. This can be achieved by considering the total distance covered by each individual.

Blake's distance can be calculated as 2 * 15 * 100 yards, since he runs back and forth 15 times. This simplifies to 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated as 2 * 100 yards (for the initial back-and-forth run) plus 2 * 40 yards (for the runs to the 40-yard line and back) multiplied by 34 times. This simplifies to 200 + 2 * 40 * 34 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Since 2920 yards is less than 3000 yards, Blake wins.

To find out how much farther Blake ran than Kelly, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

The final answer is: 80"

"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can analyze the information provided and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of starfish caught by Anakin as S, the number of sea horses as H, and the number of clownfish as C. We are given the following information:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish (S = 10)
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught S - 5 starfish (S - 5)
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses (H = 6)
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught H - 3 sea horses (H - 3)
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish (C = 3)
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught C + 2 clownfish (C + 2)

We can now calculate the total number of fish caught by each person and then add them together.

Anakin's total: S + H + C = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: (S - 5) + (H - 3) + (C + 2) = (10 - 5) + 6 - 3 + 3 + 2 = 12

The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is the sum of their individual totals: 19 + 12 = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase using a geometric progression. The initial price is $20, and the common ratio is 1.20 (100% + 20% increase).

The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is:

an = ar^(n-1)

where a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, a = $20, r = 1.20, and n = 36.

an = 20(1.20)^(36-1)
an = 20(1.20)^35
an ≈ 20(5.059)
an ≈ $100.98

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

S_36 = 20 * ((1.20)^36 - 1) / (1.20 - 1)
S_36 ≈ 20 * (5.059 - 1) / 0.20
S_36 ≈ 20 * 4.059 / 0.20
S_36 ≈ 20 * 20.295
S_36 ≈ $403.90

However, the more accurate method to calculate the price after 36 months is to use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $403.90.

The final answer is $403.90."
"To determine the total value of the toys, we can establish a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. D = 3A (The doll costs as much as 3 action figures)
2. R = $4 (One red car costs $4)
3. A = $5 (The cost of an action figure is $5)

We can use substitution to solve for D:
D = 3A
D = 3($5)
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * R) + (3 action figures * A) + (1 doll * D)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + ($15)
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial impact of hiring an accountant versus doing taxes oneself, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Assuming Jackie's lost income from doing her taxes herself is solely due to the 3 hours of freelance work she foregoes, we can calculate the lost income as follows:

Lost income = Number of hours foregone × Hourly wage
Lost income = 3 hours × $35/hour
Lost income = $105

Now, let's consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is a fixed amount of $90.

To find the net gain from hiring an accountant, we subtract the cost from the lost income:

Net gain = Lost income - Cost of hiring an accountant
Net gain = $105 - $90
Net gain = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of computer + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1423

Given that Elvira's budget is €1500, we can calculate the remaining amount for her clothing by subtracting the total cost from her budget:

Remaining amount = Budget - Total cost
Remaining amount = €1500 - €1423
Remaining amount = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the relationship between Seth's and Brooke's ages. Let's denote Seth's current age as x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age can be represented as x/2.

In two years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in two years is given as 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides yields:

3x/2 = 24

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

3x = 48

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

The final answer is $18."
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's break down the problem into two components: weekdays and weekends. Pancho walks 20 miles per day on weekdays, which consist of 5 days. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays can be calculated as:

5 days/week * 20 miles/day = 100 miles/week

On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day, and there are 2 days in a weekend. Thus, the total miles walked on weekends can be calculated as:

2 days/week * 10 miles/day = 20 miles/week

Now, we can find the total miles walked in a week by adding the miles walked on weekdays and weekends:

Total miles/week = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends
Total miles/week = 100 miles/week + 20 miles/week
Total miles/week = 120 miles/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we can break down the costs as follows:

Let's denote the cost of the hat as H, the cost of the jacket as J, and the cost of the pants as P. We are given that H = $25, J = 3H, and P = (H + J) / 2.

Substituting the value of J into the equation for P, we get P = (H + 3H) / 2 = (4H) / 2 = 2H.

Now, we can express the total cost of the uniform as the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants: Total Cost = H + J + P.

Substituting the values of H and P in terms of J, we get Total Cost = H + J + 2H = 3H + J.

Since J = 3H, we can substitute this into the equation for Total Cost: Total Cost = 3H + 3H = 6H.

Substituting the value of H, we get Total Cost = 6($25) = $150.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

The final answer is: $150"

- Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
- Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

To find the total number of legs, we add these values together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1210}$"
"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information using a system of linear equations.

Let's denote the ages of Sally Two, Sally Four, Granny Red, and Sally Thirty-two as S2, S4, GR, and S32, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. S32 = 8
2. S4 = S32
3. GR = 2 * S4
4. S2 = GR + 3

From equation (1) and (2), we can conclude that S4 = 8.

Using equation (3), we can find GR = 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, substituting S4 into equation (4), we get S2 = 16 + 3 = 19.

The total age of the four birds can be calculated as: S32 + S4 + GR + S2 = 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine Jessica's annual debt payment, we must first calculate her monthly payment, which consists of the sum of the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

Let's denote the minimum payment for each debt as follows:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

The total minimum payment is the sum of these individual payments:
Total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we can calculate this additional amount as follows:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, we add this 50% increase to the total minimum payment to obtain Jessica's new monthly payment:
New monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

To find the annual payment, we multiply the new monthly payment by 12:
Annual payment = $1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time required to peel and cut 60 potatoes, we can employ the concept of total time, which is the sum of the time spent on peeling and cutting each potato. Given that the time to peel a potato is 1.5 minutes and the time to cut a potato is 5 seconds, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes = 1/12 minutes

Total time to prepare one potato = Time to peel + Time to cut
= 1.5 minutes + 1/12 minutes
= 1.5 + 0.0833 minutes
= 1.5833 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total time required to prepare 60 potatoes by multiplying the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes:

Total time = 60 * 1.5833 minutes
= 94.999 minutes

Converting the total time to seconds:
Total time (in seconds) = 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute
= 5699.94 seconds

Therefore, the total time required to peel and cut 60 potatoes is approximately 5699.94 seconds.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"To determine the cost of lemons, we can employ a straightforward approach by analyzing the given information. Let's denote the cost of lemons per gallon as L and the cost of sugar per gallon as S. We are given that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 and $2, respectively. The selling price per glass is $0.50, and they obtain 20 glasses per gallon.

The total revenue per gallon can be calculated as the selling price per glass multiplied by the number of glasses per gallon: 20 * $0.50 = $10. The profit per gallon is given as $25, which is the difference between the revenue and the total cost. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Revenue - Total Cost = Profit
$10 - (L + S) = $25

We are also given that L + S = $5, as the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 and $2, respectively. We can substitute this value into the previous equation:

$10 - (L + $2) = $25
$10 - L = $23
L = $7

The final answer is: $7"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls on the team, we can utilize the principle of set theory. Given that the total number of Asians is 240, and 80 are Japanese, the remaining individuals are Chinese. 

Let's denote the total number of Chinese participants as C. We are also provided with the information that the number of Chinese boys is 60. To find the number of Chinese girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

C = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
C = 240 - 80
C = 160

Now, to find the number of Chinese girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = C - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100."
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after various expenses and donations, we can break down his expenditures into distinct categories and calculate the total amount spent.

Given that Zaid's monthly income is $6000, we can calculate the amount spent on rent as follows:

Rent = (1/4) × $6000 = $1500

Next, we calculate the amount spent on car fuel:

Car Fuel = (1/3) × $6000 = $2000

The total amount spent so far is the sum of rent and car fuel:

Total Spent = $1500 + $2000 = $3500

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after deducting the total spent from the monthly income:

Remaining Amount = $6000 - $3500 = $2500

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:

Donation = (1/2) × $2500 = $1250

The amount left after the donation is:

Amount Left = $2500 - $1250 = $1250

Finally, we subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife:

Amount Left = $1250 - ($200 + $700) = $1250 - $900 = $350

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can express this as B = 40.

We are also informed that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be represented as M = B - 4.

Furthermore, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10.

Substituting the expression for M into the equation for R, we get R = (B - 4) + 10.

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for R: R = (40 - 4) + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: Total = B + M + R = 40 + (40 - 4) + 46.

Simplifying the expression, we get Total = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can utilize the concept of linear summation. Given that Lloyd earns $10 per hour, we can express his earnings for each week as a product of the hourly wage and the number of hours worked.

Let's denote the hourly wage as $10 and the number of hours worked in each week as 5 and 8, respectively. We can calculate the total earnings for each week as follows:

Earnings for the first week = $10/hour * 5 hours = $50
Earnings for the second week = $10/hour * 8 hours = $80

To find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we can apply the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the addends does not affect the result. Therefore, we can add the earnings for each week as follows:

Total earnings = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week
= $50 + $80
= $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, the remaining fraction of votes represents the proportion of votes the loser received.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

To find the loser's votes, we can subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
= 80 - 60
= 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x and the number of red roses as y. We are given that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, which can be expressed as:

y = 4x

We are also given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which can be expressed as:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we have found the value of x, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of y:

y = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine Jean's age, we can analyze the given information using a system of linear equations. Let's denote Jean's current age as J and Mark's current age as M.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. J = M + 2 (Jean is two years older than Mark)
2. (M - 2) = (1/2)(30 - 2) + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age)

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5
M - 2 = 19
M = 21

Now that we have Mark's age, we can substitute it into the first equation to find Jean's age:

J = M + 2
J = 21 + 2
J = 23

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can calculate the total time taken by each team.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 seconds per runner, and with four runners, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's time can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Time = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51. 

Time = (4/2) * (60 + 51) 
Time = 2 * 111 
Time = 222 seconds

The time difference between the two teams is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we can utilize the concept of discrete uniform distribution. Given that the die is fair, the probability of rolling any particular number is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the sum of the probabilities of rolling 4, 5, or 6, which is 3/6 or 1/2.

P(X > 3) = 1/2

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we can apply the concept of independent events. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 3/6, assuming the rolls are independent. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

P(2 even numbers in a row) = P(2nd roll is even) * P(1st roll is even) = (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4

Now, we can find the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage:

Difference in probability = P(X > 3) - P(2 even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 = 0.25

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference in probability (%) = 0.25 * 100% = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, the number of apples picked by Jenna is x/2.

The total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is the sum of their individual quantities, which can be represented as:

Total apples = x + x/2

To simplify this expression, we can factor out x:

Total apples = x(1 + 1/2)
Total apples = x(3/2)

We are given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, so we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

Total apples = 20(3/2)
Total apples = 30

Therefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can start by calculating the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

The total straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50, and the total straw used for the rabbits is 20. The total straw used for all the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

18r + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine like terms:

18r + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18r = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 5

Since there are 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 3r = 3 * 5 = 15.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can utilize the formula for simple interest: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and t is the time period in months.

Given that Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can calculate the interest for 3 months as follows:

I = P * r * t
I = $100 * 0.02 * 3
I = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict:

Amount to be paid = P + I
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x. The total cost consists of the cost per bag ($20) and the transportation cost ($2 per bag), so the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost incurred by the three friends, we can break down the expenses into distinct components. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is given as $20.25, and the cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. Therefore, the cost of the food can be calculated as:

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since there are two rides, each costing $33, the total cost of the rides is:

Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

To determine the cost per person, we divide the total cost by 3:

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we can employ the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

First, we convert the time from hours to minutes, as the rate of peach collection is given in peaches per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the time in minutes by the rate of peach collection per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ten ducks, we can employ the concept of weekly consumption and divide it by the number of days in a week. Given that the ducks require 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the daily requirement as follows:

Weekly insect requirement: 3.5 pounds
Number of days in a week: 7

Daily insect requirement = Weekly insect requirement ÷ Number of days in a week
= 3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week
= 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, the ducks in the flock require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to sustain themselves.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

Initially, Tom starts with 50 trees. He plants 10 trees per year, resulting in a total of 100 trees after 10 years. However, he also chops down 2 trees per year, leading to a net gain of 8 trees per year (10 - 2 = 8). 

The total number of trees gained over 10 years is 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees.

Now, 30% of the trees die, which is equivalent to 0.3 * 130 trees = 39 trees. To find the number of trees left, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total:

130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine the number of pink plastic flamingos, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors removed one-third of these flamingos, which equates to 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. Consequently, the remaining number of pink plastic flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 additional pink plastic flamingos were reintroduced to the collection, bringing the total to 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos, which were the result of repainting one-third of the original 18 flamingos, is 18 / 3 = 6.

To calculate the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

The cost of 5 crayons is $10, as calculated by multiplying the number of crayons (5) by the cost per crayon ($2). 

The amount of money Violetta has is $20. 

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has: $20 - $10 = $10.

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change.

The final answer is $10."
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we can utilize the given information to establish a cost relationship between a pen, a pencil, and an eraser. 

Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can express this relationship as:

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser

Substituting the provided values, we have:

Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.50

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, we can multiply the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
Cost of 8 pens = $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed as follows:

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
= 40 * 2
= 80 pounds

Now, we can find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the total amount distributed from the total amount available:

Number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of the complement of a set. The total population of Soda can be represented as the union of the male and female populations, with the remaining individuals belonging to the child population.

P = 23786
M = 8417
F = 9092

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the number of children as:

C = P - (M + F)

C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we can break down the problem into three distinct intervals and calculate the cumulative total.

Let's denote the initial number of cards as x. In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times this amount, which is 3x. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, resulting in 3x - 20 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2(3x + (3x - 20)).

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has after the three months:

Total = Initial cards + Cards collected in the first month + Cards collected in the second month + Cards collected in the third month
Total = x + 3x + (3x - 20) + 2(3x + (3x - 20))
Total = x + 3x + 3x - 20 + 6x - 40
Total = 13x - 60

We are given that Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Total = 13(20) - 60
Total = 260 - 60
Total = 200

Therefore, Elaine now has 200 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"In this problem, we are dealing with a simple linear programming scenario, where Mark's earnings are a function of the number of sentences he edits for each publisher and the respective rates paid by each publisher. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can denote this number as x. Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can express the earnings from each publisher as follows:

Earnings from Publisher A = 5x (5 cents per sentence)
Earnings from Publisher B = 10x (10 cents per sentence)

The total number of sentences Mark edits is 1000, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher:

Earnings from Publisher A = 5x = 5(500) = 2500 cents
Earnings from Publisher B = 10x = 10(500) = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers:

Total Earnings = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"

First, we calculate the morning and afternoon water intake separately. 

Morning water intake: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon water intake: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total daily water intake: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur receives 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we can employ the concept of compound interest, as the 5% raise is an annual increase in his salary. 

First, we need to calculate his earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 per week, we can calculate his annual salary as follows:

Annual salary = Weekly salary * 52 weeks
Annual salary = $2000 * 52
Annual salary = $104,000

Next, we can calculate the 5% raise on his annual salary:

Raise amount = 5% of $104,000
Raise amount = 0.05 * $104,000
Raise amount = $5,200

Now, we can add the award amount to his annual salary to find his total earnings for the year:

Total earnings = Annual salary + Raise amount
Total earnings = $104,000 + $5,200
Total earnings = $109,200

The final answer is: $109,200"
"In viticulture, the production of wine from grapes is a complex process that involves multiple variables, including grape yield, grape quality, and winemaking techniques. However, when considering the production of wine from a specific crop, we can simplify the calculation by focusing on the yield per acre and the conversion rate to barrels.

Given that each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total wine production as follows:

50 tons/acre * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels/acre

Since Josie's farm spans 10 acres, the total wine production can be calculated by multiplying the yield per acre by the total number of acres:

100 barrels/acre * 10 acres = 1000 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 1000 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption into three categories: lunch, breakfast, and dinner.

Carl's lunch consumption can be calculated as 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. Given that he had 3 omelets, his breakfast cheese consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Carl's dinner consumption is a fixed amount, which is 8 slices of cheese.

The total number of slices of cheese Carl used can be found by adding the slices from each meal: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"

First, we calculate the number of blue pens: 6 bags * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.

Next, we calculate the number of red pens: 2 bags * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of pens of each color: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens.

Therefore, Janet now has a total of 98 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the required score on the sixth test, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the sum of the first five test scores as S5 and the desired average as A. We know that Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, so we'll consider the sum of the remaining scores after removing the lowest score.

Given scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, 86

First, we find the sum of the given scores: 
S5 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we'll assume the lowest score is 71. The sum of the remaining scores is: 
S5 - 71 = 438 - 71 = 367

Now, we can set up an equation to find the required score on the sixth test. Let's denote the required score as x. The total sum of the six test scores should be equal to the desired average multiplied by 6: 
(367 + x) / 6 = 93

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 6: 
367 + x = 93 * 6
367 + x = 558

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 367 from both sides: 
x = 558 - 367
x = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can calculate the total distance covered in each period and then sum them up.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a distance of 25 kilometers per ride. This can be calculated as:

5 rides/week * 4 weeks * 25 kilometers/ride = 500 kilometers

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering a distance of 60 kilometers per ride. This can be calculated as:

2 rides/week * 3 weeks * 60 kilometers/ride = 360 kilometers

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered in both periods:

Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then summing the results.

Let's denote the weight of a chocolate bar as C and the weight of a candied apple as A. We are given that C = 2A and C = 40g. Substituting the value of C in terms of A, we have 40g = 2A, which yields A = 20g.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples. The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25C = 25(40g) = 1000g. The total weight of the candied apples is 80A = 80(20g) = 1600g.

The total weight of the bag of candy is the sum of the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples:
Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought after three days, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on each day: 
- On Monday, she purchased 4 cakes.
- On Tuesday, she bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 × 4 = 12 cakes.
- On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 × 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we can find the total number of cakes by summing the number of cakes bought each day: 
4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after three days is 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'x'. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

20 * 12 * x = 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240x = 4800

Dividing both sides by 240, we obtain:

x = 4800 / 240

x = 20

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can model this as a linear programming problem. Let's denote the number of babysitting sessions as x and the number of lawn mowing sessions as y.

The objective function is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the cost of the jacket and shoes, and the earnings from babysitting and lawn mowing. The cost of the jacket and shoes is $50, and Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs to earn $40 more. The earnings from babysitting are $5x, and the earnings from lawn mowing are $4y.

The objective function can be written as:

Minimize 50 + 40 - 10 + 5x + 4y
= 40 + 5x + 4y

Subject to the constraints:

1. x ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for babysitting sessions)
2. y ≥ 0 (non-negativity constraint for lawn mowing sessions)
3. 5x + 4y ≥ 40 (inequality constraint for the total earnings)

To solve this problem, we can use linear programming techniques. One approach is to graph the constraints and find the feasible region. However, in this case, we can also use the graphical method to find the minimum value of the objective function.

The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at (0, 0), (8, 0), and (10, 0). The minimum value of the objective function occurs at the vertex (8, 0), where x = 8 and y = 0.

Therefore, Sara needs to babysit 8 times to earn $40 and mow the lawn 0 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs per day and white chickens producing 5 eggs per day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the perimeter of the local park, we can employ the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the park is a rectangle with a length of 1.5 miles and a width of 6 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(1.5 + 6)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the perimeter by his speed:

Time = P / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the perimeter of the local park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. According to the problem, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which can be expressed as x + 50. The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

Since we are looking for the number of customers on the third day, we can represent the number of customers on the third day as y. However, we are not given the value of y directly. We can rewrite the equation as:

2x + 50 + y = 500

To find the value of y, we need to determine the value of x. We are given that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 50 = 150

Solving for x, we get:

x = 100

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into the original equation:

2(100) + 50 + y = 500

Simplifying the equation, we get:

200 + 50 + y = 500

Combine like terms:

250 + y = 500

Subtract 250 from both sides:

y = 250

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250.

"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. Therefore, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can express this as an equation: 2x - 16 = 4(y - 16), where y is the current amount of water in the small pool.

We can simplify this equation to 2x - 16 = 4y - 64, and then to 2x - 48 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can express this as an equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation, we get x = y + 16.

Substituting x = y + 16 into the first equation, we get 2(y + 16) - 48 = 4y. Expanding and simplifying, we get 2y + 32 - 48 = 4y, which simplifies to 2y - 16 = 4y. Adding 16 to both sides, we get 2y = 4y. Subtracting 4y from both sides, we get -2y = 0. Dividing both sides by -2, we get y = 0.

However, this solution is not physically meaningful, as the amount of water in the small pool cannot be zero. Let's re-examine our equations.

We can rewrite the first equation as 2x - 48 = 4y. We can also express x in terms of y from the second equation as x = y + 16.

Substituting x = y + 16 into the first equation, we get 2(y + 16) - 48 = 4y. Expanding and simplifying, we get 2y + 32 - 48 = 4y, which simplifies to 2y - 16 = 4y.

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total amount she needs to pay and subtracting the total amount she will pay over the 12-month period.

First, we calculate the additional amount she borrowed, which is 10% of the initial $2000. This can be computed as:

Additional amount = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

The total amount she needs to pay is the sum of the initial amount and the additional amount:

Total amount = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over the 12-month period:

Total amount paid = $165 * 12 = $1980

Now, we can determine the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay:

Remaining balance = Total amount - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.

The final answer is: $220"

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can determine her age in three years as 21 + 3 = 24 years.

Since Harriet's age is half that of Zack's, we can calculate Zack's current age as 2 * 21 = 42 years. Consequently, Zack's age in three years will be 42 + 3 = 45 years.

Similarly, Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet's, so his current age is 3 * 21 = 63 years. Therefore, Adrian's age in three years will be 63 + 3 = 66 years.

The average age of the three individuals in three years can be calculated as the sum of their ages divided by 3:

(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of points Jojo scored as J, Naomi scored as N, Yuri scored as Y, and Brianna scored as B.

We are given the following information:

1. N = 68
2. Y = (1/2)N + 10
3. B = N + 17
4. N + Y + B + J = 251

Substituting the expressions for Y and B into the fourth equation, we get:

N + ((1/2)N + 10) + (N + 17) + J = 251

Combine like terms:

(3/2)N + 27 + J = 251

Substitute N = 68:

(3/2)(68) + 27 + J = 251

42 + 27 + J = 251

69 + J = 251

J = 182

Therefore, Jojo scored 182 points.

First, we calculate the remaining water after Celine used 90 liters from the initial 120 liters.

Remaining water = Initial water - Water used
Remaining water = 120 - 90
Remaining water = 30 liters

Next, we consider the rainwater collection. Since the amount of rainwater is stated to be twice the remaining water, we can express this as:

Rainwater = 2 * Remaining water
Rainwater = 2 * 30
Rainwater = 60 liters

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water to find the current total.

Current water = Remaining water + Rainwater
Current water = 30 + 60
Current water = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums. 

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

The company initially spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. In the second year, they spend a third of this amount, which is calculated as:

$15,000 / 3 = $5,000

To determine the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts spent in each year:

$15,000 (first year) + $5,000 (second year) = $20,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

The final answer is: $20,000"
"To determine the total cost of the rentals, we can apply the concept of linear multiplication to calculate the hourly costs for both Carlos and Benji, and then sum the results.

Let's denote the hourly cost of the canoe as C and the hourly cost of the banana boat raft as R. We are given that C = $30 and R = $18.

The total cost for Carlos can be calculated as 3C, and the total cost for Benji can be calculated as 5R. To find the overall cost, we add these two expressions together:

Total Cost = 3C + 5R
= 3($30) + 5($18)
= $90 + $90
= $180

Therefore, the total cost for both rentals is $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we must consider the time required for each leg of the journey. Given that the bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days, and the return trip by car takes half as many days, we can calculate the car trip duration as 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip is the sum of the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the probability of selecting a water-type Pokémon card from James' collection, we must first calculate the total number of cards and the number of water-type cards.

Initially, James has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type cards, resulting in a total of 90 cards. After losing 8 water-type cards, the number of water-type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32. Subsequently, he acquires 14 grass-type cards, increasing the total number of grass-type cards to 20 + 14 = 34.

The updated total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The probability of selecting a water-type card can be calculated as the ratio of the number of water-type cards to the total number of cards:

P(Water-type) = Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards
= 32 / 96
= 1/3
≈ 0.3333

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(Water-type) ≈ 0.3333 * 100
≈ 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing the principle of additive accumulation. The base burrito costs $6.50, and Chad adds the following items:

1. Extra meat: $2.00
2. Extra cheese: $1.00
3. Avocado: $1.00
4. 2 sauces: 2 x $0.25 = $0.50
5. Upgrade: $3.00

We can express the total cost as the sum of these individual components:

Total Cost = Base Burrito + Extra Meat + Extra Cheese + Avocado + 2 Sauces + Upgrade
Total Cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00
Total Cost = $13.00

However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which reduces the total cost:

Total Cost = $13.00 - $5.00
Total Cost = $8.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $8.00."
"To determine the time required to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can employ the concept of combined work rates. Let's denote Kalinda's rate as K and her mom's rate as M. We are given that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so K = 4. Since her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, we have M = K/2 = 2.

The combined rate at which they work together is the sum of their individual rates, which is K + M = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can use the formula:

Time = Total work / Combined rate

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces/minute

Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

Time = 60 minutes / 60
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm after Ashlyn's initial harvest. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, the remaining watermelons constitute 70% of the total.

Let's calculate the number of watermelons remaining on the farm after the initial harvest:

Remaining watermelons = Total watermelons - Watermelons harvested
= 120 - 36
= 84

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, we can calculate this as:

Watermelons ready for harvest = 3/4 * Remaining watermelons
= 3/4 * 84
= 63

Now, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons:

Watermelons not ready for harvest = Remaining watermelons - Watermelons ready for harvest
= 84 - 63
= 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we can break down the expenses into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated as the number of cars multiplied by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

The tax can be calculated as 10% of the cost of the cars, which is 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees can be calculated as the number of cars multiplied by the registration fee per car: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of these three components: $240,000 (cars) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the fleet of cars is $276,000."
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of shells Robert collects on Monday as R and the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday as K. We are given that R = 20.

Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, we can express this relationship as K = R + 5. Substituting R = 20 into this equation yields K = 20 + 5 = 25.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be represented as K_Tuesday = 2 * K, where K_Tuesday denotes the number of shells collected on Tuesday. Substituting K = 25 into this equation gives K_Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can express this relationship as:

Number of bugs = (1/2) * Number of ants

Substituting the given value for the number of ants (50), we obtain:

Number of bugs = (1/2) * 50
= 25

Now, to find the total number of insects, we can add the number of bugs and ants:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we must first calculate the total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot. One-third of the 36 penguins, which is 36 / 3, equals 12 penguins that jumped into the ocean. Another one-third of the 36 penguins, also 36 / 3, equals 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

The total number of penguins that left their sunbathing spot is the sum of these two groups: 12 + 12 = 24 penguins. 

To find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12 penguins.

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12.

12"
"To determine the number of tomato vines required, we must first establish the total weekly tomato consumption. Given that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and consumes 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his daily consumption as follows:

Steve's daily consumption = 6 tomatoes/day
Girlfriend's daily consumption = 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes/day

Total daily consumption = Steve's daily consumption + Girlfriend's daily consumption
Total daily consumption = 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes/day

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly consumption = 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the number of vines required as follows:

Number of vines = Total weekly consumption / Tomatoes per vine
Number of vines = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine
Number of vines = 21

Therefore, Steve requires 21 tomato vines to meet his weekly consumption needs.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can apply the concept of division to find the minimum number of whole pizzas required to meet the demand. Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we can divide the total number of slices needed (20 friends * 4 slices per friend) by 8.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza
= (20 friends * 4 slices per friend) / 8 slices per pizza
= 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza
= 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order at least 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we can utilize the concept of a linear transformation. Let's denote the number of empty pens as 'x'. Since Ram can create one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 5 empty pens → 1 full pen.

Given that Ram initially has 25 pens, we can calculate the number of full pens he can create by dividing the total number of pens by 5.

x = 25 pens / 5 pens per full pen
x = 5 full pens

Now, we need to add the 5 full pens to the original 25 pens to find the total number of pens Ram can have.

Total pens = 25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens)
Total pens = 25 + 5
Total pens = 30

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. Given that his initial investment of $20 was tripled, we can express this as an exponential function:

A = P(3^t)

where A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial investment), and t is the time period in years.

In this case, P = $20 and t = 1 year. Plugging in these values, we get:

A = 20(3^1)
A = 20(3)
A = 60

Therefore, Johnny had $60 after a year.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as J + 5 - 2. Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages.

Joan's age = J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age = J + 5 - 2 = 20 + 5 - 2 = 23

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = J + (J + 5) + (J + 5 - 2)
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit A, which is 30% of the total number of students. This can be expressed as 0.3 * 1000.

Let's calculate this value: 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students who exited through A from the total number of students to find the remaining students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students. This can be expressed as (3/5) * 700.

Let's calculate this value: (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who exited through B from the remaining students to find the number of students who exited through C: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'r'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2r.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

2r = 54

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

r = 54 ÷ 2
r = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's total:

James' candies = r + 6
= 27 + 6
= 33

To determine how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' total from John's total:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
= 54 - 33
= 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"In this scenario, we can model the situation using a simple combinatorial approach. Let's consider the books as distinct entities. Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. When they read each other's books, the total number of books read can be calculated as follows:

Dolly reads 2 books from her own collection and 1 book from Pandora's collection, resulting in a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books read by Dolly.

Pandora reads 1 book from her own collection and 2 books from Dolly's collection, resulting in a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books read by Pandora.

The total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is the sum of their individual totals, which is 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, the total number of books they will collectively read is 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing per week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he writes 30 pages per week and can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing as follows:

Time spent writing (in minutes) = Total pages written * Time per page
Time spent writing (in minutes) = 30 pages/week * 6 minutes/page
Time spent writing (in minutes) = 180 minutes/week

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we can divide by 60:

Time spent writing (in hours) = Time spent writing (in minutes) / 60
Time spent writing (in hours) = 180 minutes/week / 60
Time spent writing (in hours) = 3 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours per week writing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the remaining minutes in Jason's phone plan, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss, which is 15 minutes per day for 30 days. This can be expressed as:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. Therefore, the total minutes used is the sum of these two:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan to find the remaining minutes:

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach by representing the number of fries each person took as variables. Let's denote the initial number of fries Griffin had as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24
2. K = 5
3. B = 2K
4. C = K - 3
5. G - (K + B + x + C) = 27

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

24 - (5 + 2(5) + x + (5 - 3)) = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - (5 + 10 + x + 2) = 27

Combine like terms:

24 - 17 - x = 27

Simplify further:

7 - x = 27

Subtract 7 from both sides:

-x = 20

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = -20

However, since the number of fries cannot be negative, we re-examine our steps. Let's re-evaluate the equation:

24 - (5 + 10 + x + (5 - 3)) = 27

24 - (5 + 10 + x + 2) = 27

24 - (17 + x) = 27

Subtract 24 from both sides:

- (17 + x) = 3

Subtract 17 from both sides:

-x = -14

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 14

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 14 fries.

Final answer: 14"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since the number of fish in each aquarium is the same, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2 * 14 = 28.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we can employ the concept of total labor hours and apply a discount to the total cost.

First, we calculate the total labor hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Multiplying this by the number of weeks the movie takes to finish (5 weeks) yields a total of 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost without the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to obtain the amount Jean paid: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the various items.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we can divide the total cost by the number of people.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32.

The final answer is $32."
"To determine the total cost of the onions, we can apply the concept of unitary measurement and multiplication. Given that the chef purchased 4 bags of onions, each weighing 50 pounds, and the cost per pound is $1.50, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total weight of onions = Number of bags × Weight per bag
Total weight of onions = 4 × 50 pounds
Total weight of onions = 200 pounds

Total cost = Total weight of onions × Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds × $1.50
Total cost = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions."
"To determine the difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each individual.

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday as S_Monday and the number of cookies eaten by her sister on Monday as S_Sister_Monday. Similarly, we'll denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Tuesday as S_Tuesday and the number of cookies eaten by her sister on Tuesday as S_Sister_Tuesday.

Given that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we can express this relationship as:

S_Monday = 4 * S_Sister_Monday

We are also given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, we can write:

S_Sister_Monday = 5
S_Sister_Tuesday = 13

Substituting the value of S_Sister_Monday into the first equation, we get:

S_Monday = 4 * 5 = 20

Now, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

Calories consumed by Sue = S_Monday * 200 + S_Tuesday * 200
Calories consumed by her sister = S_Sister_Monday * 200 + S_Sister_Tuesday * 200

Substituting the values, we get:

Calories consumed by Sue = 20 * 200 + 26 * 200
Calories consumed by her sister = 5 * 200 + 13 * 200

Simplifying the expressions, we get:

Calories consumed by Sue = 4000 + 5200
Calories consumed by her sister = 1000 + 2600

Now, we can calculate the difference in calorie consumption:

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = Calories consumed by Sue - Calories consumed by her sister
= (4000 + 5200) - (1000 + 2600)
= 9200 - 3600
= 5600

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, we can calculate the total number of students as 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes. 

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of students is 1.5 * 20 = 30 students.

We are also given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school: 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

To find the number of boys in each class, we divide the total number of boys by the number of classes: 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. 

The initial number of apps is 61, and Travis deleted 9 apps. To find the number of apps remaining after deletion, we subtract 9 from 61:

61 - 9 = 52

Next, Travis downloaded 18 more apps. To find the total number of apps now, we add 18 to the result:

52 + 18 = 70

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70.

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W1 and the number of cougars killed last night as C1. We are given that W1 = 10 and C1 = 15.

We are also given that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today (W2) is 3 times the number of cougars killed today (C2). We can express this as W2 = 3C2.

Additionally, we know that the number of cougars killed today (C2) is three fewer than the number of cougars killed last night (C1), so C2 = C1 - 3.

We can now substitute the value of C1 into the equation for C2: C2 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now that we have the value of C2, we can find W2 by multiplying C2 by 3: W2 = 3 * 12 = 36.

Finally, we can find the total number of animals Rick killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed each night: Total = W1 + W2 + C1 + C2 = 10 + 36 + 15 + 12 = 73.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is currently on, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. 

We are given that Bill starts on the 3rd floor and rides the elevator to the floor that is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. This can be mathematically represented as:

Floor = 4 * Starting Floor + 6

Substituting the given starting floor value (3) into the equation:

Floor = 4 * 3 + 6
Floor = 12 + 6
Floor = 18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate 30% of the number of times Mitchel went down the slide, which is 30. This can be expressed as 0.3 * 30. 

0.3 * 30 = 9

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we subtract this value from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total. 

30 - 9 = 21

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. To find Robert's total, we multiply Anne's total by 4.

4 * 21 = 84

Therefore, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas' purchase. Initially, there were 20 cows in each of the 20 stalls, resulting in a total of 20 * 20 = 400 cows. After acquiring 40 additional cows, the total becomes 400 + 40 = 440 cows.

Since the cows are evenly distributed among the 20 stalls, we can calculate the number of cows per stall by dividing the total number of cows by 20: 440 / 20 = 22 cows per stall.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176 cows.

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{176}$"
"To determine the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the value of each type of currency and summing the results.

First, we'll calculate the total value of the coins:

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Next, we'll add the value of the dollar bills: 40 x $1 = $40

Now, we can sum the values of the coins and the dollar bills: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can utilize the formula for total weight, which is the product of the number of sections and the weight per section. 

Let's denote the total height of the redwood as H (in feet) and the weight per section as W (in pounds). We are given that H = 200 feet and W = 400 pounds per 10-foot section. 

The total weight of the redwood can be expressed as:

Total Weight = H * (W / 10)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total Weight = 200 feet * (400 pounds / 10 feet)
Total Weight = 200 * 40 pounds
Total Weight = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate this as:

Weight Eaten by Termites = Total Weight * 0.30
Weight Eaten by Termites = 8000 pounds * 0.30
Weight Eaten by Termites = 2400 pounds

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining wood by subtracting the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight:

Weight of Remaining Wood = Total Weight - Weight Eaten by Termites
Weight of Remaining Wood = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
Weight of Remaining Wood = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To determine the total amount Nancy owes, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The cost of the overdue books can be calculated as the product of the number of books and the per-book fine, which is $0.50. This yields a total of $4.00. Additionally, a flat fee of $2.00 is incurred for having at least one book over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount owed is the sum of these two values.

Total Amount Owed = (Number of Books * Per-Book Fine) + Flat Fee
Total Amount Owed = (8 * $0.50) + $2.00
Total Amount Owed = $4.00 + $2.00
Total Amount Owed = $6.00

The correct answer is: $6.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of apples and bananas each individual has.

Let A be the number of apples Andrea has, and B be the number of bananas Jamal has. We are given the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: A = B + 8
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: A = 0.5B
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: B = A + 4

We can use substitution to solve for B by substituting the first equation into the second equation:
B = 0.5(A - 8)

Now, substitute the expression for B into the third equation:
A = 0.5(A - 8) + 4

Simplify the equation:
A = 0.5A - 4 + 4
A = 0.5A

Subtract 0.5A from both sides:
0.5A = 4

Multiply both sides by 2:
A = 8

Now that we have found A, we can find B by substituting A into one of the original equations:
B = A + 4
B = 8 + 4
B = 12

Now that we have the number of apples and bananas for both individuals, we can find the total number of fruits:
Total = A + B
Total = 8 + 12
Total = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies and then divide by 12, as 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of flour needed:

Total flour = (2 cups / 12 cookies) * 66 cookies

Total flour = (1/6) * 66
Total flour = 11 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of pennies (9,300) by the fraction 2/3.

Let's perform the calculation:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can then multiply the result by this value to obtain the total dollar amount:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ a simple arithmetic operation. 

First, we calculate the initial number of marbles by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles. 

Next, we add the marbles Maddison received from her friend to the initial total: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can employ a systematic approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H. We are provided with the following information:

1. C = 6
2. F = C / 2
3. H = 2F + 5

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for F to find the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard:

F = 6 / 2
F = 3

Next, we can substitute the value of F into the equation for H to find the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H = 2(3) + 5
H = 6 + 5
H = 11

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3
H - F = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. 

Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as C, Samantha has as S, and Daisy has as D. We are given the following information:

1. C = $100
2. S = C + $25
3. D = S + $50

We can substitute the value of S from equation (2) into equation (3) to find D:
D = (C + $25) + $50
D = C + $75

Now, we can substitute the value of C into the equation for D:
D = $100 + $75
D = $175

Next, we can add up the amounts using the values of C, S, and D:
Total = C + S + D
Total = $100 + ($100 + $25) + $175
Total = $100 + $125 + $175
Total = $400

Therefore, the total amount of money the girls have is $400."
"To determine the total price of the house, we must consider the additional fees associated with the purchase. The selling price of the property is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which can be calculated as:

Transfer fee = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

The total additional fees are the sum of the brokerage fee and the transfer fee:

Total additional fees = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

The total price of the house is the sum of the selling price and the total additional fees:

Total price = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:

Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

The selling price of the house is $400,000. Mr. Tan paid a transfer fee of 3% of the selling price, which is $12,000 (0.03 x $400,000). He also paid a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price, which is $20,000 (0.05 x $400,000). Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

The total amount paid by Mr. Tan is the sum of the transfer fee, brokerage fee, and the loan amount: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time elapsed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we must consider the time required for heating the oil and the time needed for cooking the chicken.

The heating process involves two stages: initial heating to 300 degrees and subsequent heating to 400 degrees. The initial heating time is given as 20 minutes. The additional time required to reach 400 degrees is 40% of the initial heating time, which can be calculated as:

Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + 0.4 * 20 minutes
= 20 minutes + 8 minutes
= 28 minutes

The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time can be calculated as:

Time to cook the chicken = 28 minutes - 5 minutes
= 23 minutes

The total time elapsed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time:

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
= 28 minutes + 23 minutes
= 51 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on all ads, we can employ the principle of additive expenditure. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad, and he purchased 50 such ads. The total expenditure on newspaper ads can be calculated as:

Total Newspaper Ad Expenditure = Number of Newspaper Ads * Cost per Ad
= 50 * $5
= $250

Similarly, the agent spent $75 on each television ad, and he purchased 15 such ads. The total expenditure on television ads can be calculated as:

Total Television Ad Expenditure = Number of Television Ads * Cost per Ad
= 15 * $75
= $1125

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the expenditures on newspaper and television ads:

Total Expenditure = Total Newspaper Ad Expenditure + Total Television Ad Expenditure
= $250 + $1125
= $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary obtained, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag:
- The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it contains 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms in each bag to find the total:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

Therefore, Mary obtained a total of 762 M&Ms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{762}$"
"To determine the total number of windows, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of windows in the bedrooms and the number of additional windows.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 3 bedrooms in each of the 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms can be calculated as:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and there are 2 houses. Therefore, the total number of additional windows is:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the overall total:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

"To determine the change the cashier should give the mother, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual item prices: 

$4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $14.99

Since the mother pays $20, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the amount paid:

$20 - $14.99 = $5.01

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $5.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of stitches for the body as B, the number of stitches for the collar as C, and the number of stitches for the rosette as R. We are given that B = 900, C = B/10, and R = 2C.

We can express the total number of stitches for the sweater as the sum of the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: B + C + R = 1800.

Substituting the given values, we get:
900 + (900/10) + 2(900/10) = 1800

Simplifying the equation, we have:
900 + 90 + 180 = 1800

This equation holds true, as 1170 indeed equals 1800.

Now, we can find the number of stitches for the two sleeves by subtracting the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
Sleeves = Total - (B + C + R)
= 1800 - 1170
= 630

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
Sleeves per sleeve = 630 / 2
= 315

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we can employ the principle of arithmetic summation. Given that Mrs. Rylan purchased 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 per packet and 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 per packet, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total Cost = (Number of packets of tomato seeds) × (Cost per packet of tomato seeds) + (Number of packets of celery seeds) × (Cost per packet of celery seeds)
Total Cost = 20 × $40 + 80 × $30
Total Cost = $800 + $2400
Total Cost = $3200

Therefore, the total cost of the seeds is $3200."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into components and apply mathematical operations to derive the solution.

Let's denote the number of lines in the first scene as S1, the number of lines in the second scene as S2, and the number of lines in the song as L. We are given the following information:

1. The song has 54 lines, so L = 54.
2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so S1 = 2L = 2(54) = 108.
3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's, so the number of lines Sean has from the first scene is S1/3 = 108/3 = 36.
4. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so S2 = L + 6 = 54 + 6 = 60.
5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's, so the number of lines Sean has from the second scene is S2 * 4/5 = 60 * 4/5 = 48.

Now, we can calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize by adding the lines from the song and both scenes: L + S1/3 + S2 * 4/5 = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing the principle of set operations.

Initially, we have 80 cards in total. We first identify the number of cards with the letter A, which is 2/5 of 80, or 32 cards.

Next, we subtract the cards with A from the total to obtain the remaining cards: 80 - 32 = 48.

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter B, which is 1/2 of the remaining cards: 1/2 * 48 = 24 cards.

Subtracting the cards with B from the remaining cards yields 48 - 24 = 24 cards.

Now, we find the number of cards with the letter C, which is 5/8 of the remaining cards: 5/8 * 24 = 15 cards.

Finally, we determine the number of cards with the letter D by subtracting the cards with C from the remaining cards: 24 - 15 = 9 cards.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

"To determine the total time required to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's define the time taken for small and large holes as S and L, respectively. We are given that S = 3 minutes and L = 10 minutes.

The total time (T) can be represented as the sum of the time for small holes and large holes, multiplied by their respective quantities:

T = 30S + 15L

Substituting the given values for S and L:

T = 30(3) + 15(10)
T = 90 + 150
T = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

T = 240 minutes / 60
T = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Let's denote Mico's current age as x and Marco's current age as y. We are given that the sum of their current ages is 20, which can be expressed as:

x + y = 20

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10, respectively. The sum of their ages in 10 years can be represented as:

(x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20

Substituting the given equation x + y = 20 into the expression, we obtain:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the given information and derive the value of Sam's current age.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. The problem states that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we obtain:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

"To determine the total number of spots, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of cobras and mambas. Let's denote the number of cobras as C and the number of mambas as M. We are given that C = 40 and M = 60.

Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can express this relationship as:

C = 2M

Substituting the given values, we get:

40 = 2M
M = 40 / 2
M = 20

However, this contradicts the given information that M = 60. Let's re-evaluate the relationship between the number of cobras and mambas. If a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, then the number of cobras should be equal to twice the number of mambas. This implies that the initial statement about the number of mambas being 60 is incorrect.

Assuming the correct relationship is that the number of cobras is twice the number of mambas, we can re-calculate the number of mambas as:

C = 2M
40 = 2M
M = 40 / 2
M = 20

However, this contradicts the given information. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. If a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and there are 70 spots on a cobra, then the number of spots on a mamba is 70 / 2 = 35.

Let's denote the number of cobras as C and the number of mambas as M. We are given that C = 40 and M = 60. The total number of spots is the sum of the spots on cobras and mambas:

Total spots = C * 70 + M * 35
Total spots = 40 * 70 + 60 * 35
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

Half the number of spots is:
Total spots / 2 = 4900 / 2
Total spots / 2 = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of individuals attending the event. This includes the team members, coaches, and their guests. The number of team members is given as 12, and there are 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of individuals is the sum of team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the total number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of individuals by 3: 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas for the soccer game.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length of the gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can calculate the number of beads used by dividing the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch). 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of beads = Total space between gemstones / Length of each bead
= 17 inches / (1/4 inch)
= 17 * 4
= 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the number of stories each child wrote in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's current age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18 years

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21 years

Therefore, the brother's age in 3 years will be 21 years.

Final answer: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we can calculate the total value of her coins and subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x $0.25 = $1.25. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x $0.10 = $0.20. The total value of her coins is $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45.

The can of pop costs $0.55. To find the amount of money Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins:

$1.45 - $0.55 = $0.90

Therefore, Kelly will have $0.90 left.

The final answer is: $0.90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5-star rows on the 76-star flag, we can employ a combinatorial approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows: 3 * 8 + 2 * 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 stars. 

Since the flag has 76 stars, the remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. 

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the remaining stars by 5: 40 / 5 = 8.

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at a constant velocity of 60 miles/hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the time taken by the slow lane car using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the given values, we get:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour

Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as x. We are given that Ali, who has 22 medals, and his friend Izzy, who has 5 fewer medals than Ali, together have a total of 10 times fewer medals than the total number of medals given out.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

22 + (22 - 5) = 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

22 + 17 = 10x

Combining like terms, we have:

39 = 10x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 39 / 10

x = 3.9

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.9}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. With 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Since each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars allocated to adults is 4 * 6 = 24. The remaining chocolate bars are then 40 - 24 = 16.

To distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars among the 8 children, we can use the concept of division. The number of chocolate bars each child will receive is 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings, we can calculate the total minutes she works and then divide that by the interval at which she earns money. 

First, we need to calculate the total minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

Total minutes = (11 hours - 8 hours) * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes (accounting for the half-hour pause)
Total minutes = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes
Total minutes = 180 minutes + 30 minutes
Total minutes = 210 minutes

Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

Earnings = (Total minutes / 10) * $5
Earnings = (210 minutes / 10) * $5
Earnings = 21 * $5
Earnings = $105

The final answer is $105."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Initially, we have the following points for each player:
- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 21 - 3 = 18 points
- Tony: 21 * 2 = 42 points

In the fourth round, each player receives an additional point if their current score exceeds 20 points. Therefore, Mike and Tony receive an extra point, while Jim does not.

The updated scores are:
- Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points

To find the total points, we sum the scores of all three players:
Total points = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. The problem states that Will buys 15 oranges and asks his sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. Given that the oldest son is 8 years old and the youngest is half as old as the oldest, we can calculate the number of oranges each son washes.

The oldest son, being 8 years old, washes 8 oranges. Since the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old, and thus washes 4 oranges.

The total number of oranges washed by the sons is 8 (from the oldest) + 4 (from the youngest) = 12 oranges.

To find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the total number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges purchased: 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has completed over the two days, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20, decreased his squats by 10, and doubled his dumbbell presses.

Let's calculate the number of each activity on both days:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the duration for which a 42 kg bag of rice will last in a household with 5 members consuming rice at 0.2 kg per meal, we must first calculate the total daily rice consumption.

Given that each individual consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal and there are two meals per day, the total daily consumption per person is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg. With 5 members in the household, the total daily consumption is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly consumption is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

To find the number of weeks the rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the weekly consumption (14 kg):

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, the rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of crates Sam fell short of his target, we must first calculate the total number of crates sold during the week. We are given the following information:

- Crates sold on Tuesday: 15
- Crates sold on Wednesday: 12
- Crates sold on Thursday: 18
- Crates sold over the weekend: 20

The total number of crates sold can be calculated as follows:

Total crates sold = Crates sold on Tuesday + Crates sold on Wednesday + Crates sold on Thursday + Crates sold over the weekend
Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20
Total crates sold = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can calculate the difference between the target and the total number of crates sold to determine how many crates he fell short:

Difference = Target - Total crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65
Difference = 55

Therefore, Sam fell 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can model the bidding process as an arithmetic sequence. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. Since there are 3 other bidders, the total number of bids is 4 (including Carmen). 

The sequence of bids can be represented as: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 5 (4 bids + 1 for Carmen's bid), a1 = $200, and an = $400. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 5/2 * ($200 + $400)
S = 2.5 * $600
S = $1500

Therefore, the total cost of the desk is $1500.

The final answer is: $1500"
"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of driving and the bonus paid to the driver.

The cost of driving can be calculated by multiplying the total miles driven per year by the cost per mile. Given that John drives 60 miles per day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back) and works 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

In addition to the cost of driving, John also pays a $150 bonus per month to his driver. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus paid is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Therefore, the total cost of driving per year is $30,000 (cost of driving) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference between his desired exercise time and the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M, the time he exercised on Sunday as S, and the desired time as D. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes. We want to find D.

First, we calculate the combined time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday: M + S = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Since Peter wants to exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, we can express this as D = 2(M + S).

Now, we can substitute the values of M and S into the equation: D = 2(16 + 23) = 2(39) = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"In the context of tabloid production, the number of pieces of paper required can be determined by considering the folding mechanism and the page layout. When a tabloid is folded in half, the pages are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with the first and last pages of each half being on the outside. This results in two distinct sections: the left side and the right side.

Mathematically, if we denote the total number of pages as 'n', the number of pages on each side can be calculated as n/2. In the case of a 32-page tabloid, we have:

n = 32

Number of pages on each side = n/2 = 32/2 = 16

Since each side requires two pieces of paper (one for the left and one for the right), the total number of pieces of paper required is:

Total pieces of paper = 2 * 16 = 32

However, this calculation assumes that the pages are arranged in a simple alternating pattern. In reality, the actual number of pieces of paper required may vary depending on the specific printing layout and design. Nevertheless, for a standard 32-page tabloid, the most straightforward calculation yields:

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Given that she initially brought $50 and spent $25 on food and snacks, and an additional $10 on rides, we can calculate the remaining amount as follows:

Initial amount = $50
Total spent = $25 (on food and snacks) + $10 (on rides) = $35

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total spent
= $50 - $35
= $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can employ a linear programming approach to model the situation. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x and the number of books sold in the current year as y.

We are given that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

We also know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200, so we can set up the equation x + y = 200.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation, we get 2y + y = 200, which simplifies to 3y = 200. Solving for y, we find y = 200/3 ≈ 66.67.

Since we know that Elise sold 45 books in the current year, we can verify that y = 45, which is consistent with our calculation.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year (y) by the price per book (20$). The total amount of money earned in the second year is 45 * 20 = 900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we can employ the concept of total weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the month. Given that Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week, and earns $10 per hour, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly earnings = (10 hours/day * 5 days/week) * $10/hour = $500/week

Since April has 30 days, we can calculate the total earnings for the month by multiplying the weekly earnings by the number of weeks in April:

Total earnings = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks in April
= $500/week * (30 days / 7 days/week)
= $500/week * 4.29 weeks
= $2145

Additionally, Watson receives a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be:

Total earnings = $2145 + $300
= $2445

The final answer is: $2445"
"In this scenario, we can model the situation using a simple probability problem. John arm-wrestled 20 people, and he won 80% of the time. To find the number of people he lost to, we can calculate the number of people he lost as follows:

Number of people John lost to = Total number of people - Number of people John won to
= 20 - (20 x 0.8)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning, which is two-thirds of the total daily production. This can be expressed as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Next, we find the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales by subtracting the morning sales from the total daily production:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon as follows:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can apply the concept of proportional weight loss. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weekly weight loss rate as follows:

Weekly weight loss rate = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 2 pounds/week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 8/2
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To determine the total savings, we can calculate the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at the original price, and then subtract the total cost at the discounted price.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated as the difference between the total original cost and the total discounted cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs caused by the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. The serum induces the growth of an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. We can model this situation using a system of linear congruences.

Let's define the number of days as 't'. The number of extra arms grown can be represented as t mod 3, and the number of extra legs grown can be represented as t mod 5. We are interested in finding the total number of new limbs after 15 days, which is equivalent to finding the value of (t mod 3) + (t mod 5) for t = 15.

We can simplify this expression by evaluating the individual congruences:

(t mod 3) = 15 mod 3 = 0
(t mod 5) = 15 mod 5 = 0

Since both expressions evaluate to 0, the total number of new limbs is 0 + 0 = 0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total cost of his trip expenses. 

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of items purchased so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption of the family. Three individuals consume 3 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day. The remaining two individuals consume 2 eggs each day, contributing a total of 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The combined daily egg consumption is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, as there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. Based on the given information:

1. Q = 30
2. J = Q - 3
3. T = J + 5

Substituting the value of Q into equation (2), we get:
J = 30 - 3
J = 27

Now, substituting the value of J into equation (3), we get:
T = 27 + 5
T = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information and applying basic algebraic manipulations.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. According to the problem statement, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46 years old. Therefore, we can express Noah's current age as:

N = 46 + 6
N = 52

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since the population six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2)P = 3000N

Substituting the value of N into the equation, we get:

(1/2)P = 3000(52)
(1/2)P = 156,000

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

P = 156,000 × 2
P = 312,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 312,000.

The final answer is: 312,000"
"To determine the number of players on the defense, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which equals 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 4x + x = 210

Combining like terms, we get:

7x = 210

Dividing both sides by 7, we obtain:

x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to consider the total number of people invited and the number of individuals who are unable to attend due to illness and prior commitments.

First, we calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, resulting in 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, yielding 3 x 4 = 12 people. Therefore, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Next, we account for the individuals who are unable to attend due to illness. 8 people are unable to attend, leaving 24 - 8 = 16 people.

We also need to consider the individuals who had prior commitments. 1/4 of 8 people had prior commitments, which is equivalent to 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the individuals with prior commitments from the total number of people who were initially invited: 24 - 2 = 22.

However, we must note that the 8 people who were unable to attend due to illness are not included in the 22 individuals. Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. We know that Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

Let's calculate 2/5 of 20:
(2/5) * 20 = (2 * 20) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8

So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. The total number of marbles Solomon has in the store is the sum of the marbles he bought, the marbles his father gave him, and the marbles already present in the store:
Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) + 50 (in the store) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we can calculate the total weight by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool (l = 6 ft, w = 4 ft, h = 5 ft), we can substitute these values into the formula:

V = (6 ft) × (4 ft) × (5 ft)
V = 120 cubic feet

Since the cost is $0.1 per cubic foot, the total cost to fill the pool can be calculated as:

Total Cost = V × Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet × $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is $12.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can express this relationship as G = 3B. Additionally, we know that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which can be represented as N = (1/10)B.

We are also given that the number of boys is 30, so B = 30. Substituting this value into the equation G = 3B, we find that G = 3(30) = 90.

Now, we can calculate the number of nongendered children by substituting B = 30 into the equation N = (1/10)B, yielding N = (1/10)(30) = 3.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of ratios and proportions. Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can express this relationship as a fraction, where the number of poles is 1 part and the number of wires is 3 parts.

Let's denote the number of poles as 'x'. Since the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3, the total number of parts is 1 + 3 = 4. We are given that the total number of electric wires is 45. To find the value of 'x', we can set up a proportion:

1/3 = x/45

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

1 × 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Next, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate 'x':

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party, totaling 40 individuals. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who departed as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

Given that 22 men remained at the party, we can deduce that 3 men left. This implies that the remaining 10 individuals who left must have been women, as the total number of people who left is 10.

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = Initial number of women - Number of women who left
= 15 - 10
= 5

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P.

Given that the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can express this relationship as:

M = 0.5B

Since the book costs $4, we can substitute this value into the equation:

M = 0.5(4)
M = 2

Now, we are told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

P = M - 1

Substituting the value of M into this equation, we get:

P = 2 - 1
P = 1

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of boxes required to store the pencils, we can start by calculating the total number of pencils Jam and her sister Meg have. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils she has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we must consider the combined effects of cooling and dilution. The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, resulting in a 5-unit decrease in temperature (65 / 13 = 5). This corresponds to the addition of 5 ice cubes, each contributing a 12-milliliter decrease in coffee strength.

The total weakening due to cooling is therefore 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Additionally, the 15 milliliters of cream added to the coffee also contributes to its weakening. The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of these two effects: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as x. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x. Since 5 people traded their old records, the total number of old records traded is 2x.

We are given that the 5 people left with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is also 5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 5/2

x = 2.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a record, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot trade a fraction of a record. However, in this case, the problem statement does not explicitly state that we should round down, so we will leave the answer as a fraction.

x = 5/2

x = 2.5"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of junior and senior programmers, and then calculating their respective salaries.

Let's denote the total number of employees as N. We are given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of N, so the number of junior programmers is (2/5)N. Since the total number of employees is 100, we can set up the equation:

(2/5)N + N = 100

To solve for N, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:

2N + 5N = 500

Combine like terms:

7N = 500

Divide both sides by 7:

N = 500/7
N = 71.43 (round to 2 decimal places)

Now that we have the total number of employees, we can calculate the number of junior and senior programmers. The number of junior programmers is (2/5)N = (2/5)(71.43) = 28.57 (round to 2 decimal places). Since the number of junior programmers must be a whole number, we can round down to 28.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is N - 28 = 71.43 - 28 = 43.43 (round to 2 decimal places). Since the number of senior programmers must be a whole number, we can round down to 43.

The salary of a junior programmer is $2000, and the salary of a senior programmer is $2400. The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 28 * $2000 = $56,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 43 * $2400 = $103,200.

The total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month is $56,000 + $103,200 = $159,200.

The final answer is: $159,200"
"To determine the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. Additionally, 8 people got on at the second stop. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is x + 5 + 8 - 7 = x + 6.

Since we are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20 to represent the total number of people on the bus after the second stop.

Solving for x, we get x = 20 - 6 = 14.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He consumes 2 on his way to school, resulting in 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. 

Subsequently, Oscar purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which equates to 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Consequently, his total becomes 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. After consuming 3 lollipops that night, he is left with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we can model the charging process as an exponential function. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can express this relationship as:

Charge (C) = (t/3) + 60

where t is the time in minutes, and C is the charge percentage.

We want to find the time it takes to reach 100% charge, so we set C = 100 and solve for t:

100 = (t/3) + 60

Subtracting 60 from both sides:

40 = t/3

Multiplying both sides by 3:

t = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

t = 120/60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Erin has 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops, resulting in a total of 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. After giving 3 lollipops to Ella, Erin is left with 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops.

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to calculate the total rewards earned. The customer's loyalty card offers $1 off for every $20 spent. Given that they spent $80, we can calculate the rewards as follows:

Rewards = Total Spent / 20
Rewards = 80 / 20
Rewards = 4

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Therefore, the actual rewards they received is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent to find the amount they paid:

Amount Paid = Total Spent - Rewards
Amount Paid = 80 - 8
Amount Paid = 72

Therefore, the customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must consider the tax implications and net income for each option.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay for both jobs, we can see that Job B provides a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins, we first calculate the total number of ruined castles by multiplying 220 by 0.4.

Number of ruined castles = 220 * 0.4 = 88

Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we then divide the number of ruined castles by 2.

Number of unmanned ruined castles = 88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final Answer: The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we can calculate the total cost of each option by adding the advance payment to the total amount paid in monthly installments.

For Furniture United's offer, the total cost is $1,350 (advance payment) + $2,100 (6 * $350) = $3,450.

For Cozy Homes' offer, the total cost is $1,100 (advance payment) + $2,250 (9 * $250) = $3,350.

The cost difference between the two offers can be calculated as $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.

Final answer: $100"
"To determine the number of guns each individual would have if they were to share them equally, we can employ the concept of division. The total number of guns is the sum of the guns owned by each individual, which can be calculated as follows:

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns + Richard's guns
Total number of guns = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
Total number of guns = 24

To find the number of guns each individual would have, we can divide the total number of guns by the number of individuals, which is 4.

Number of guns per individual = Total number of guns / Number of individuals
Number of guns per individual = 24 / 4
Number of guns per individual = 6

Therefore, each individual would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount of sugar required for the suckers: 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces. 

Next, we add the amount of sugar needed for the fudge: 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces. 

The total amount of sugar required is the sum of these two quantities: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of compound percentage change. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price for the first year. The initial price is $8, and it increases by 50%. This can be represented as:

New price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
= $8 + ($8 * 0.50)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, we calculate the decrease in the stock price for the second year. The new price is $12, and it decreases by 25%. This can be represented as:

New price = Old price - (Old price * Decrease percentage)
= $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
= $12 - $3
= $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:

Total value = Number of shares * New price
= 8 * $9
= $72

Therefore, the final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L and the number of hot dogs John ate as J.

Given that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can express this relationship as:

J = 3L

We are also given that John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which can be represented as:

J = (1/2)T

Since we know that J = 3L and T = 3L, we can substitute the value of J in the second equation:

(1/2)T = (1/2)(3L)
(1/2)T = (3/2)L

Now, we can equate the two expressions for J:

3L = (3/2)L

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

6L = 3L

Subtracting 3L from both sides yields:

3L = 0

"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 200

x = 40

Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cows as x and the number of chickens as 2x, as stated in the problem.

We are given that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is 20 × 4 = 80.

Chickens, on the other hand, have 2 legs each, and there are 40 chickens (2x = 2 × 20). Therefore, the total number of legs from chickens is 40 × 2 = 80.

The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of the legs from cows and chickens, which is 80 + 80 = 160.

"To determine the number of balls Josh has after the incident, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. 

Initially, Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. This can be represented as an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 3 and the common difference d = 1. The number of terms (n) is 4.

The sum of an arithmetic sequence (S) can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)

Substituting the given values, we get: S = 4/2 * (2*3 + (4-1)*1)
Simplifying the equation: S = 2 * (6 + 3)
S = 2 * 9
S = 18

However, Josh lost 1 ball, so we subtract 1 from the total: 18 - 1 = 17

The final answer is 17."
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we must first establish the weight of each animal. Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce the weights of the other animals as follows:

1. The pink frog and the blue beetle have the same weight, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog and the green toad have the same weight, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, minus the weight of the red bird.

Total weight = (50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20) - 30

Total weight = 190 - 30

Total weight = 160

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower, which is twice the amount given by Laurel's friend. This can be expressed as 2 * 24.

Total outfits from friend and baby shower = 2 * 24 = 48

Next, we add the outfits gifted by Laurel's mom to the total. 

Total outfits = 48 + 15

Now, we perform the addition to find the total number of outfits.

Total outfits = 48 + 15 = 63

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the total distance covered by Tyson in June, we need to calculate the increased daily distance and then multiply it by the number of days in the month.

Given that Tyson's original daily distance is 5000 meters, his coach recommends an increase of 1/5 times this amount, which can be calculated as:

5000 * (1 + 1/5) = 5000 * (6/5) = 6000 meters per day

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June is:

6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance covered by Tyson in June is 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"To determine the price difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the price of Juice Box B by adding 5 dollars to the price of Juice Box A, which is 4 dollars. This yields Juice Box B's price as 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.

Next, we calculate the price of Juice Box C by adding 7 dollars to the price of Juice Box A, resulting in 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Finally, we find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B by subtracting the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total number of legs in the restaurant, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the number of tables with 4 legs as 'a' and the number of tables with 3 legs as 'b'. We are given that a = 40 and b = 50.

The total number of legs can be represented as 4a + 3b. Substituting the given values, we get:

Total legs = 4(40) + 3(50)
Total legs = 160 + 150
Total legs = 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, and then subtracting this value from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Let's denote the number of cookies in the bag as C, the number of cookies her son eats per day as S, the number of days her son eats cookies as D, and the number of cookies her husband eats per day as H. The number of days her husband eats cookies is also D.

Given:
C = 36 (total number of cookies in the bag)
S = 4 (number of cookies her son eats per day)
D = 5 (number of days her son eats cookies)
H = 1 (number of cookies her husband eats per day)

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband can be calculated as:
Total cookies consumed = S * D + H * D
= 4 * 5 + 1 * 7
= 20 + 7
= 27

Now, we can find the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat:
Cookies left for Jenny = C - Total cookies consumed
= 36 - 27
= 9

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can use the formula for percentage discount:

Discounted Price = Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price)

In this case, the original price of one shirt is $30, and the discount percentage is 40% or 0.4.

Discounted Price of one shirt = $30 - (0.4 * $30)
= $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought two shirts, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the discounted price of one shirt by 2:

Total Cost = 2 * $18
= $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the two shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we can calculate the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production periods.

The factory's original revenue from tractor production was $1000 per day, while their current revenue from silo production is $1100 per day. The difference in revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100.

To find the percentage increase, we can use the following formula:

Percentage increase = (Difference in revenue / Original revenue) * 100

Plugging in the values, we get:

Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final answer: 10"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on dog care, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure and then multiply it by 12. 

The monthly expenditure on food can be calculated by multiplying the weekly cost by 4, as there are approximately 4 weeks in a month. The weekly cost of food is $25, so the monthly cost is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Additionally, the monthly cost of treats is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine is $100. Therefore, the total monthly expenditure is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

To find the total annual expenditure, we multiply the monthly expenditure by 12: $220 * 12 = $2,640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To determine the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we can calculate the time for each activity and sum them up.

Given that the cooking class on Tuesday lasts three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation: 

Time of cooking class = 3 * Time of yoga class
Time of cooking class = 3 * 1
Time of cooking class = 3 hours

The museum tour on Thursday takes half as long as the cooking class, so we can express this relationship as:

Time of museum tour = (1/2) * Time of cooking class
Time of museum tour = (1/2) * 3
Time of museum tour = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the hours for all activities:

Time of yoga class + Time of cooking class + Time of cheese-tasting event + Time of museum tour + Time of errands
1 hour + 3 hours + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours

To find the total hours, we can use the associative property of addition:

Total hours = (1 + 3) + (0.5 + 1.5) + 2
Total hours = 4 + 2 + 2
Total hours = 8 hours

Therefore, the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 8 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of plant pots required for the daisies and roses. Since April needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can express this as 2 * 30 = 60. Therefore, the total number of pots required is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90.

Next, we subtract the total number of pots required from the initial number of pots April had: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount Andrea had as 'x'. We know that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. The total amount she spent is the sum of these two expenses, which is $11 + $4 = $15. Since she had $36 initially, we can set up the equation:

x - 15 = 36

To solve for x, we add 15 to both sides of the equation:

x = 36 + 15
x = 51

However, this is the total amount Andrea had initially. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount. Since we've already calculated the initial amount to be $51, we can directly subtract the total amount spent ($15) from this value:

Amount saved = Initial amount - Total amount spent
= 51 - 15
= 36

Therefore, Andrea saved $36."
"To determine the time spent sightseeing, we can first calculate the total time spent on the other activities. 

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as x. We know that John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, totaling 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. This accounts for 30% of the total time spent on vacation. We can express this as an equation:

0.3x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.3:

x = 15 / 0.3
x = 50

Now that we know the total time spent on vacation, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

Time spent sightseeing = 0.4x
Time spent sightseeing = 0.4 * 50
Time spent sightseeing = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating her total earnings from both jobs and adding it to her initial savings.

Let's break down her earnings from each job:

1. First job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200
2. Second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75

Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount she needs to save by subtracting her total earnings from the target amount:

$400 (target) - $275 (total earnings) = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125.

The final answer is: $125"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as x. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, its height can be represented as x + 5. The combined height of the two shortest trees is x + (x + 5) = 2x + 5.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it can be expressed as 2(2x + 5). Simplifying this expression yields 4x + 10.

Given that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, we can substitute x = 6 into the equation 4x + 10 to find the height of the tallest tree:

4(6) + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the amount of money Dean has left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Dean purchased. The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is 6 * $2 = $12. The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is 5 * $1 = $5. Therefore, the total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

Dean initially had $28. After purchasing the items, he has $28 - $17 = $11. His mother then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

Let's denote the cost of a round of mini-golf as $M and the cost of a go-kart ride as $G. We are given that M = $5 and G = $10. Since she wants to play once and ride the go-karts twice, the total cost for these activities is 2M + 2G.

The total cost of the activities is 2M + 2G = 2($5) + 2($10) = $10 + $20 = $30.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $30 (total cost) = $60.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $60 - $5 = $55.

To find the number of friends she can invite, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $55 ÷ $5 = 11.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 11 friends to her party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops per day. Given that she buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, the total daily expenditure can be calculated as:

Total daily expenditure = Number of lollipops * Cost per lollipop
= 4 * $0.25
= $1

Since Marisa saves the change, we can find the total amount saved by subtracting the total daily expenditure from her daily pocket money:

Total amount saved = Daily pocket money - Total daily expenditure
= $5 - $1
= $4

Therefore, Marisa saves $4 in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information and performing a series of algebraic manipulations.

Let's denote the number of pounds of candy Billy bought as x. We know that the total amount of money he had initially was $10, and he spent $2 on gumballs. Therefore, the amount of money he spent on candy is $10 - $2 = $8.

Given that the cost of candy is $1.5 per pound, we can set up the equation:

1.5x = 8

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5:

x = 8 / 1.5

x = 5.33

Therefore, Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to isolate the variable representing the son's age. Let's denote the son's age as S and the given information can be translated into the equation:

C = 2S - 5

Given that Carver is 45 years old, we can substitute C = 45 into the equation:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation yields:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 results in:

S = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25.

"To determine the number of days between services, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

Therefore, the train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.0375}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing required, we need to calculate the amount needed for each type of bed and then sum them up.

The amount of stuffing required for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. Since a collie bed takes the average of the two, we can calculate it as follows:

Average = (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing required for each type of bed:

- 4 chihuahua beds: 4 * 2 = 8 pounds
- 3 collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15 pounds

Total amount of stuffing required = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total time taken for the trip, we can break down the journey into two segments: the trip to his friend's house and the return trip.

The time taken to drive to his friend's house can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance to his friend's house is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

However, we must also account for the detour, which added 10 miles to the original distance. The additional distance can be incorporated into the calculation by adding it to the original distance:

Total distance to his friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Now, we can recalculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

The time taken to drive back home can be calculated using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the distance back home is 240 miles and the speed is 80 mph, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time taken for the entire trip by adding the time taken to drive to his friend's house and the time taken to drive back home:

Total time taken = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. Let's denote the total number of students as S, the number of absent girls as A_g, the number of absent boys as A_b, the number of present girls as P_g, and the number of present boys as P_b.

Given:
S = 96 (total students)
A_g = 5 (absent girls)
A_b = 4 (absent boys)

We are also given that the total number of girls is 43, so the number of present girls can be calculated as:
P_g = S - A_g - A_g (since the total number of girls is the sum of present and absent girls)
P_g = 96 - 5 - 5
P_g = 86

Now, we can find the number of present boys by subtracting the number of present girls from the total number of students:
P_b = S - P_g
P_b = 96 - 86
P_b = 10

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, we can express this relationship as a ratio of boys to girls, which is 2:1. 

Let's denote the number of girls as 'g' and the number of boys as '2g'. We are given that the number of girls is 6, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

g = 6

Now, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2:

Number of boys = 2g
Number of boys = 2(6)
Number of boys = 12

To find the total number of kids, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the points she needs on the third test as x. The total points required for promotion is 42, and she has already scored 33 points on the first two tests. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtracting 33 from both sides, we obtain:

x ≥ 9

Since x represents the minimum points required, the smallest integer value that satisfies this inequality is 9.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as y, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as z.

We are given the following information:

1. x = 3 (customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks)
2. y = 4x - 5 (customers kicked out for shoplifting)
3. z = 3y (customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale)
4. The total number of customers kicked out is 50

We can express the total number of customers kicked out as the sum of the customers kicked out for each reason: x + y + z = 50.

Substituting the expressions for y and z from equations (2) and (3), we get:

x + (4x - 5) + 3(4x - 5) = 50

Combine like terms:

x + 4x - 5 + 12x - 15 = 50

Combine like terms:

17x - 20 = 50

Add 20 to both sides:

17x = 70

Divide both sides by 17:

x = 70/17
x = 4.1176 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of x, we can find y and z:

y = 4x - 5
y = 4(4.1176) - 5
y ≈ 11.4714

z = 3y
z ≈ 3(11.4714)
z ≈ 34.4132

Since x, y, and z represent the number of customers, they must be whole numbers. However, the given equations do not guarantee whole number solutions. We can round the values to the nearest whole number, but this may not be the exact solution.

Given the original problem's constraints, we can assume that the number of customers must be a whole number. We can try different values of x to find a whole number solution.

"To determine Erin's initial score, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote Erin's initial score as E and Sara's initial score as S. We know that Erin scored 14 points and has three times more points than Sara after scoring. This can be expressed as:

E + 14 = 3(S + 8)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

E + 14 = 3S + 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

E = 3S + 10

We are also given that Sara scored 8 points. To find Erin's initial score, we can substitute S = 8 into the equation:

E = 3(8) + 10
E = 24 + 10
E = 34

Therefore, Erin had 34 points before scoring 14 points.

The final answer is: 34"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we can break down the expenses into distinct components and apply the relevant mathematical operations.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this amount is required for etching the logo. The total cost per frame can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + 0.20($20) = $20 + $4 = $24

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to account for the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. The total cost for the pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Additionally, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, which is 11 individuals. Each officer requires a cord costing $12. The total cost for the cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the senior gifts by summing up the individual costs:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

Therefore, the total cost of the senior gifts is $1198.

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we can apply a discount to the original price. The discount is 20% of the original cost, which can be calculated as:

Discount = 0.20 * Original Cost
= 0.20 * $400
= $80

Total Cost (DIY) = Original Cost - Discount
= $400 - $80
= $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of shoes sold on each day: 
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, we must account for the six returned shoes. To find the total number of shoes sold, we add the number of shoes sold on each day and then subtract the number returned:

Total number of shoes sold = (14 + 28 + 14) - 6
= 56 - 6
= 50

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

The final answer is 50."

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000. The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x. Therefore, the amount spent on functioning pieces can be calculated as:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = Total amount spent on all pieces - Amount spent on faulty pieces
= $400,000 - 0.4x

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 0.6 * 400,000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 400,000 / 0.6
x = 666,667

Now that we have the total number of pieces, we can find the amount spent on functioning pieces:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = $400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. Since she has 30 sheep, which can be divided into two equal groups of 15, we can calculate the total milk production from each group.

Let's denote the amount of milk obtained from the first half of the sheep as x. Since the second half also yields 2 kg of milk, the total milk production can be expressed as:

Total milk = (x + 2) * 2

We know that the total number of sheep is 30, so the amount of milk from the first half of the sheep (x) is half of the total milk production. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = (Total milk) / 2

Substituting the expression for total milk, we get:

x = ((x + 2) * 2) / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = x + 2

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

0 = 2

This equation is inconsistent, indicating that the initial assumption is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg from the other half, we can calculate the total milk production as:

Total milk = (1 * 15) + (2 * 15)

Total milk = 15 + 30

Total milk = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we must first calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding the children. Since Mrs. Sherman initially had a dozen (12) rolls and fed 6 to her children, the number of rolls left is:

12 - 6 = 6

Next, we need to calculate the total number of pieces created by breaking the remaining 6 rolls into 8 pieces each. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of rolls by the number of pieces per roll:

6 rolls × 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of remaining pupils: 40 - 20 = 20.

Then, we calculate the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils: 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, we find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we can analyze the given information. 

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday, which resulted in a revenue of $56. Given that the selling price per apple is $4, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Revenue / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. Since she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on each day:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we can employ a straightforward approach by subtracting the total number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing.

Let's denote the total number of socks that need washing as S, the number of pairs of socks washed as P, and the number of loose socks washed as L. We are given that S = 50, P = 10, and L = 15.

The total number of socks washed can be calculated as 2P + L, since each pair of socks contributes 2 socks and the loose socks are added as is. Therefore, the total number of socks washed is 2(10) + 15 = 35.

To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing: S - (2P + L) = 50 - (2(10) + 15) = 50 - (20 + 15) = 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had initially. We are given that she bought 23 cookies and received 42 cookies from Janet. 

Total cookies = Initial cookies + Cookies from Janet
Total cookies = 23 + 42
Total cookies = 65

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten by Rachel's brother. 

Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by brother
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
i = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650 [ 0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5 ] / [ (1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1 ]
M ≈ $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008167) ] / [ 1.008167 - 1 ]
M ≈ $3,650 [ 0.008333(1.008167) ] / 0.008167
M ≈ $3,650(0.008333)
M ≈ $30.25

The final answer is: $30.25"
"To determine the difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe, we can calculate the distance each of them covered using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time.

For Cho, the distance covered is:
Distance = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

For Chloe, the distance covered is:
Distance = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

The difference in distance hiked between Cho and Chloe can be found by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 km farther than Chloe.

Axel's silver holdings: 50
Axel's gold holdings: 80

Anna's silver holdings: 2 * Axel's silver holdings = 2 * 50 = 100
Anna's gold holdings: 80 + 40 = 120

Total silver holdings: Axel's silver + Anna's silver = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold holdings: Axel's gold + Anna's gold = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos: Total silver holdings + Total gold holdings = 150 + 200 = 350

The total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together is 350."
"To determine the profit per hour, we can employ the concept of marginal revenue and marginal cost. Millie's marginal revenue is the additional revenue generated from selling one more cup of lemonade, which is $1. Her marginal cost is the additional cost incurred from producing one more cup of lemonade, which is $0 (since she spends a fixed amount of $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers).

The profit per hour can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the number of hours spent running the lemonade stand. Since she sells all the lemonade, the total revenue is $36, and the total cost is $18. Therefore, the total profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours spent running the lemonade stand: $18 ÷ 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can express this as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to calculate the total number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

However, since the choir is performing with just the female members, we need to consider the total number of people participating. Initially, there are 26 girls. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to join the performance, increasing the total number of participants to 26 + 3 = 29.

Since half of the people performing can't make it to the show due to the bus breakdown, we need to find half of the total number of people participating. This can be calculated as 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, we will round down to 14.

Therefore, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we can calculate the arithmetic mean of his 5 test scores. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of scores.

Let's denote the scores as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The sum of the scores is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5, and the number of scores is 5. The arithmetic mean (average) is given by:

(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) / 5

Given the scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74, we can substitute these values into the formula:

(65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74) / 5

First, we calculate the sum of the scores:

65 + 94 = 159
159 + 81 = 240
240 + 86 = 326
326 + 74 = 400

Now, we divide the sum by the number of scores:

400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu, which is 1/3 of the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson. 

Number of messages to Mr. Yu = (1/3) * 66
= 66/3
= 22

Total number of messages = Number of messages to Ms. Thompson + Number of messages to Mr. Yu
= 66 + 22
= 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"To determine the amount of money David saves, we can calculate the cost of purchasing 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the cost-effectiveness of the ride bracelet. Since the bracelet allows for 9 rides, the cost per ride is $30 / 9 rides = $3.33 per ride. In comparison, buying 9 tickets would cost $18 / 9 rides = $2 per ride.

Given this information, we can conclude that David saves $3.33 - $2 = $1.33 per ride by purchasing the ride bracelet.

The final answer is $1.33."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to consider the total amount of ribbon available and the number of gifts she wants to create bows for. 

Given that Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and 12 gifts to create bows for, we can calculate the ribbon per gift as follows:

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a positive integer.

We are given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - 20% of $10, which is $2. Therefore, the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:

$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the percentage of Carol's total work time spent editing, we must first convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

The total work time can be calculated as the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
= 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
= 7 hours

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent editing:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
= 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent approximately 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Given that the shelving system consists of 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity can be calculated as 6 * 6 = 36 books.

Since Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we can express this as 2 * 36 + 20. 

Using the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can rewrite this expression as 2 * 36 + 20 = 72 + 20.

Combining like terms, we get 72 + 20 = 92.

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now possesses, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Initially, Erica had 20 cards, which she augmented by receiving 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. This yields a total of 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

Subsequently, Erica distributed 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, resulting in a net loss of 29 cards. Therefore, the updated total can be calculated as follows:

Total cards = Initial cards + Received cards - Given away cards
Total cards = 50 + 17 - 29
Total cards = 38

Therefore, Erica now possesses 38 Valentine's Day cards.

Final answer: 38"
"To determine the number of slices left, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total number of slices given away and then subtracting the slices consumed by Jenny.

Given that the pizza has 12 slices, Jenny gives 1/3 to Bill, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/3) = 4 slices. Similarly, she gives 1/4 to Mark, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/4) = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny initially had 12 slices and gave away 7 slices, leaving her with 12 - 7 = 5 slices. However, she also consumes 2 slices, resulting in a final count of 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. Let's calculate the remaining amount Mark needs to save:

Remaining amount = Cost of the bike - Initial amount
= $300 - $50
= $250

Since Mark earns $10 per day, we can calculate the number of days required to save the remaining amount as follows:

Number of days = Remaining amount / Daily earnings
= $250 / $10
= 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save for the bike.

Final answer: 25"
"To determine the total number of bugs, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Given that there are 90 spiders, the number of millipedes can be calculated as:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90 = 30

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. This can be expressed as:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Finally, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to obtain the total number of bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, we can express this as E = 30.

Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can express Beth's age as B = E + 5. Substituting E = 30, we get B = 30 + 5 = 35.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so we can express Alice's age as A = B + 7. Substituting B = 35, we get A = 35 + 7 = 42.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated as A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"To determine the total calories consumed by John, we can apply the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

Given that a glass of milk contains 8 ounces and each ounce has 3 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by multiplying the number of glasses by the ounces per glass and then by the calories per ounce.

Let's denote the number of glasses as 'g', the ounces per glass as 'o', and the calories per ounce as 'c'. The total calories consumed can be represented as:

Total calories = g * o * c

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3

Total calories = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we can employ the concept of total hours worked and hourly wage. Since the builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month, the total number of working days in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of working days in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

Given that the builder earns $50 per day, the total annual earnings can be calculated as:

Total Annual Earnings = Total Working Days * Daily Wage
= 288 days * $50/day
= $14,400

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can apply the concept of scaling a recipe. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, we can multiply these quantities by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we can divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by reducing the air conditioner usage from 8 hours to 3 hours a day, we can employ the concept of energy conservation and the unit conversion between watt-hours (Wh) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

First, let's calculate the energy consumption in watt-hours (Wh) for both scenarios:

Energy consumption in 8 hours = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 Wh

Energy consumption in 3 hours = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

The energy saved per day can be calculated as the difference between the two:

Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert the energy saved per day to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:

Energy saved per day (kWh) = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Now, let's calculate the total energy saved over 30 days:

Total energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the average number of stripes per zebra, we can employ the formula for mean, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, we have a total of four zebras with the following number of stripes: 17, 17, 36, and 18.

First, we need to calculate the sum of the number of stripes: 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 = 88.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of zebras to find the average: 88 / 4 = 22.

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total number of sandwiches needed as follows:

Total number of people = 20
Number of people per sandwich = 4
Total number of sandwiches = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich = 20 / 4 = 5

Now, we can calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required:

Total amount of meat = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds
Total amount of cheese = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound/sandwich = 5 pounds

Given the prices of meat and cheese, we can now calculate the total cost:

Cost of meat = Total amount of meat * Price per pound of meat
= 5 pounds * $7.00/pound
= $35.00

Cost of cheese = Total amount of cheese * Price per pound of cheese
= 5 pounds * $3.00/pound
= $15.00

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
= $35.00 + $15.00
= $50.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches is $50.00."
"To determine the combined total of corns and cannolis, we must first establish the initial quantities of each. Given that there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and Allan has 40 cannolis, we can deduce that the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

However, this initial quantity of corns is not accurate, as it is stated that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Therefore, the correct initial quantity of corns is 40 - 40 = 0.

After purchasing 60 more cannolis, the total number of cannolis becomes 40 + 60 = 100. Consequently, the number of corns is 2 * 100 = 200.

The combined total of corns and cannolis is 200 + 100 = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of steps taken during the jog as x. We know that Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, resulting in a total of 6,000 steps before the jog. After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which implies that the total number of steps he took during the jog plus the remaining steps equals 10,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6,000 + x + 2,000 = 10,000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8,000 + x = 10,000

Subtracting 8,000 from both sides yields:

x = 2,000

Thus, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we must consider the time required to read the book and the time needed to travel to the airport.

First, we calculate the time it takes to read the book. Given that the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute, so the time required to read the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Next, we add the time needed to travel to the airport, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for Toby to arrive at the airport is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Since Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, he will arrive 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This results in a total of:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, resulting in 30 employees remaining. The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy costs 2 pounds at $3 each, so the total cost of the taffy is 2 × $3 = $6. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $6 + $1.50 = $7.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $10.

Since Sally started with $10 and spent $10, we can conclude that she has $0 left.

The final answer is: $0"
"To calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, we can break down the problem into several steps. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the two packages of fireworks before the discount. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we need to calculate the discount on the two packages. The discount is 20% of the total cost, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. 

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packages to get the cost after the discount: $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to get the total amount Tim spent: $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that she consumes 2 cookies per night and desires to sustain herself for 30 days, the total number of cookies required can be calculated as follows:

Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can express this as a division problem:

Total cookies needed ÷ cookies per dozen = 60 ÷ 12

Simplifying this expression, we obtain:

Total dozens needed = 60 ÷ 12 = 5

Therefore, Shannon must prepare 5 dozens of cookies to meet her 30-day requirement.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can apply the concept of overlapping sets. Let's break down the problem into two distinct events: the occurrence of the defect (5% of the candles) and the explosion of the candles.

Let's define the following variables:

- A: The set of candles that smell like wet dog (5% of the total candles)
- B: The set of candles that explode

We are given that 5% of the candles have both defects, which implies that the intersection of sets A and B (A ∩ B) represents the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

Using the formula for the intersection of two sets, we can calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode as follows:

|A ∩ B| = |A| × |B| / |A ∪ B|

Since we are given that 5% of the candles have the defect, we can express this as:

|A| = 0.05 × 50,000 = 2,500

We also know that the total number of candles with the defect (A ∪ B) is 5% of the total candles, which is:

|A ∪ B| = 0.05 × 50,000 = 2,500

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

|A ∩ B| = 2,500 × 2,500 / 2,500
|A ∩ B| = 2,500

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

Final answer: 2500"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the regular price of each blouse. The discount is 30% of the regular price, which can be calculated as:

Discount = 0.3 * $20
= $6

The discounted price of each blouse is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the regular price:

Discounted price = $20 - $6
= $14

Since Misha purchases 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses can be calculated as:

Total cost = Number of blouses * Discounted price
= 4 * $14
= $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples from the average trees as z.

From the problem statement, we can establish the following equations:

1) 2x + 15 = 30 (since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and her sister gathers twice as many, which is 2x)
2) 3y + 45 = 15 (since Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees and her sister gathers 3 times as many, which is 3y)
3) x + y + z = 500 - (number of apples gathered from the average trees)

However, we can simplify equation (3) by recognizing that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60. Therefore, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 60).

Substituting this expression into equation (3), we get:

x + y + z = 500 - (3x + 60)
x + y + z = 440 - 3x
4x + y + z = 440

Now we have a system of three equations:

1) 2x + 15 = 30
2) 3y + 45 = 15
3) 4x + y + z = 440

We can solve equation (1) for x:

2x = 30 - 15
2x = 15
x = 15/2
x = 7.5

Substituting x into equation (2) to solve for y:

3y + 45 = 15
3y = -30
y = -10

Now that we have the values of x and y, we can substitute them into equation (3) to solve for z:

4(7.5) + (-10) + z = 440
30 - 10 + z = 440
20 + z = 440
z = 420

However, this solution is not feasible since z cannot be negative. Let's re-examine our equations.

Upon re-examination, we realize that the initial setup was incorrect. The correct setup should be:

1) 2x + 15 = 30 (Joanne's apples from tallest trees)
2) 3y + 45 = 15 (Joanne's apples from shortest trees)
3) x + y + z = 500 - (Joanne's apples from average trees)

Since Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, her sister gathers 2x apples from the tallest trees. We can set up the correct equation:

2x = 30
x = 15

Now, we can find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees:

3y + 45 = 15
3y = -30
y = -10

However, this solution is not feasible since y cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to recognize that the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 0, as previously established. This is because the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 60, and the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

Therefore, the correct solution is:

The final answer is 0."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which can be represented by the equation: c + d = 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304, with camels having 2 humps and dromedaries having 1 hump, leading to the equation: 2c + d = 304.

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find the values of 'c' and 'd'.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of 'c' in both equations:
2c + 2d = 360

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate 'c':
(2c + 2d) - (2c + d) = 360 - 304
d = 56

Now that we have found the value of 'd', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'c':
c + d = 180
c + 56 = 180
c = 124

Therefore, there are 124 camels and 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is 56."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down his journey into distinct segments and calculate the total distance traveled in each segment.

Let's denote the total distance traveled in the first 4 days as D1, the distance traveled in the next 2 days as D2, and the distance traveled in the second week as D3. We are given that D1 = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

We are also given that D2 is 30% of D1, which can be expressed as D2 = 0.3 * D1 = 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km.

Since Tom didn't travel on the 7th day, we don't need to consider that day in our calculations.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 km/day for 7 days, so D3 = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

The total distance traveled during the entire trip is the sum of the distances traveled in each segment: D_total = D1 + D2 + D3 = 800 km + 240 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the locker sizes. Let's denote Timothy's locker size as T, Zack's locker size as Z, and Peter's locker size as P.

Given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this relationship as:

P = (1/4)Z

We are also given that Peter's locker size is 5 cubic inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

5 = (1/4)Z

To solve for Z, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

Z = 5 * 4
Z = 20 cubic inches

Now that we have the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker, which is half as big as Zack's locker:

T = (1/2)Z
T = (1/2)(20)
T = 10 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 10 cubic inches in size.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we can utilize the concept of vertical displacement. Given that Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, the vertical displacement (or the distance Oliver must climb) can be calculated as follows:

Δh = h2 - h1

where Δh is the vertical displacement, h2 is the final elevation (10,000 feet), and h1 is the initial elevation (3,000 feet).

Δh = 10,000 - 3,000
Δh = 7,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7,000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's break down the information provided:

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

The total amount received from the banks is the sum of the individual amounts received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

Now, we can calculate the total capital by adding the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and fractions.

Initially, we have 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrive and each carry away 5 cats, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats removed. The remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which can be calculated as (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

Therefore, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break down the subscription into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, resulting in a total of 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are charged at the normal rate of $12 per month, yielding a total of 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 8 months are charged at the increased rate of $14 per month, resulting in a total of 8 * $14 = $112.

To determine the total cost for 2 years, we sum the costs of these three periods: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as x and the original price of the jogger jeans as y.

We are given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so we can express this as an equation:

y = x - 6

We are also given that Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and 2/3 coming from the tattered jeans. This translates to:

(1/3)y + (2/3)x = 6

Substituting the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

(1/3)(x - 6) + (2/3)x = 6

Simplifying the equation, we have:

(1/3)x - 2 + (2/3)x = 6

Combine like terms:

(3/3)x - 2 = 6

Simplify further:

x - 2 = 6

Add 2 to both sides:

x = 8

Now that we have found the original price of the tattered jeans, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:

y = x - 6
= 8 - 6
= 2

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

x - y
= 8 - 2
= 6

The final answer is: $6"

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the bird-attracting capacity of both the store-bought and homemade bird feeders.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder as B and the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder as H. We are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so H = B + 10.

We also know that Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders and builds 3 homemade feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3B, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3H.

Since H = B + 10, we can substitute this expression into the equation for the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3H = 3(B + 10) = 3B + 30.

Now, we can add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 3B + (3B + 30) = 6B + 30.

We are given that each feeder attracts 20 birds, so we can set up the equation 6B + 30 = 20(3 + 3) to represent the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders.

Simplifying the equation, we get 6B + 30 = 20(6) = 120.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 6B = 90.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get B = 15.

Now that we know the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder, we can find the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder: H = B + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

Finally, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 3B + 3H = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 120 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: 120"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the problem into individual components and apply mathematical operations to find the total.

Let's denote the cost of the bagel as B, the cost of the soup as S, and the cost of the cake as C. We are given the following information:

1. The bagel costs $4, so B = $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so S = B + 0.25B = 1.25B.
3. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so C = B/2.

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the expressions for S and C:

S = 1.25B = 1.25($4) = $5
C = B/2 = $4/2 = $2

To find the total cost, we add the costs of all items:

Total Cost = B + S + C
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The revenue generated from selling these cards is $50, and each card is sold for $1.5.

The revenue from selling 2/3 of the cards can be expressed as:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying the fractions and the price per card:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50
(2 * $1.5) / 3 * x = $50
$3 / 3 * x = $50
$1 * x = $50

Now, divide both sides by $1:

x = $50 / $1
x = 50

Therefore, Kenny initially had 50 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: 50"
"To address the problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by considering the total number of hotdogs required for each scenario.

Initially, the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. This implies that the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs for 18 guests, and the remaining 18 hotdogs were for the other 18 guests to have only one hotdog.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can calculate the total number of hotdogs required for 40 guests to have two hotdogs:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer initially prepared 36 hotdogs, we can calculate the number of hotdogs that were not sufficient for the additional 22 guests:

80 hotdogs (required) - 36 hotdogs (prepared) = 44 hotdogs

Since each hotdog is assumed to be a single unit, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is equivalent to the number of hotdogs that were not sufficient:

44 hotdogs

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the number of letters in Indras' name. Given that her name has 6 letters, we can represent this as a constant value: 6.

Next, we are told that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. To find half of 6, we can use the formula for half of a number: (6 ÷ 2) = 3.

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we can represent this as an expression: 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of letters in both names by adding the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7): 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can employ the concept of a discount on a total amount. The discount is 20% of the total cost, which can be calculated as follows:

Total cost = $120.00 (pot and pans) + $20.00 (mixing bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00

Discount = 20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

To find the final cost after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

Final cost = Total cost - Discount
= $165.00 - $33.00
= $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball, we can calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, for a total of $18.

To find the amount she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:

$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to purchase the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information provided step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Arthur slew = (3/4) * 100
= 75

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Walter slew = 2 * 75
= 150

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Bruce slew = (1/5) * 150
= 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since the 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15/5 = 3 gallons. 

Josey required 1/4 of a container, which is equivalent to 1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons. 

To convert gallons to pints, we utilize the conversion factor of 8 pints per gallon. Therefore, 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total amount spent on chips and then subtracting this from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars.

Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the total amount spent on candy bars is 75x cents. We know that George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. We also know that he spent 120 cents on chips. Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars can be represented as:

75x = 500 - 120
75x = 380

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 75:

x = 380 / 75
x = 5.07 (approximately)

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a candy bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it is more accurate to consider the exact value of 'x' as 5.07. Nevertheless, given the nature of the problem, we will round down to the nearest whole number, as we cannot purchase a fraction of a candy bar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can employ the concept of division. Given that Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself, the remaining lollipops are 20. Since these 20 lollipops were shared equally among 4 friends, we can calculate the number of lollipops each friend received as follows:

Number of lollipops per friend = Total remaining lollipops / Number of friends
= 20 / 4
= 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can apply basic principles of division and subtraction.

Given that the cake is divided into 8 equal pieces and 2 pieces are consumed, we can calculate the weight of the remaining cake as follows:

Weight of the cake = 20 ounces
Number of pieces = 8
Number of pieces consumed = 2

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the consumed pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - (2/8) * 20
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and then divide it by the total number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of oranges: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Next, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends). 

Total oranges ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound, and the cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box. 

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock: $2(2) + $2(2) = $4 + $4 = $8.

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8 + $8 = $16.

To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $16 / 6.

$16 / 6 ≈ $2.67

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the optimal departure time for Bernadette, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to arrive at the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to arrive as B. We are given that W = 4 minutes.

Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, we can express this relationship as B = 4W.

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation B = W - 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the second equation, we get 4W = W - 5. Solving for W is not necessary, as we are interested in finding the difference in departure times. Instead, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the difference in arrival times: B - W = 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get 4W - W = 5, which simplifies to 3W = 5. However, this is not the correct approach. We should instead find the time difference between Bernadette's and Wayne's arrival times.

Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, we can express her drive time as 4W. The correct approach is to set up the equation 4W = W + t, where t is the time difference between their departure times.

Rearranging the equation, we get 3W = t. Substituting W = 4, we find that t = 3W = 3(4) = 12.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first convert the length from yards to feet, as the standard unit of measurement for area is square feet. Given that 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Next, we can utilize the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = L * W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. We are provided with the area, which is 360 square feet, and the length, which we have determined to be 9 feet. By substituting these values into the formula, we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 * W

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we obtain:

W = 360 / 9
W = 40 feet

Now that we have determined the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula P = 2 * (L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.

P = 2 * (9 + 40)
P = 2 * 49
P = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet.

Final answer: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each one has by multiplying the number of packs by the number of beads per pack.

Elizabeth's total beads = (1 pack of red beads * 20 beads/pack) + (2 packs of clear beads * 20 beads/pack) = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth's total beads = (3 packs of blue beads * 20 beads/pack) + (4 packs of red beads * 20 beads/pack) = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters can be calculated as: 140 - 60 = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we can model the situation using a linear differential equation. Let's denote the initial temperature as T0 = 40 degrees, the rate of temperature increase due to baking as k = 5 degrees/hour, and the rate of cooling as m = 0.2 degrees/minute.

First, we need to convert the cooling rate to degrees/hour: m = 0.2 degrees/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 12 degrees/hour.

The differential equation describing the temperature change is:

dT/dt = k - m * T

where T is the temperature at time t.

To solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor or separation of variables. Let's use separation of variables:

dT / (k - m * T) = dt

Integrating both sides, we get:

∫(1 / (k - m * T)) dT = ∫dt

Evaluating the integrals, we get:

-1 / (m * ln|k/m|) * ln|k - m * T| = t + C

where C is the constant of integration.

Now, we can apply the initial condition T(0) = T0 to find C:

-1 / (m * ln|k/m|) * ln|k - m * T0| = C

Substituting the values, we get:

-1 / (0.2 * ln|5/0.2|) * ln|5 - 0.2 * 40| = C

Simplifying, we get:

-1 / (0.2 * ln(25)) * ln(20) = C

C ≈ 0.693

Now, we can find the final temperature T(t):

-1 / (m * ln|k/m|) * ln|k - m * T| = t + 0.693

Substituting the values, we get:

-1 / (0.2 * ln(5/0.2)) * ln|5 - 0.2 * T| = t + 0.693

Simplifying, we get:

-1 / (0.2 * ln(25)) * ln|5 - 0.2 * T| = t + 0.693

Now, we can solve for T:

ln|5 - 0.2 * T| = -t * (0.2 * ln(25)) - 0.693 * (0.2 * ln(25))

Taking the exponential of both sides, we get:

|5 - 0.2 * T| = e^(-t * (0.2 * ln(25)) - 0.693 * (0.2 * ln(25)))

Simplifying, we get:

|5 - 0.2 * T| = e^(-0.2 * t * ln(25) - 0.1386)

Now, we can solve for T:

5 - 0.2 * T = ± e^(-0.2 * t * ln(25) - 0.1386)

Since the temperature cannot be negative, we take the positive root:

5 - 0.2 * T = e^(-0.2 * t * ln(25) - 0.1386)

0.2 * T = 5 - e^(-0.2 * t * ln(25) - 0.1386)

T = (5 - e^(-0.2 * t * ln(25) - 0.1386)) / 0.2

Now, we can find the final temperature by substituting t = 3 hours:

T = (5 - e^(-0.2 * 3 * ln(25) - 0.1386)) / 0.2

T ≈ (5 - e^(-0.6 * ln(25) - 0.1386)) / 0.2

T ≈ (5 - e^(-1.39794 - 0.1386)) / 0.2

T ≈ (5 - e^(-1.53654)) / 0.2

T ≈ (5 - 0.1507) / 0.2

T ≈ 4.849 / 0.2

T ≈ 24.245

The final answer is 24.245."
"To determine James' time for the run, we can start by calculating the time difference between Jon's and James' swim times. Given that James finishes the swim 10% faster, we can express this as:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 minutes - (0.1 * 40 minutes)
= 40 minutes - 4 minutes
= 36 minutes

Next, we can calculate James' bike time, which is 5 minutes longer than Jon's bike time. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 minutes + 5 minutes
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, and his run time is 50 minutes. Therefore, James' run time can be calculated as:

James' run time = Jon's run time + 10 minutes
= 50 minutes + 10 minutes
= 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of Movie A as 'x', the length of Movie B as 'y', and the length of Movie C as 'z'. We are given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so we can express this relationship as:

x = (1/4)y

We are also given that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, which can be written as:

y = z + 5

Furthermore, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours, which we can convert to minutes by multiplying by 60:

z = 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes

Now, we can substitute the value of z into the equation y = z + 5 to find the length of Movie B:

y = 75 + 5
y = 80 minutes

Substituting the value of y into the equation x = (1/4)y, we can solve for the length of Movie A:

x = (1/4)(80)
x = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we can calculate the total amount of hay consumed and then multiply it by the cost per bail.

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time (in hours) = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Next, we can calculate the distance traveled by the horse using the formula:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 miles per hour * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay consumed is:

Total hay consumed = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Total hay consumed = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay consumed * cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so his total amount of money is:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses by dividing the total number of eggs by 5: 50 ÷ 5 = 10 glasses.

Given that each tray holds 5 glasses, we can find the number of trays by dividing the total number of glasses by 5: 10 ÷ 5 = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we must calculate the net change in points for both players. 

Initially, Joey has 214 points and scores 26 points, resulting in a total of 214 + 26 = 240 points. 

Meanwhile, Marcy, who starts with 225 points, scores 10 points, bringing her total to 225 + 10 = 235 points.

The difference between their scores represents the current lead of Joey. To find this, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score: 240 - 235 = 5.

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we can employ the concept of revenue and cost. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue generated from selling the sneakers at $20 and the revenue generated from selling the remaining sneakers at $25.

Let's break down the problem:

Total cost = $576
Number of sneakers sold at $20 = 17
Revenue from selling 17 sneakers = 17 * $20 = $340
Number of sneakers left = 48 - 17 = 31
Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25 = 31 * $25 = $775
Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of colors in the six packets containing eight colors each. This can be represented as 6 × 8, which equals 48. 

Next, we calculate the total number of colors in the four packets containing sixteen colors each. This can be represented as 4 × 16, which equals 64.

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112.

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as x.

The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18. Since the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

We know that the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 17 - x + 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 = 20 - x

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get:

-8 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 helium balloons after the price increase, we can employ a straightforward approach. Initially, we were given that the total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. This implies an average cost per balloon of $900 / 20 = $45.

Subsequently, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20, resulting in a new cost of $45 + $20 = $65 per balloon. 

To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons at this new rate, we can multiply the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon: 170 * $65 = $11,050.

The final answer is $11,050."
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Let's break down the trip into two segments: the first segment where the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, and the second segment where it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour.

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment. For the first segment, the distance is given by:

d1 = v1 * t1 = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles

For the second segment, the distance is given by:

d2 = v2 * t2 = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances:

d_total = d1 + d2 = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

The total time taken is the sum of the times taken for each segment:

t_total = t1 + t2 = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

v_avg = d_total / t_total = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

Therefore, the average speed of the car during the trip is 50 mph."
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

First, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Jenna initially had 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires. Given that sapphires are worth $800 each, the value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, we calculate the value of the rubies she received. Jenna received 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. Therefore, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies, which is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

The final answer is: $6400"
"To determine the total number of apples consumed by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can employ the concept of linear multiplication. Since both individuals consume 4 apples per day, we can calculate the total number of apples consumed by multiplying the daily consumption rate by the number of days.

Let's denote the daily consumption rate as 4 apples/day and the number of days as 30. The total number of apples consumed can be calculated as:

Total Apples = Daily Consumption Rate × Number of Days
Total Apples = 4 apples/day × 30 days
Total Apples = 120 apples

Therefore, Marin and Nancy will consume a total of 120 apples in 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds and then divide it by the capacity of each bag to find the number of bags needed. Finally, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to obtain the total cost.

Given that each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, the volume of one bed can be calculated as:

Volume = length x width x height = 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

Number of Bags = Total Volume / 2 cubic feet/bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost is:

Total Cost = Number of Bags x Cost per Bag = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

"To determine the total number of cards, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red cards as R, the number of green cards as G, and the number of yellow cards as Y.

We are given that there are 15 red cards, so R = 15.

We also know that the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. This can be expressed as:

G = R + 0.6R
G = 1.6R
G = 1.6(15)
G = 24

Furthermore, the problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards. This can be written as:

Y = R + G
Y = 15 + 24
Y = 39

To find the total number of cards, we can add the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = R + G + Y
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we can employ a straightforward approach. First, we calculate the total number of puppies by adding the number of puppies from both dogs: Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we identify the number of puppies with spots, which is the sum of the puppies with spots from both dogs: 3 (from Jennifer's dog) + 4 (from Brandon's dog) = 7.

To calculate the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula: (Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) * 100.

Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) * 100

Using the formula, we can calculate the percentage as follows:

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35\%}$"
"To determine the number of trips required to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This can be achieved by summing the weights of each item:

Total weight = (2 boxes of sugar cubes) + (4 bags of carrots) + (42 bales of hay) + (20 sacks of oats)
Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
Total weight = 4400 pounds

Next, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to determine the number of trips required:

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
Number of trips = 4400 / 2250
Number of trips = 1.96

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we can calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Let's denote the number of aluminum cans as A and the number of plastic bottles as B. We are given that A = 3 and B = 5. The value of an aluminum can is $0.02 and the value of a plastic bottle is $0.03.

The total weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings = (A * 0.02) + (B * 0.03)

"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of plants Frederick has as F, Toni has as T, and Shondra has as S.

Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can express this as:

F = 10

It is also stated that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. This can be represented as:

T = F + 0.6F
T = 1.6F

Substituting the value of F into the equation, we get:

T = 1.6 * 10
T = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

S = T - 7
S = 16 - 7
S = 9

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we can calculate their individual costs and then find the difference.

Becky's cost can be calculated as the product of the number of apples and the price per apple, minus the discount. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Cost = (Number of Apples) * (Price per Apple) - Discount
Cost = 20 * 0.45 - 1
Cost = 9 - 1
Cost = 8

Kelly's cost can be calculated similarly, taking into account the 10% discount:

Cost = (Number of Apples) * (Price per Apple) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
Cost = 20 * 0.50 - (0.10 * 10)
Cost = 10 - 1
Cost = 9

Now, to find the difference in the amounts paid by Becky and Kelly, we subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost:

"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we can employ the concept of arithmetic series. The height of the pyramid consists of four distinct layers: the base layer, the middle layer, the top layer, and the single girl at the apex.

Let's denote the height of the base layer as h1, the height of the middle layer as h2, and the height of the top layer as h3. We are given that the average height of the girls in each layer is 64 inches, except for the shortest girl, who is 60 inches tall.

The height of the base layer (h1) can be calculated as 4 times the average height of the girls in that layer: h1 = 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

The height of the middle layer (h2) can be calculated as 3 times the average height of the girls in that layer: h2 = 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The height of the top layer (h3) can be calculated as 2 times the average height of the girls in that layer: h3 = 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

The total height of the pyramid (H) is the sum of the heights of all layers, including the shortest girl at the apex: H = h1 + h2 + h3 + 60 = 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 576 inches.

"To determine the total cost of Paul's daily driving expenses, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

Let's break down the problem into two components: the cost of morning rides and the cost of afternoon rides. 

The cost of morning rides can be calculated as 2 rides per day multiplied by the cost per ride, which is $6. This yields a total of 2 * 6 = $12 per day for morning rides. 

Similarly, the cost of afternoon rides can be calculated as 2 rides per day multiplied by the cost per ride, which is $2. This yields a total of 2 * 2 = $4 per day for afternoon rides.

To find the total daily cost, we add the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides: $12 + $4 = $16 per day.

Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, we can multiply the daily cost by the number of days: 16 * 14 = $224.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during the two weeks.

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the combined total of oranges they brought and then divide that by the number of oranges required per pie.

Let's denote the number of boxes Ashley brought as A and the number of oranges per box as O. We know that A = 5 and O = 10. Therefore, the total number of oranges Ashley brought is A * O = 5 * 10 = 50.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so the number of oranges Brianne brought is A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25.

The total number of oranges they brought is 50 + 25 = 75.

Since one greek orange pie requires 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 75 / 3 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of guests.

The total cost of the first venue is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food, which is $5 per guest. Therefore, the total cost of the first venue can be represented as:

C1 = 200 + 5x

The total cost of the second venue is the per-guest charge of $25 times the number of guests. Therefore, the total cost of the second venue can be represented as:

C2 = 25x

Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20:

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express this relationship as:

z = y + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this relationship as:

y = x/2

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 43

Substituting the expressions for y and z in terms of x, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

y = x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

z = y + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick to purchase lumber, we can employ a cost-minimization strategy. By analyzing the cost per stick for each type of lumber, we can identify the most economical choice.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is calculated as:

Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

The cost per stick for 2 x 8 lumber is calculated as:

Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, purchasing 2 x 8 lumber is the most cost-effective option.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can produce, we can calculate the maximum number of 2 x 8 lumber he can purchase with $24:

Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4

The total number of sticks produced is then:

Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, Frederick can produce a maximum of 1600 popsicle sticks with the most cost-effective option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we can apply the principle of multiplication. Since each dog requires a pair of snowshoes, and the cost of each pair is $12.00, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

"To determine the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as F and the number of sheep on the farm as S, and the number of cows and sheep in the zoo as Z and W, respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. F = 30 (number of cows on the farm)
2. Z = 2F (number of cows in the zoo is twice the number of cows on the farm)
3. S = 0.5Z (number of sheep on the farm is half the number of sheep in the zoo)
4. W = 20 (number of sheep in the zoo)

We can express the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo as:
Total animals = F + S + Z + W

Substituting the given values, we get:
Total animals = 30 + 0.5Z + 2F + 20

Since Z = 2F, we can substitute this into the equation:
Total animals = 30 + 0.5(2F) + 2F + 20
Total animals = 30 + F + 2F + 20
Total animals = 50 + 3F

Now, we can substitute the value of F:
Total animals = 50 + 3(30)
Total animals = 50 + 90
Total animals = 140

"To determine the cost of the house, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the house as 'h' and the cost of the lot as 'l'. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express this relationship as:

h = 3l

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

h + l = 120,000

Substituting h = 3l into the second equation, we get:

3l + l = 120,000
4l = 120,000

Now, we can solve for 'l' by dividing both sides by 4:

l = 120,000 / 4
l = 30,000

Now that we have found the cost of the lot, we can determine the cost of the house by substituting 'l' into the equation h = 3l:

h = 3(30,000)
h = 90,000

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we can calculate the original and new weekly energy consumption and then find the difference.

Given that Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, we can calculate her original weekly consumption as follows:

Original weekly consumption = 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, the original weekly bill can be calculated as:

Original weekly bill = 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $126

Next, we need to calculate Ada's new weekly consumption after adding the device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. The new daily consumption can be calculated as:

New daily consumption = 12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

The new weekly consumption can be calculated as:

New weekly consumption = 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

The new weekly bill can be calculated as:

New weekly bill = 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $147

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill can be found by subtracting the original weekly bill from the new weekly bill:

Therefore, the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $21."
"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can apply the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as follows:

Time = (Total work) / (Number of workers)

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, the total work required to paint a whole house is 2 times the work done in 5 days. Therefore, the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house is:

Time = (2 * 5 days) / 1 person = 10 days

Now, we can apply the inverse proportionality concept to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = (Total work) / (Number of workers)
= (10 days) / 5 people
= 2 days

Therefore, it will take 5 people 2 days to paint a whole house.

"To determine the total number of sofas and chairs, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has can be represented as (x - 2). Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has is 3x.

We are given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:

Jenna's chairs = 3x = 3(22) = 66

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of Ophelia's sofas and chairs, and Jenna's chairs:

Total = (Ophelia's sofas) + (Ophelia's chairs) + (Jenna's chairs)

"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the CD and the remaining amount after purchasing the headphone set. The cost of the CD is $4, and the total amount paid is $48. 

Remaining amount = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Remaining amount = $48 - $4
Remaining amount = $44

Now, we can calculate the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of one CD.

Number of additional CDs = Remaining amount ÷ Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $44 ÷ $4
Number of additional CDs = 11

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he had not purchased the headphone set.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"

"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, resulting in 48 - 8 = 40 passengers remaining.

The number of passengers who get on the bus at the first stop is 5 times the number who got off, which is 5 * 8 = 40. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. The number of passengers who get on the bus at the second stop is 3 times fewer than the number who got off, which can be expressed as 21 / 3 = 7. Therefore, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 7 = 66.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote James' current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. We are given that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can express this as:

J + 5 = 27

Solving for J, we get:

J = 27 - 5
J = 22

We are also given that in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. We can express this as:

C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

Now, we can find the age difference between James and his cousin:

Age difference = C - J
= 47 - 22
= 25

Therefore, the age difference between James and his cousin is 25 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can utilize the information provided to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as C, the cost of the printer as P, and the cost of one monitor as M.

Given that the total cost of all items is $2,400, we can express this as:

C + P + M = 2400

We are also informed that the computer costs $1,100, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

1100 + P + M = 2400

Subtracting 1100 from both sides yields:

P + M = 1300

Furthermore, we know that the printer costs $400 less than the computer, which can be expressed as:

P = C - 400
P = 1100 - 400
P = 700

Now that we have the value of P, we can substitute it back into the equation P + M = 1300:

700 + M = 1300

Subtracting 700 from both sides gives us:

M = 600

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $600.

The final answer is: $600"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of seashells brought by each girl as 'g'. Since the boys brought 60 shells each, and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as:

g = 60 + 4 * 60

Simplifying the equation, we get:

g = 60 + 240
g = 300

Now, to find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls:

g = 300 / 10
g = 30

Therefore, each girl brought 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as N and the number of candies George had initially as G. We are given that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can express this relationship as:

N = 2G

We are also given that George ate 5 candies, resulting in him having 3 candies left. This can be represented as:

G - 5 = 3

Solving for G, we get:

G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can find the number of candies Nick had by substituting G into the equation N = 2G:

N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine Anne's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Chenny's age as C, Alyana's age as A, and Anne's age as N. We are given the following information:

1. C = 10 (Chenny is 10 years old)
2. A = C - 4 (Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny)
3. N = A + 2 (Anne is 2 years older than Alyana)

Substituting the value of C into the second equation, we get:
A = 10 - 4
A = 6

Now, substituting the value of A into the third equation, we get:
N = 6 + 2
N = 8

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

The first book's thickness is given as 31 mm. The second book's thickness is 50 mm. The third book's thickness is 5 mm less than the second book, which can be expressed as 50 - 5 = 45 mm. The fourth book's thickness is twice that of the first book, which can be calculated as 2 * 31 = 62 mm.

Now, we can calculate the total thickness by adding the thickness of all four books together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of vlogs she has already produced: 18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs.

Next, we subtract this total from the desired monthly target: 72 (monthly target) - 54 (total vlogs made) = 18 vlogs.

Therefore, Emma needs to create 18 more vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To calculate the total amount paid, we can apply the concept of compound interest, where the tip is a percentage of the original bill. In this scenario, the tip is 20% of the $50 bill.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total Amount = Original Bill + (Original Bill * Tip Percentage)
= $50 + ($50 * 0.20)
= $50 + $10
= $60

Therefore, the total amount paid is $60."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic algebraic manipulations and logical deductions.

Let's denote the initial amount each boy receives as x. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, we can express this as 3x = 18, which yields x = 6.

The eldest boy's initial share is $6, and he adds $5 to it, resulting in 6 + 5 = 11. The next day, he adds another $10, making his total 11 + 10 = 21.

However, he then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with 21 - 8 = 13.

Now, we're told that he triples the amount he had left after spending $8, which can be expressed as 3(13) = 39.

Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.

The final answer is: $39"
"To determine the daily savings amount for the second half of the month, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as x. Since Elvis aims to save twice as much in the second half, the daily savings in the second half can be represented as 2x.

The total monthly savings target is $1125, and we can express this as the sum of the savings in the first and second halves:

x + 2x = 1125

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 1125

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 375

This represents the daily savings in the first half of the month. To calculate the daily savings in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375 = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can determine the daily savings by dividing the total savings for the second half by 15:

750 ÷ 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis must save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of each type of fruit.

The cost of apples: 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
The cost of oranges: 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
The cost of peaches: 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Given that Verna paid with $20, the change she received can be calculated as follows:

Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so his total earnings for 20 tasks can be calculated as:

$0.8 per task × 20 tasks = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so her total earnings for 20 tasks can be calculated as:

$0.5 per task × 20 tasks = $10

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings:

$16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, 100 dollars, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

Since Jeff's share is four times Brad's share, Jeff's amount can be calculated as 4x, which is 4(20) = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we can employ the concept of total distance traveled, which is the product of the daily round-trip distance and the number of working days.

Given that Jeff's workplace is 3 miles away, the daily round-trip distance is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles. Since he works 5 days a week, the total miles walked can be calculated as:

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into distinct steps. 

First, we note that Elise writes the alphabet twice, which results in a total of 26 * 2 = 52 letters. This accounts for the entirety of the alphabet. 

Next, she writes half of the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. 

Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written, which includes the initial 52 letters and the additional 13 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters written is 52 + 13 = 65.

The total number of letters written by Elise is 65."
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is three times the number of families notified in the previous round. The first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 3.

The number of families notified in the nth round can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression: an = a * r^(n-1).

To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to calculate the sum of the first four terms of the geometric progression.

Let's calculate the number of families notified in each round:

Round 1: a = 3
Round 2: a * r = 3 * 3 = 9
Round 3: a * r^2 = 3 * 3^2 = 27
Round 4: a * r^3 = 3 * 3^3 = 81

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$"

x - 10(3) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 30 = 70

Adding 30 to both sides of the equation yields:

x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

Final answer: 100"
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

We can set up the equation: x + 2 = 5 * 80

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 400

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: x = 398

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we can apply the concept of a discount to the total cost of the items. The total cost of the items before the discount is:

5 notebooks × $1.50 = $7.50
2 pens × $0.25 = $0.50
1 calculator × $12 = $12
1 geometry set × $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

The shop offers a 10% discount on the total cost. To calculate the discount amount, we can multiply the total cost by the discount percentage (10% = 0.10):

Discount amount = 0.10 × $30 = $3

Now, we can calculate the total cost after the discount by subtracting the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:

Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

Therefore, Daniel needs to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we can employ the principle of arithmetic addition. The cost of the hamburgers can be represented as 5 × $4, the cost of the potato fries as 10 × $0.30, and the cost of the fruit drinks as 5 × $2. By applying the distributive property of multiplication over addition, we can simplify these expressions:

Total Cost = (5 × $4) + (10 × $0.30) + (5 × $2)
= $20 + $3 + $10
= $33

Given that Carly pays with a $50 bill, we can determine the change by subtracting the total cost from the $50 bill:

Change = $50 - $33
= $17

Therefore, Carly receives $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we can employ a two-part approach, considering the commission structure for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales exceeding $1000.

First, we calculate the commission for sales up to $1000, which is 30% of $1000. This can be expressed as:

Commission for sales up to $1000 = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

Next, we determine the additional commission for sales exceeding $1000. Since Antonella's sales amount is $2500, the excess amount is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). The additional commission for this excess amount is 10% of $1500, which can be calculated as:

Additional commission for sales over $1000 = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Now, we sum the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000 to obtain Antonella's total earnings:

Total commission earned by Antonella = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles required for the 70 guests, which is 70 guests * 2 bottles per guest = 140 bottles. 

Next, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already possesses from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to acquire 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a cold day as $t_c$ and on a hot day as $t_h$. We are given that $t_c = 16$ minutes. The problem states that on a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. This can be expressed as:

$t_h = 2t_c + 2$

Substituting the given value of $t_c$, we get:

$t_h = 2(16) + 2 = 34$ minutes

Now, we can find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day by multiplying the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:

$3t_h = 3(34) = 102$ minutes

Similarly, the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day is:

$3t_c = 3(16) = 48$ minutes

The time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:

$\Delta t = 3t_h - 3t_c = 102 - 48 = 54$ minutes

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on his hourly wage and work schedule.

Given that John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

Weekly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked per day * Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week
Weekly earnings = $40/week

Now, we can divide the target savings amount ($80) by the weekly earnings to determine the number of weeks required:

Number of weeks = Target savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40
Number of weeks = 2

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we can calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub by multiplying the cost of the foot-long fish sub by 3.

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 * $40
Cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $120

Total cost for both subs = $40 + $120
Total cost for both subs = $160

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in each category of buttons and then summing the results.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We are given that x + y = 21 (since the total number of buttons is 21). We also know that the number of holes in the buttons with two holes is 2x and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 4y.

The total number of holes in the bag can be represented as 2x + 4y. Since we know that x + y = 21, we can express y as 21 - x. Substituting this into the expression for the total number of holes, we get:

2x + 4(21 - x) = 2x + 84 - 4x
= -2x + 84

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since x represents the number of buttons with two holes, it must be a non-negative integer. We can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the condition x + y = 21.

Let's try x = 7 (since we know there are 7 buttons with two holes). Then, y = 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes:

2x + 4y = 2(7) + 4(14) = 14 + 56 = 70

Therefore, the total number of holes in the bag is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can apply the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can express this as a ratio: Zack's locker size = 1/2 * Timothy's locker size.

Let T represent Timothy's locker size in cubic inches. Then, Zack's locker size = (1/2)T.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this as another ratio: Peter's locker size = (1/4) * Zack's locker size.

Substituting the expression for Zack's locker size, we get: Peter's locker size = (1/4) * (1/2)T = (1/8)T.

Given that Timothy's locker size is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute T = 24 into the expression for Peter's locker size: Peter's locker size = (1/8) * 24 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches in size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is not explicitly stated, we will assume it to be 2 cups (a common daily coffee recommendation). Therefore, Octavia drinks 0.5 cups.

Juan's coffee consumption is 10 times Octavia's, so he drinks 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The doctor has advised Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract 4 from 5.

5 - 4 = 1

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we can calculate the total number of rodents as follows:

Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G. We are given that H = 3 * 10 = 30 and G = 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents (T) can be calculated by adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs:

T = H + G
T = 30 + 15
T = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To determine the average weight of the three individuals, we can employ the concept of arithmetic mean. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:

Average = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals

Given Mark's weight as 150 pounds and Susan's weight as 20 pounds less than Mark's, we can express Susan's weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Since Bob's weight is twice that of Susan's, we can calculate his weight as 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their weights:

Sum of weights = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
= 150 + 130 + 260
= 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the sum of their weights by the number of individuals:

Average weight = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals
= 540 / 3
= 180 pounds

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion and trigonometry. 

Given that the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it has moved upward in 10 hours as 5 * 10 = 50 degrees. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. Therefore, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun can be calculated as the sum of the initial angle and the total angle the sun has moved upward: 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

θ = 32° + 50°

θ = 82°

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the age of the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years.

Since James has two sons, he requires a total of 2 * 5 = 10 candles. Each pack of 5 candles costs $3, so the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (Number of Candles) * (Cost per Pack)
Total Cost = 10 * $3
Total Cost = $30

Therefore, James spends $30 on birthday candles.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of pages she read in the first week and the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes she spent reading in the first week is:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week by dividing the total minutes by the reading rate of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes:

(105 minutes) / (1.5 minutes/page) = 70 pages

Given that she read a total of 100 pages in the second week, we can find the total number of pages she read in two weeks by adding the pages read in the first and second week:

70 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 170 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 170 pages in two weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can employ the concept of subtraction. Initially, Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody consumed a third of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as 12 * (1/3). Trevor then consumed a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be expressed as 12 * (1/4).

To find the total number of sandwiches consumed, we add the amounts consumed by Cody and Trevor: 12 * (1/3) + 12 * (1/4). To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. We can rewrite the fractions as 12 * (4/12) and 12 * (3/12), respectively. Adding these fractions yields 12 * (4/12) + 12 * (3/12) = 12 * (7/12) = 7.

Now, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the initial amount: 12 - 7 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

Given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, we have:

S = 44

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This relationship can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into distinct components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the amount of money the tooth fairy left for the first tooth as $5.00. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. Therefore, the total amount for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by adding the amounts for each set of teeth: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

Given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can express this relationship as:

R = M + 20

Additionally, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be represented as:

R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals. Substituting R = 80 into the first equation, we can solve for M:

80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have found M, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for A:

80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

With the values of M and A determined, we can now calculate the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate the total amount of money each individual made by multiplying the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade.

Let's denote the number of lemonades sold by Mitchell as M and the price per lemonade as P. We are given that M = 21 and P = $4. The total amount of money Mitchell made is then MP = 21 * 4 = $84.

Liam's earnings can be represented as LP. We are given that LP = $63. To find the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: MP - LP = 84 - 63.

The difference in earnings is $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down his expenditure into two categories: wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter has $70. He spends $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, for a total of 3 days. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 3 = $15

This leaves him with $70 - $15 = $55.

For the remaining 4 days (Thursday to Sunday), Peter buys plastic action figures at $2 each. The total number of plastic action figures he can purchase is:

$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he cannot buy a fraction of a figure, we can round down to 27 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

3 (wooden) + 27 (plastic) = 30

Therefore, Peter will have 30 action figures by the end of the week.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we can employ a straightforward additive approach. The cost of spaying the kitten is a one-time expense, while the cost of the vaccines and the broken vases can be calculated using simple arithmetic operations.

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the vaccines can be determined by multiplying the number of vaccines (3) by the cost per vaccine ($20), resulting in a total of $60. Similarly, the cost of the broken vases can be calculated by multiplying the number of vases (4) by the cost per vase ($12), yielding a total of $48.

To obtain the overall cost, we can add these three amounts together: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

Therefore, the total cost of the kitten is $308."
"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

First, we calculate the total number of roses required per month by multiplying the number of roses ordered by each shop by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks). 

Let's denote the number of roses ordered by the first, second, and third flower shops as R1, R2, and R3, respectively. We are given that R1 = 20, R2 = 15, and R3 = 30. The total number of roses required per week is the sum of the roses ordered by each shop: R_total/week = R1 + R2 + R3 = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65.

To find the total number of roses required per month, we multiply R_total/week by 4: R_total/month = R_total/week * 4 = 65 * 4 = 260.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find the number of roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses required per month: Roses_lacked = R_total/month - 40 * 4 = 260 - 160 = 100.

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can utilize the concept of present value of an annuity. The formula for the present value of an annuity is:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where:
PV = present value
PMT = monthly withdrawal amount = $100
r = monthly interest rate (assuming 0% interest, as no interest rate is mentioned)
n = number of periods = 24 months

Since we are not considering interest, the formula simplifies to:

PV = PMT * n
PV = $100 * 24
PV = $2400

Now, subtracting the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:
Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
Remaining amount = $3000 - $2400
Remaining amount = $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we can employ the following steps:

1. Determine the total revenue generated from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.

Total Revenue = Number of Sandwiches Sold × Price per Sandwich
Total Revenue = 10 × $7.00
Total Revenue = $70.00

2. Calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 sandwiches.

Cost of Bread per Loaf = $3.00
Number of Loaves Needed = 1 (since 1 loaf yields 10 sandwiches)
Cost of Bread = Number of Loaves × Cost of Bread per Loaf
Cost of Bread = 1 × $3.00
Cost of Bread = $3.00

Cost of Cheese and Condiments per 10 Sandwiches = $30.00
Total Cost of Cheese and Condiments = $30.00

Total Cost = Cost of Bread + Cost of Cheese and Condiments
Total Cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total Cost = $33.00

3. Compute the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net Profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we first need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we can calculate the number of muffin crayons by dividing the total number of crayons by 8:

192 ÷ 8 = 24

Now, to find the total amount of money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin:

24 * $1.50 = $36

Therefore, Kate can make $36 by selling her muffin crayons.

The final answer is $36."
"To determine the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we must consider the various components involved in the process. The cost can be broken down into the cost of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

First, we calculate the area of the room, which is the product of its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is then calculated by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is similarly calculated: 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is found by multiplying the area by the removal cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

Finally, the cost of installation is calculated by multiplying the area by the installation cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

To find the total cost, we sum these individual costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet in Michael's bedroom is $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

Let's denote the total number of birds as the sum of the birds seen on each day: 
S = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90

Simplifying the expression, we get:
S = 280

Since there are 7 days, we can calculate the average by dividing the total number of birds by 7:
Average = S / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the problem into a series of mathematical operations. Let's denote the starting value as 'x'. According to the problem, the starting value is 20, so x = 20.

The problem states that the starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Mathematically, this can be represented as (x + x/2) / 5.

The problem also states that the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be represented as ((x + x/2) / 5) * (x - 12).

Substituting x = 20 into the equation, we get:

((20 + 20/2) / 5) * (20 - 12)
= ((20 + 10) / 5) * 8
= (30 / 5) * 8
= 6 * 8
= 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as B and the number of cards his brother has as Br. We are given that the brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so we can express this relationship as:

Br = B - 3

We are also given that the boy has 5 cards, so B = 5. Substituting this value into the equation, we can solve for Br:

Br = 5 - 3
Br = 2

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of cards the boy and his brother have:

Total = B + Br
Total = 5 + 2
Total = 7

Therefore, the boy and his brother have a total of 7 cards together.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 

4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

To find the correct temperature setting, we add the calculated value to the original temperature: 

520 + 20.8 = 540.8

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540.8}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we convert both times to minutes: 
1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the combined value of the two houses, we can calculate the value of Juan's house by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Let's denote Herb's house value as H and Juan's house value as J. We are given that H = $76,000. To find J, we can use the following equation:

J = H - (0.3H)
J = 0.7H
J = 0.7($76,000)
J = $53,200

Now, we can find the combined value of the two houses by adding their values:

Combined value = H + J
= $76,000 + $53,200
= $129,200

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200."
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cups and the number of dishes.

Let's denote the number of cups Judy brought as C and the number of dishes she brought as D. We are given that Judy bought a dozen (12) cups, so C = 12. We are also given that Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so D = 2C = 2(12) = 24.

We are also given that Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is D + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44.

The total number of cups is the sum of Judy's cups and her friend's cups: C + 40 = 12 + 40 = 52.

The total number of dishes is the sum of Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: D + 44 = 24 + 44 = 68.

Therefore, the total number of utensils is the sum of the total number of cups and the total number of dishes: 52 + 68 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that 90 single-use contacts comprise one box and will last Pete 45 days, we can calculate the cost per pair by first determining the total number of pairs in two boxes.

Let's denote the total number of pairs in two boxes as 'x'. Since one box contains 90 pairs, two boxes will contain 2 * 90 = 180 pairs. 

The cost of two boxes, with a 10% discount, can be calculated as follows:

Original price of two boxes = 2 * $100.00 = $200.00
Discount amount = 10% of $200.00 = 0.10 * $200.00 = $20.00
Discounted price of two boxes = $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair by dividing the discounted price of two boxes by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Discounted price of two boxes / Total number of pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we can calculate their individual earnings using the given information.

Let's denote Jill's hours worked on Saturday as J_S and Jill's hours worked on Sunday as J_U. We are given that Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday (J_S = 2) and 1 hour on Sunday (J_U = 1). 

Since John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, his hours worked on Saturday can be calculated as 2 * J_S = 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Similarly, John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so his hours worked on Sunday can be calculated as 3 * J_U = 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The total hours worked by John is the sum of his hours worked on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 

Jill's total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 

Given that both John and Jill earn $10 per hour, John's total earnings can be calculated as 7 * $10 = $70, and Jill's total earnings can be calculated as 3 * $10 = $30.

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total energy expenditure from her physical activities. 

Given that aerobics burns 500 calories/hour and she spends 2 hours doing aerobics, the total calories burned from aerobics can be calculated as:

Calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours
Calories burned from aerobics = 1000 calories

Additionally, running burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour, resulting in:

Calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour
Calories burned from running = 600 calories

The total energy expenditure is the sum of calories burned from aerobics and running:

Total energy expenditure = Calories burned from aerobics + Calories burned from running
Total energy expenditure = 1000 + 600
Total energy expenditure = 1600 calories

Since Hannah requires 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can calculate the total amount of water needed by dividing the total energy expenditure by 200:

Total water needed = Total energy expenditure / 200
Total water needed = 1600 / 200
Total water needed = 8

Therefore, Hannah needs 800 ml of water.

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, which can be expressed as:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as:

R = 0.99B

Furthermore, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we obtain:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine the B terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we have found the value of B, we can calculate the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the average of Jared's typing speeds, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean:

Average = (Initial speed + Increased speed + New speed) / Number of measurements

Given the initial speed (47 WPM), increased speed (52 WPM), and the additional increase of 5 WPM, we can calculate the new speed as follows:

New speed = 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, we can calculate the average:

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3

To compute the sum, we can use the commutative property of addition:

Average = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3
Average = (150) / 3

Dividing 150 by 3 yields:

Average = 50

Therefore, the average of Jared's typing speeds is 50 WPM."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over the 5-week period.

Let's denote the weight change per week for the Cheerios option as -1.25 pounds/week and for the donuts option as +1.75 pounds/week. The total weight change over 5 weeks can be calculated as:

Weight change for Cheerios = -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change for donuts = +1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = +8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the weight change for donuts minus the weight change for Cheerios:

Difference in weight = |8.75 - (-6.25)| = |8.75 + 6.25| = 15 pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast over a 5-week period is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of individuals attending the event, we can employ a systematic approach to account for the invited guests, their friends, and their spouses.

First, we consider the initial number of people invited by Alex, which is 100. Each of these individuals plans to bring 2 friends, resulting in an additional 200 guests. Furthermore, Alex directly invites 10 friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, contributing an additional 18 individuals.

To calculate the total number of attendees, we sum the initial number of invited guests, the number of friends, and the number of friends' spouses:

100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can analyze the given information step by step. 

First, we know the weight of the Affenpinscher, which is 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so its weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds. 

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. 

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so its weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we can calculate the total cost of the boots on each platform and then find the difference.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

The difference in cost between Amazon and eBay can be calculated as follows:

Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days required for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's window height, we can model the growth of the beanstalk using an exponential function. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles in height every day, we can express its height on day t as:

h(t) = 4 \* 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk on day t.

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that h(t) > 20. To do this, we can set up the inequality:

4 \* 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator, we find that log2(5) ≈ 2.32.

Since t must be an integer, the smallest value of t that satisfies the inequality is t = 3.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total grams of protein John gets per week, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can establish a ratio of protein to weight. 

First, we calculate the grams of protein per gram of mushrooms: 3 grams of protein / 100 grams of mushrooms = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms.

Next, we can multiply this ratio by the total grams of mushrooms John consumes daily (200 grams) to find the total grams of protein he ingests daily: 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms * 200 grams of mushrooms = 6 grams of protein per day.

Finally, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to account for the number of days in a week: 6 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 42 grams of protein per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote Jerry's current age as x. The given information states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Thus, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost of the dental work, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount George still owes after the initial deposit. The cost of the implants and the crown is $4500, and he has already paid $600. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to cover is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

Next, we can divide the remaining amount by George's hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work. 

Let's calculate the number of hours: $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

The final answer is: $oxed{260}"
"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is a fundamental property that can be expressed as:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

where x represents the measure of the smallest angle. Combining like terms, we obtain:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 30

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the measures of the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the largest angle is 3x, we can conclude that the largest angle measures 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball.

Colby's total amount of money can be calculated as follows:

8 quarters = 8 × $0.25 = $2.00
6 dimes = 6 × $0.10 = $0.60
14 nickels = 14 × $0.05 = $0.70
15 pennies = 15 × $0.01 = $0.15

Adding these amounts together, we get:
$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find the number of gumballs Colby can buy:
$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet: 

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we sum the total number of legs: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the store is 48.

The final answer is 48."
"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we calculate the weight he initially increased by 50%, which is 50% of 8 pounds.

The weight increase is calculated as 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds.

Next, we add this increase to the original weight to find the new weight: 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

However, Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than this, so we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can employ a systematic approach to calculate the cumulative total.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This results in a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve again receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month, yielding a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month, resulting in a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games. Furthermore, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 34.

"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of constant velocity. Given that the plane maintains a constant velocity, we can apply the formula:

Time = Distance / Velocity

First, we need to calculate the velocity of the plane, which is the distance traveled divided by the time taken:

Velocity = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Velocity = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this velocity to find the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = Distance / Velocity
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa made together, we need to calculate their individual production rates and then sum their outputs over the 12-hour period.

Ruiz's production rate can be calculated as 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour. This is a constant rate, so we can multiply it by the number of hours worked to find the total output: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds.

Marissa's production rate is 3/4 times Ruiz's rate, which is (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds/hour. Similarly, we can calculate her total output by multiplying her rate by the number of hours worked: 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is the sum of their individual outputs: 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total expenditure and subtract it from his initial amount.

Let's denote the amount spent on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, and Wednesday as W. We are given that M = $8, T = 2M, and W = 4T.

We can express the total expenditure as the sum of the individual expenditures: Total Expenditure = M + T + W.

Substituting the given values, we get:
Total Expenditure = $8 + 2($8) + 4(2($8))
= $8 + $16 + $32
= $56

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Howard has left:
Amount Left = Initial Amount - Total Expenditure
= $100 - $56
= $44

The final answer is $44."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can employ the concept of linear equations. Let's break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

During the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This can be represented by the equation:

Total earnings (first 4 hours) = (15 cups/hour) * ($0.50/cup) * (4 hours)
Total earnings (first 4 hours) = 15 * 0.50 * 4
Total earnings (first 4 hours) = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This can be represented by the equation:

Total earnings (next 2 hours) = (10 cups/hour) * ($0.60/cup) * (2 hours)
Total earnings (next 2 hours) = 10 * 0.60 * 2
Total earnings (next 2 hours) = $12

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods:

Total earnings = Total earnings (first 4 hours) + Total earnings (next 2 hours)
Total earnings = $30 + $12
Total earnings = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by this value.

Given that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, we can calculate the total number of rotations per mile driven by multiplying the number of rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month:

362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year as follows:

145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Finally, we can calculate the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced by dividing the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:

10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can establish a ratio of washings to pumps. 

Let's denote the cost of 1 pump as x. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. We can set up a proportion to find the cost of 1 pump:

(2 pumps / 120 washings) = (1 pump / x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 120

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 120 / 2
x = 60

Now, we need to convert the cost from dollars to cents. Since $1 = 100 cents, we can multiply x by 100:

x = 60 * 100
x = 6000 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 6000 cents, or $6.00.

The final answer is $6."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we can apply the discount to the original prices of the items and then add the sales tax.

First, calculate the discounted price of the shirt: 
$25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, calculate the total cost of the outfit before tax: 
$17.50 (shirt) + $35 (shorts) = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount:
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

To find out how much money Joe will have left, subtract the total cost from his initial budget:
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that he will not have enough funds to purchase the outfit."
"To determine the total amount of butter required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to produce 1 dozen croissants, we can express this as a ratio: 1 dozen : 1/4 pound. To find the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants per day, we can multiply the number of croissants by the ratio.

Let's calculate the amount of butter required per day:

4 dozen croissants/day × (1/4 pound / 1 dozen) = 4 × (1/4) = 1 pound/day

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day × 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to produce 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we can calculate the cost of repaving each street and then find the difference.

The cost of repaving a street is given by the product of the cost per meter and the length of the street. Let's denote the cost per meter as C and the length of the street as L.

For Monica's street, the cost is: C × L = $194 × 150
For Lewis' street, the cost is: C × L = $194 × 490

To find the difference in cost, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = (C × L) - (C × L) = $194 × 490 - $194 × 150
= $194 × (490 - 150)
= $194 × 340
= $65,560

Therefore, the cost of repaving Lewis' street is $65,560 more than the cost of repaving Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,560"
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months. The initial 5 months received a fixed funding of $100,000 per month, resulting in a total cost of $500,000.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month, which can be modeled using a geometric progression (GP) with a common ratio of 1.5. The funding for each of the remaining 5 months can be calculated as follows:

- Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 x 1.5 = $759,375

The total cost for the remaining 5 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a GP:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term ($150,000), r is the common ratio (1.5), and n is the number of terms (5).

S = $150,000 * (1 - 1.5^5) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $150,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $150,000 * 13.1875
S = $1,976,250

Now, we add the total cost for the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months:
$500,000 + $1,976,250 = $2,476,250

The total cost of John's research is $2,476,250."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces. The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat. Therefore, we can disregard their contributions to the total.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we can utilize the concept of daily posting frequency and the total number of days in the month. Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the daily posting frequency by the total number of days in March to determine the total number of posts.

Let's denote the daily posting frequency as 'd' and the total number of days in March as 't'. We are given that d = 3 and t = 31.

Total number of posts in March = d * t
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93."
"To determine the total annual expenditure on water for laundry, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Gary performs laundry twice a week, we can calculate the total number of loads per year as 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads.

Each load of laundry consumes 20 gallons of water, so the total water usage for the year is 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons.

The cost of water is $0.15 per gallon. Therefore, the total annual expenditure on water for laundry can be calculated as 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we can employ a straightforward additive approach. The total cost can be calculated as the sum of the individual costs of each item.

The aquarium's cost is $10.00. The cost of the rocks is 2 bags × $2.50 per bag = $5.00. The cost of the coral is 3 pieces × $2.00 per piece = $6.00. The cost of the fish is 20 fish × $0.50 per fish = $10.00. Lastly, the cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding these amounts together: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00.

Therefore, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 3 inches, and it doubles in height every week. In the first week, it grows by a factor of 2, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the second week, it grows by another factor of 2, resulting in 6 * 2 = 12 inches. In the third week, it grows by 4 inches, resulting in 12 + 4 = 16 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 16 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, his daily meat sales can be calculated as:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull (750 kg) by the daily meat sales (150 kg) to find the number of days required to sell the meat:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are then calculated by subtracting the seats occupied by administrators from the total seats:
Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Now, we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats:
Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Finally, we determine the number of seats occupied by students by subtracting the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats:
Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that each intersection has 6 poles, each with 4 functioning street lights, the total number of functioning street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

With 4 intersections in total, the overall number of functioning street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, we are informed that 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the number of functioning street lights, we can subtract the non-functioning lights from the total: 96 - 20 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we can calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD and then sum them up.

Let's denote the remaining lifespan of the first DVD as R1 and the second DVD as R2. We know that R1 = 1000 - 356 and R2 = 1000 - 135.

R1 = 644
R2 = 865

The total number of times both DVDs can be played is the sum of their remaining lifespans: R1 + R2 = 644 + 865.

Total number of times both DVDs can be played = 644 + 865 = 1509.

"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we can employ the concept of total hours attended and the cost per hour. Given that John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, we can first determine the total number of sessions:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Since each session is 2 hours long, the total number of hours can be calculated as:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost can be found by multiplying the total hours by the cost per hour:

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces chewed at school as follows:

Number of pieces chewed at school = (8 hours / 2 hours) = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, resulting in an additional 2 pieces chewed.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, we can calculate the number of pieces Jim has left after chewing 6 pieces:

Initial number of pieces = 20
Number of pieces chewed = 6
Number of pieces left = Initial number of pieces - Number of pieces chewed
= 20 - 6
= 14

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Since half of 14 is 7, he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Number of pieces left = 14 - 7
= 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can utilize a simple arithmetic approach. Given that she will be 16 years old in 12 years, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

Let's denote Charmaine's current age as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

x + 12 = 16

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

x = 16 - 12
x = 4

Now, to find Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can add 4 to her current age:

Age 4 years from now = x + 4
= 4 + 4
= 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in expenditure between the two coaches, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total amount spent by each coach. The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of 9 × $3 = $27. 

Similarly, the basketball coach acquired 8 basketballs at $14 each, yielding a total expenditure of 8 × $14 = $112.

The difference in expenditure between the two coaches can be found by subtracting the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85.

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by this fraction.

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. This can be achieved by dividing the given speed by 1000, as 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

Let's perform the conversion:

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can further convert the speed to Mb per hour by multiplying by 60:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. The tow truck pulled 10 cars per day for the first three days, resulting in a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cars. For the remaining four days, the truck pulled 6 cars per day, yielding a total of 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

The total number of cars towed that week is the sum of these two quantities: 30 + 24 = 54 cars.

"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to meet the minimum height requirement, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years as 't'. Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, his height after 't' years can be represented as:

Height = Initial Height + (Annual Growth Rate * Time)
Height = 40 + 2t

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 48 inches. Setting up an equation to find the time it takes for Adam to reach this height:

40 + 2t = 48

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

2t = 8

Dividing both sides by 2:

t = 4

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we must first determine the profit per vehicle. The company's acquisition cost is 30% of the vehicle's price, which can be expressed as 0.3 * $25,000. This yields a cost of $7,500 per vehicle.

The profit per vehicle is the selling price minus the acquisition cost, which is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 vehicles, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

James' commission is 10% of the total profit, which can be calculated as 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James' total earnings are $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can calculate this as 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which equals 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total price of the three jewels, we can utilize a systematic approach to calculate each jewel's price based on the given information.

Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S. We are provided with the following information:

1. The price of the gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewel: G = (4/5)D
2. The cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel: S = G - $400
3. The price of the diamond jewel is $2000: D = $2000

We can substitute the value of D into the equation for G to find the price of the gold jewel:

G = (4/5)D
= (4/5)($2000)
= $1600

Next, we can substitute the value of G into the equation for S to find the price of the silver jewel:

S = G - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

Now, we can calculate the total price of all three jewels by adding the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = D + G + S
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the expression for T from equation (2) into equation (3) to find the number of rose stamps in terms of S:

R = (S + 3) - 9
R = S - 6

Now, we can express the total number of stamps as the sum of the individual types:

Total = S + T + R
Total = S + (S + 3) + (S - 6)
Total = 3S - 3

Substituting the given value of S = 16, we get:

Total = 3(16) - 3
Total = 48 - 3
Total = 45

Therefore, Max bought 45 stamps in total."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Since they are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed as the difference between their speeds.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T. We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We are also given that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, which can be expressed as D = N - 6. Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Furthermore, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3. Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class. 

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as $C and the maximum cost per class as $x. We are given that C = $60 and x = $10. 

We can calculate the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for by dividing the total cost by the maximum cost per class:

C/x = 60/10 = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for:

Maximum number of classes he can miss = 6 - 10 = -4

However, since Manny cannot miss a negative number of classes, we can conclude that his parents will not sign him up again after he misses 4 classes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total weekly production, we can utilize the concept of combined work rates. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague, Jewel, we can express their work rates as a ratio. Let's denote Jewel's work rate as r customers per day. Then, Julie's work rate is 2r customers per day.

The combined work rate of both Jewel and Julie is the sum of their individual work rates, which is r + 2r = 3r customers per day.

We are given that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3r = 50 to find Jewel's work rate.

Solving for r, we get r = 50 / 3 ≈ 16.67 customers per day.

Now that we have Jewel's work rate, we can find Julie's work rate, which is 2r ≈ 2 * 16.67 ≈ 33.33 customers per day.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual work rates, which is 50 (Jewel) + 33.33 (Julie) ≈ 83.33 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily production by 7, resulting in 83.33 * 7 ≈ 583.31 customers per week.

The final answer is: 583.31"
"To determine the distance Lynn ran, we can utilize the information provided about the relative distances covered by Reggie and Paisley. Let's denote the distance Lynn ran as 'L'. Given that Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, we can express Reggie's distance as 5P, where P = 4 miles. Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can write the equation 5P = L + 3.

Substituting P = 4 into the equation, we get 5(4) = L + 3, which simplifies to 20 = L + 3.

Solving for L, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation, yielding L = 20 - 3 = 17.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. 

First, we need to find the cost per unit of each fruit. The cost of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30, and the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by multiplying the cost per unit by the quantity and adding them together:

Cost of 5 apples = 5 x $1.30 = $6.50
Cost of 5 oranges = 5 x $1.10 = $5.50
Total cost = $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

However, this calculation only accounts for the cost of the fruits and does not consider the total cost of the items as stated in the problem. To find the total cost, we need to multiply the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges by their respective prices and add them together:

Total cost = (5 x $5.20) + (5 x $3.30) = $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

The final answer is: $42.50"
"To determine the time required to dig the hole, we can calculate the volume of the hole using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the volume by the time per cubic foot:

Time = Volume * time per cubic foot
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we can break down the costs of each feature and calculate the total.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade adds $7,500, resulting in a subtotal of $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500. 

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Adding this to the subtotal yields $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000.

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so their cost is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The updated subtotal is $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000.

Finally, the upgraded exterior light package adds $1,500 to the subtotal, resulting in a total cost of $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500.

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new annual salary, we can break down the problem into two components: the raise and the bonus.

First, we calculate the raise: 5% of $20,000 = 0.05 × $20,000 = $1,000. This represents a monthly increase in Tim's salary.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary: $20,000 / 12 = $1,666.67. This represents a one-time payment.

To find Tim's new monthly salary, we add the raise and the bonus to his original salary: $20,000 + $1,000 + $1,666.67 = $22,666.67.

Finally, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12 to find Tim's new annual salary: $22,666.67 × 12 = $272,000.

The final answer is: $272,000"
"To calculate the total cost of James' purchase, we can break down the costs of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we can utilize the concept of linear multiplication to determine the daily and monthly production rates of each website. 

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles per day, while its sister company publishes an average of 10 articles per day. To find the total number of articles published in February, we can multiply the daily production rate of each website by the number of days in the month (28).

Let's calculate the total number of articles published by each website:

News website: 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles
Sister company: 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we can add the total number of articles published by both websites to determine the overall production for the month:

Total articles = 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can analyze the given information using a system of linear equations. Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as T, and his son's wife's age as X.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. S = 60 (Steve's age)
2. W = S + 4 (Steve's wife is 4 years older than him)
3. T = W/2 (Their son is half as old as his mom)
4. X = T - 3 (Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to find T:
T = (S + 4)/2
T = (60 + 4)/2
T = 64/2
T = 32

Now, we can substitute T into equation (4) to find X:
X = T - 3
X = 32 - 3
X = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag as 8 * 2 kilograms. 

Multiplying this result by 3, representing the number of bags, yields a total of 3 * 8 * 2 kilograms.

The calculation can be expressed as: 3 * 8 * 2 = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total time required to dig the well, we can employ the concept of combined work rates. Let's denote the time it takes to dig through the soil as t_s and the time it takes to dig through the clay as t_c. We are given that Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that rate, 2 feet/hour, through clay.

We can express the time it takes to dig through the soil as t_s = 24 / 4 = 6 hours, and the time it takes to dig through the clay as t_c = 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

The total time required to dig the well is the sum of the time spent digging through the soil and the time spent digging through the clay: t_total = t_s + t_c = 6 + 4 = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time required to dig the well is 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should purchase, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Since he wants to acquire one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

Let's denote the number of cupcakes for Howie, his teacher, and each classmate as 'x'. Since he wants to buy one of each flavor, the total number of cupcakes can be represented as:

Total cupcakes = (x + x + x) * 3

Since he wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each of these individuals, we can rewrite the equation as:

Total cupcakes = (2 + 2 + 2) * 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total cupcakes = 6 * 3

Total cupcakes = 18

Therefore, Howie should buy 18 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the initial number of likes. Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can set up the equation:

Initial likes + 20000 = 70 * Initial likes

Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. Then, the equation becomes:

x + 20000 = 70x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

20000 = 69x

Dividing both sides by 69 yields:

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.52

Since the number of likes must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a like.

x = 288

Now, we can calculate the total number of likes by adding the initial likes and the 20000 new likes:

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 288 + 20000
Total likes = 20128

The final answer is 20128."
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we can calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days using the given information.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount. The total cost on Tuesday can be calculated as:

Total Cost (Tuesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= (20 * $20) - $2
= $400 - $2
= $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost on Wednesday can be calculated as:

Total Cost (Wednesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
= (20 * $30) - (0.1 * $600)
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total Cost (Tuesday) - Total Cost (Wednesday)
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red Hat Sales = 1/2 x Green Hat Sales
$400 = 1/2 x Green Hat Sales
Green Hat Sales = 2 x $400
Green Hat Sales = $800

Next, we can calculate the total sales in the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:
Total Sales (Month 1) = Red Hat Sales + Green Hat Sales
Total Sales (Month 1) = $400 + $800
Total Sales (Month 1) = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as:
Total Sales (Month 2) = 3/4 x Total Sales (Month 1)
Total Sales (Month 2) = 3/4 x $1200
Total Sales (Month 2) = $900

Finally, we can find the total sales in two months by adding the sales from both months:
Total Sales (Two Months) = Total Sales (Month 1) + Total Sales (Month 2)
Total Sales (Two Months) = $1200 + $900
Total Sales (Two Months) = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we can employ a straightforward calculation. James's rental period spans from 5 PM to 9 PM, encompassing a total of 4 hours. However, he is entitled to a complimentary hour, thus reducing the number of paid hours to 3.

The cost structure for the rental is as follows: the first paid hour incurs a fixed charge of $15, while each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the initial hour. Therefore, the cost for the remaining 2 hours can be calculated as 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is the sum of the cost for the first paid hour and the cost for the remaining 2 hours, which is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can apply basic algebraic principles. Let's denote the amount withheld as x. We know that Sally's initial bank account balance was $200, and it increased to $420 after the week. Her weekly wage is $300. The increase in her bank account balance can be represented as the difference between her wage and the amount withheld.

The equation can be set up as follows:

Initial bank account balance + Amount withheld = Final bank account balance
$200 + x = $420

To solve for x, we subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:

x = $420 - $200
x = $220

However, this represents the amount Sally's bank account balance increased by, not the amount withheld from her wage. To find the amount withheld, we need to subtract the increase in her bank account balance from her weekly wage:

Amount withheld = Weekly wage - Increase in bank account balance
= $300 - $220
= $80

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that Lori needs 1 whole egg to produce 2 deviled egg halves, we can establish a ratio of eggs to deviled egg halves as 1:2.

Let's denote the number of deviled egg halves needed as 'x'. Since each guest will consume 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves required is 3 * 16 = 48.

To find the total number of eggs needed, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2, as each egg yields 2 halves. Therefore, the total number of eggs required is 48 / 2 = 24.

To express this in dozens, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen. Hence, the total dozens of eggs needed is 24 / 12 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 1 by 3: 1/3 = 0.33.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 0.33 × 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that Mike plans to read 10 pages per day, we can calculate the total number of days required to complete the 200-page book as follows:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can calculate the number of days before the deadline as follows:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline.

"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we must consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the compounding effect of these costs over the 12-month period.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. The monthly rent for the hangar is $5,000, and the monthly fuel cost is twice the rent, which is $10,000. Therefore, the total monthly cost can be represented as:

Total Monthly Cost = Rent + Fuel Cost
= $5,000 + $10,000
= $15,000

To find the total cost for the first year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12:

Total Yearly Cost = Total Monthly Cost x 12
= $15,000 x 12
= $180,000

The total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year is $180,000.

The final answer is: $180,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes and P = R + 20. Additionally, we know that B = (P + R) / 2.

Substituting the value of P into the equation for B, we get B = ((R + 20) + R) / 2. Simplifying this expression, we have B = (2R + 20) / 2 = R + 10.

Now, we can express the total cooking time as the sum of the individual cooking times: Total Time = R + P + B. Substituting the expressions for P and B, we get Total Time = R + (R + 20) + (R + 10) = 3R + 30.

Substituting the given value of R = 30, we find that Total Time = 3(30) + 30 = 90 + 30 = 120 minutes.

"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can calculate the cost of each component and then find the difference.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as A and the cost of walnuts as W. We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. To find the total cost of this mixture, we can use the weighted average formula:

Cost of mixture 1 = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
= (1/2)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 5 + 5
= $10

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. Using the same formula:

Cost of mixture 2 = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
= (1/5)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 2 + 5
= $7

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

Difference in cost = Cost of mixture 1 - Cost of mixture 2

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, and the total number of animal heads is 20.

We can set up the following system of equations:

4s + 2g = 70  (Equation 1: Total number of animal legs)
s + g = 20  (Equation 2: Total number of animal heads)

To solve for 's', we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we can isolate 'g' in Equation 2 and substitute it into Equation 1.

Rearranging Equation 2 to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into Equation 1, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the coffee and donut, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate the cost as follows:

Let x be the cost of the normal brand per pound. Then, the cost of the more expensive brand is x + 0.20x = 1.20x.

Since the more expensive brand costs $6 per pound, we can set up the equation:

1.20x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.20:

x = 6 / 1.20
x = 5

So, the normal brand costs $5 per pound.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee:

7 pounds x $5 per pound = $35

Next, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

Total cost = $35 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $37

Therefore, the total cost is $37.

Final answer: $37"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. The costs of the items he purchased, excluding the apple pie, are as follows:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

The total cost of these items is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract this amount from the total spent:

$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers and the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C are known, we can calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 198 + 209 = 600

Combining like terms, we get:

x + 407 = 600

Subtracting 407 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 600 - 407

x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can express this as a product of the number of times the class meets per week and the duration of each class session:

Total hours = (Number of times the class meets per week) × (Duration of each class session)
Total hours = 4 × 2
Total hours = 8 hours

Next, we can calculate the total number of recipes John learns by dividing the total number of hours by the duration of each recipe learning session (1.5 hours):

Number of recipes = Total hours ÷ Duration of each recipe learning session
Number of recipes = 8 ÷ 1.5
Number of recipes = 5.33

Since we cannot learn a fraction of a recipe, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to consider that John learns 5.33 recipes, as he will have learned 5 full recipes and a portion of another.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.33}$"
"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the number of math teachers, which can be obtained by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360 hours

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"To determine the amount of money each individual would have if they decided to share their funds equally, we can start by calculating the amount of money each person has.

Given that Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as 3/4 times Aurelia's amount: (3/4) * 120 = 90 dollars.

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna's amount is 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money by adding the individual amounts: 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.

To find the amount each person would have if they shared the total equally, we divide the total amount by 3: 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.

Therefore, each person would have $120.

"To determine the amount of candy each individual would receive when pooling their candy, we must first calculate the total amount of candy. This can be achieved by summing the individual amounts:

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds
Total candy = 12 pounds

Since they wish to share the candy equally among themselves, we divide the total amount by the number of individuals (3):

Candy per person = Total candy / Number of individuals
Candy per person = 12 pounds / 3
Candy per person = 4 pounds

Therefore, each individual would receive 4 pounds of candy."
"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased. The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 × $0.5 = $3.50, and the cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 × $0.75 = $7.50. The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received can be calculated as follows:

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
= $15 - $11
= $4

Therefore, Adam received $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can employ a straightforward approach by analyzing the given information.

Let's break down the data:

1. Christina's mood records span 30 days, consisting of 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the remaining days being neutral.
2. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the subsequent 8 days were neutral.
3. The next 3 days are specified as good, neutral, and good, respectively.

We can calculate the number of good days left by subtracting the total number of good days accounted for from the total number of days in the month.

First, we need to determine the number of neutral days. Since the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the subsequent 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, we can find the number of good days left by subtracting the total number of good days accounted for from the total number of days in the month:

Total good days accounted for = 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15
Good days left = Total days - Total good days accounted for
Good days left = 30 - 15
Good days left = 15

However, this calculation is incorrect, as it does not account for the fact that the first 8 good days and the next 3 good days are already included in the total good days. To correct this, we need to subtract the number of good days already accounted for from the total good days:

Good days already accounted for = 12 (initial good days) + 3 (additional good days) = 15
Good days left = Total good days - Good days already accounted for
Good days left = 12 - 3
Good days left = 9

The correct answer is (C)."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of days required for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we convert the target height from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches per day. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the target height of 600 inches is equivalent to 600 / 12 = 50 feet.

Next, we calculate the total growth required, which is the difference between the target height and the current height: 50 feet - 20 feet = 30 feet.

Now, we convert the growth required from feet to inches: 30 feet * 12 inches/foot = 360 inches.

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to reach the target height by dividing the total growth required by the growth rate: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can employ a step-by-step approach, considering the changing number of dogs and the subsequent adjustments in the required number of toys.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, resulting in 1 toy per dog. With 8 additional dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog requires one toy, James initially needs 12 toys.

However, upon returning, he finds that 3 dogs have left, reducing the number of dogs to 12 - 3 = 9. Consequently, James no longer needs the toys for the 3 absent dogs. Therefore, he requires 9 toys for the remaining 9 dogs.

To calculate the total number of toys James needs, we can use the following equation:

Total Toys = Initial Toys + Additional Toys

Since James initially had 4 toys and needed 12, but only 9 are required now, he needs to purchase 9 - 4 = 5 additional toys.

Total Toys = 12 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 17

Therefore, James requires a total of 17 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate Dylan's investment, which is 2/5 of the total amount of $1200. This can be expressed as:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) × $1200
= (2/5) × 1200
= (2 × 1200) / 5
= 2400 / 5
= $480

Next, we find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment by subtracting his share from the total:
Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
= $1200 - $480
= $720

Then, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount:
Frances' investment = (2/3) × $720
= (2 × 720) / 3
= 1440 / 3
= $480

Finally, we determine Skyler's investment by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount:
Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances' investment
= $720 - $480
= $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of signatures they have already collected: 
Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Next, we subtract the number of signatures they already have from their goal of 100 signatures: 
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine Karen's earnings, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Karen earns twice the hourly wage of Lorie, who earns $10 per hour, we can express Karen's hourly wage as 2 * $10 = $20.

Since Karen works 3 hours per day for 2 days, her total earnings can be calculated as:

$20 * 3 hours/day * 2 days = $120

Therefore, Karen's total earnings over the specified period are $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns

To find the number of hash browns that can be produced from 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion and solve for the unknown quantity:

(6 potatoes / 36 hash browns) = (96 potatoes / x hash browns)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

6x = 96 * 36

Simplifying the equation:

6x = 3456

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to produce 576 hash browns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{576}$"
"To determine the excess weight of the 9 adults in the elevator, we can calculate the total weight of the group and compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 9 adults is:

Total weight = 9 × 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg, we can find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The elevator's maximum load capacity is exceeded by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can employ a linear algebraic approach by setting up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:
- K = Katarina's cookies
- M = Max's cookies
- C = Cookie Monster's cookies
- S = Summer's cookies

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23

We are also given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can substitute this value into equation (1) to find Max's cookies:
M = K + 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we have Max's cookies, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies using equation (2):
C = M - 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find Summer's cookies using equation (3):
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

To find the total number of cookies, we can sum the individual amounts:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can employ algebraic techniques to solve for the unknown variable. Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which can be represented as 0.5x. This extension is then added to the original length, resulting in a new length of x + 0.5x = 1.5x. Additionally, a 20cm lace trim is added to the bottom of the dress.

Given that the final length of the dress is 140cm, we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To isolate x, we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as $t_{turtle}$ and in ""rabbit"" mode as $t_{rabbit}$. We are given that $t_{turtle} = 60$ minutes and $t_{rabbit} = 40$ minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can set up the following equation:

$\frac{1}{2}t_{turtle} + \frac{1}{2}t_{rabbit} = t_{total}$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$\frac{1}{2}(60) + \frac{1}{2}(40) = t_{total}$

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$30 + 20 = t_{total}$

$50 = t_{total}$

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to reach school without being late, we can calculate the time elapsed and subtract it from the total available time.

Given that it takes them 6 minutes to reach the corner and an additional 13 minutes to reach the fire station, the total time spent so far is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

The total available time is 30 minutes. To find the remaining time, we subtract the time spent from the total available time:

Time left = Total time available - Time spent
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes to reach school without being late."
"To determine the total cost of Catherine's grocery purchase, we can apply the principle of linear summation. 

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4, and the cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4. Similarly, the cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6. 

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding these values together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a basic arithmetic problem involving the addition and subtraction of whole numbers. To determine the number of cookies left in the box, we can follow a straightforward approach.

First, we calculate the total number of cookies baked by adding the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, we can express this as:

Total cookies baked = Greta's cookies + 2 × Greta's cookies
= 30 + 2 × 30
= 30 + 60
= 90 cookies

Next, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by the pair from the total number of cookies baked to find the number of cookies left in the box:

Cookies left in the box = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
= 90 - 10
= 80 cookies

Therefore, there are 80 cookies left in the box.

The final answer is: 80"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 14.

We are given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-evaluate the problem again.

Let's re-examine the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-evaluate the problem again.

Let's re-examine the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-evaluate the problem again.

Let's re-examine the equation:

"To determine the available time for John to nap, we must first convert the time constraint for dinner into minutes. Given that there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the available time as follows:

Available time = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total time required for John's homework. The time allocated for each subject is as follows:

- Math: 20 minutes
- Reading: 40 minutes
- History: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we can calculate the available time for John to nap by subtracting the total homework time from the available time:

Available time for napping = Available time - Total homework time
= 180 minutes - 80 minutes
= 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available to nap."
"To determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two separate components: the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies.

The cost of 10 lollipops can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one lollipop ($0.40) by 10:

10 × $0.40 = $4.00

The cost of 10 candies can be calculated by multiplying the cost of one candy ($3.20) by 10:

10 × $3.20 = $32.00

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies:

$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we can calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Let's denote Rong's monthly savings as R and Neil's monthly savings as N. We are given that R = 20 coins and N = R + (2/5)R = 20 + (2/5)(20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins.

The total number of coins Rong saves in a year is given by 12R, and the total number of coins Neil saves in a year is given by 12N. We can express this as:

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 10(12R) = 10(12)(20) = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 10(12N) = 10(12)(28) = 3360 coins

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:

Total coins = 10(12R) + 10(12N) = 10(12)(20) + 10(12)(28) = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

Therefore, Rong and Neil have a total of 5760 coins after 10 years.

Final answer: 5760"
"To determine the total cost of the vaccines, we can calculate the cost of two vaccines and then find the cost of the heartworm check. The cost of two vaccines is $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 0.6x = 40. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

The total bill is $66.67. To find out how much John leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought with him:
$125 - $66.67 = $58.33

The final answer is: $58.33"
"To determine the total cost of the crate, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the cost of one banana as B, the cost of one apple as A, and the cost of one orange as O.

Given that one apple costs $0.5, we can express the cost of one banana as B = 2A, and the cost of one orange as O = 3B. Substituting B = 2A into the expression for O, we get O = 3(2A) = 6A.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the crate by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its respective cost and summing the results:

Total Cost = (5B) + (12A) + (7O)
= (5(2A)) + (12A) + (7(6A))
= 10A + 12A + 42A
= 64A

Given that one apple costs $0.5, we can substitute A = $0.5 into the expression for Total Cost:

Total Cost = 64A
= 64($0.5)
= $32

Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $32.

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we can analyze the given information about the number of colored squares.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following relationships:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can express B, G, and W in terms of R:

B = R + 4
G = (R + 4) + 6
G = R + 10
W = (R + 10) - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can express the total number of squares in terms of R:

Total = R + B + G + W
Total = R + (R + 4) + (R + 10) + (R - 2)
Total = 4R + 12

Since we know R = 14, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Total = 4(14) + 12
Total = 56 + 12
Total = 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs required, we must first establish the total number of chairs needed. Given that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, we can calculate the total number of chairs required as follows:

Total number of attendees = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Total number of chairs required = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

To find the number of additional chairs required, we subtract the existing number of chairs from the total number of chairs needed:

Additional chairs required = Total number of chairs required - Number of existing chairs

"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given percentages. 

First, we need to calculate the number of bucks, which constitutes 50% of the total deer population. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of deer by 0.5.

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Next, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks by taking 20% of the number of bucks.

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points required for the class to go on the trip, we need to calculate the points for each student and then sum them up.

Let's denote Adam's points as A, Betty's points as B, Marta's points as M, and Tom's points as T. We are given the following information:

A = 50
B = A + 0.3A = 1.3A
M = 3T
T = B - 30

We can substitute the value of T in terms of A:
M = 3(B - 30)
M = 3B - 90

Now, we can express B in terms of A:
B = 1.3A
M = 3(1.3A) - 90
M = 3.9A - 90

Now, we can express the total points in terms of A:
Total points = A + B + M + T
Total points = A + 1.3A + (3.9A - 90) + (B - 30)
Total points = A + 1.3A + 3.9A - 90 + B - 30
Total points = 6.2A + B - 120

Substituting the value of B in terms of A:
Total points = 6.2A + 1.3A - 120
Total points = 7.5A - 120

We are given that the minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find the total points required, we can set up the equation:
7.5A - 120 = 400

Solving for A:
7.5A = 400 + 120
7.5A = 520
A = 520 / 7.5
A = 69.33

Now that we have the value of A, we can calculate the total points:
Total points = 7.5A - 120
Total points = 7.5(69.33) - 120
Total points = 522.5 - 120
Total points = 402.5

The class is missing 400 - 402.5 = 2.5 points to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points."
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ a combinatorial approach. We start with the initial number of children, which is 3. Each of these children gives birth to 3 offspring, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. 

Since each of these 9 grandchildren also has 3 children of their own, we can apply the multiplication principle to find the total number of great grand-babies. This yields 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can express this as a mathematical expression: 15 × 20.

The total number of fireworks in the city is 15 × 20 = 300.

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300. This can be expressed as 0.4 × 300.

The number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city is 0.4 × 300 = 120.

Next, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so we can express this as 3 × 5.

The total number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard is 3 × 5 = 15.

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see.

The total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135.

"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of individuals, drinks, and snacks, and then multiplying these quantities by their respective costs.

Given that Aiden and 12 of his friends are initially present, and 7 more friends join them, the total number of individuals is 12 + 7 = 19.

Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks, so the total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38, and the total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76, and the total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy. We are given that G = 4,000 pounds and Gd = G + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds, so we can set up the equation: G + Gd + Gy = 11,600.

Substituting the known values, we get: 4,000 + 4,800 + Gy = 11,600.

Simplifying the equation, we have: 8,800 + Gy = 11,600.

Subtracting 8,800 from both sides yields: Gy = 2,800.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2,800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'x'. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate can be represented as (x + 1).

We are given that there are 8 males and 6 females. Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(x + 1), and the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6x.

Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females must be equal to the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry. This can be expressed as:

8(x + 1) + 6x = Total dumplings cooked by Larry

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x + 8 + 6x = Total dumplings cooked by Larry
14x + 8 = Total dumplings cooked by Larry

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

14(3) + 8 = Total dumplings cooked by Larry
42 + 8 = Total dumplings cooked by Larry
50 = Total dumplings cooked by Larry

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

Final answer: 50"
"To determine the amount of money Gerald has left after spending $10, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that the total amount of money is $100 and the ratio of Gerald's share to Julia's share is 3:2, we can calculate his initial amount as follows:

Let's denote Gerald's share as 3x and Julia's share as 2x. Since the total amount is $100, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know x, we can find Gerald's initial amount:

Gerald's initial amount = 3x = 3(20) = 60

"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that the turtle's speed is 1/5 that of the cat's, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Speed of the turtle = 1/5 × Speed of the cat
Speed of the turtle = 1/5 × 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we can employ a simple division-based approach. Given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, we can calculate the hourly fundraising rate as follows:

Hourly fundraising rate = Total amount raised / Total hours worked
= $2100 / 3 hours
= $700 per hour

Now, we can calculate the remaining amount they need to raise to reach their goal:

Remaining amount = Total goal - Amount already raised
= $6300 - $2100
= $4200

To find the number of hours required to raise the remaining amount, we can divide the remaining amount by the hourly fundraising rate:

Number of hours required = Remaining amount / Hourly fundraising rate
= $4200 / $700 per hour
= 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. Given that the city utilizes 40% of the river's water and 80% of this amount is allocated for industrial purposes, we can express this as:

Industrial water usage = 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Next, we can calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the industrial usage from 100%:

Non-industrial water usage = 100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, the city uses 68% of the Colorado River's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we can model the production rates of the chocolate and vanilla ice cream factories as linear functions of time. Let's denote the number of quarts produced by the chocolate factory as C(t) and the number of quarts produced by the vanilla factory as V(t), where t is the time in hours.

Given that the chocolate factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours, we can express its production rate as C(t) = 50t. Similarly, the vanilla factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its production rate can be expressed as V(t) = 12.5t.

To find the total number of quarts produced in 48 hours, we can integrate the production rates of both factories over the given time period:

Total quarts = ∫[0, 48] C(t) dt + ∫[0, 48] V(t) dt
= ∫[0, 48] 50t dt + ∫[0, 48] 12.5t dt
= [25t^2] from 0 to 48 + [6.25t^2] from 0 to 48
= 25(48)^2 - 25(0)^2 + 6.25(48)^2 - 6.25(0)^2
= 25(2304) + 6.25(2304)
= 57600 + 14400
= 72000

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 72000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we can employ the principle of additive aggregation, where the cost of each item is summed to obtain the total cost. 

The total cost of the items can be calculated as follows:

5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 × $3.00 = $15.00
4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 × $2.50 = $10.00
3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 × $4.00 = $12.00
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 × $1.00 = $13.00

The total cost is the sum of these individual costs: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

$50.00 × 0.10 = $5.00

The total bill after the discount is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

The final answer is $45.00."
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can apply the concept of fractional analysis. Given that the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can model this as a fractional relationship. 

Let's denote the number of scoops Erin buys as x. Since she gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she purchases, the total cost can be represented as 1.5x. 

We know that Erin has $6.00, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 6 ÷ 1.5
x = 4

However, this calculation represents the total number of scoops Erin can afford, not the number of scoops she should buy. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" Erin can effectively get 3 scoops for the price of 2. 

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 scoops to take advantage of the deal.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days. 

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. 

Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two-thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 square foot bathroom, we can employ the concept of proportional reasoning. 

First, we need to calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet. This can be achieved by multiplying 36 by the fraction 2/3:

(2/3) * 36 = 24

Since Mr. Boarden requires 24 tiles per square foot, we can then multiply the result by 24 to obtain the total number of tiles needed:

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To determine James' savings, we can calculate the cost of picking and buying blueberries separately and then compare them.

The cost of picking blueberries can be represented as a linear function of the weight of the blueberries picked, with an initial fixed cost of $20 and an additional cost of $1.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries is:

C_picking = 20 + 1.5 * 30
C_picking = 20 + 45
C_picking = 65

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is a constant $2.5 per pound, so the total cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries is:

C_buying = 2.5 * 30
C_buying = 75

To find James' savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:

Savings = C_buying - C_picking
Savings = 75 - 65
Savings = 10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we can utilize the concept of percentage increase. The original price of each computer was $700, and the price increased by 10%. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

New price = Original price + (Original price * Percentage increase)
= $700 + ($700 * 0.10)
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers:

Total amount = New price * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid for the computers is $385,000.

First, we need to identify the number of calories contributed by each component: eggs, cheese, and ham. Given that eggs are 75 calories each, six eggs will contribute 6 * 75 = 450 calories. The cheese, with 120 calories per ounce, will contribute 2 * 120 = 240 calories. Lastly, the ham, with 40 calories per ounce, will contribute 2 * 40 = 80 calories.

To determine the total calories in the omelet, we can sum the calories from each component: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The omelet contains 770 calories."
"To determine the change received after purchasing 6 pencils and 8 erasers, we can calculate the total cost of the items and subtract it from the amount paid.

The cost of pencils can be calculated as 6 * $0.50 = $3.
The cost of erasers can be calculated as 8 * $0.25 = $2.
The total cost of the items is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the amount paid was $10, the change received can be calculated as $10 - $5 = $5.

Therefore, the change received is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can apply the given percentages sequentially.

First, we calculate the number of individuals who receive interviews: 30% of 100 applicants.

Let's denote the total number of applicants as N. The number of individuals who receive interviews is then 0.3N.

Next, we calculate the number of individuals who receive a job offer from those who were interviewed. This is 20% of the number of individuals who received interviews.

The number of individuals who receive a job offer is then 0.2 * 0.3N = 0.06N.

Finally, we calculate the number of individuals who accept the position from those who received a job offer. This is one-third of the number of individuals who received a job offer.

The number of individuals who accept the position is then (1/3) * 0.06N = 0.02N.

Since we know that N = 100, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the number of individuals who accept the position.

0.02N = 0.02 * 100 = 2

Therefore, the number of people who accept the position is 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total weight of rice Goldy gave away, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of sacks given away: 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which equals 3 + 4 = 7 sacks.

Next, we multiply the total number of sacks by the weight of each sack, which is 25 kilograms. This results in 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms.

Therefore, Goldy gave away 175 kilograms of rice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of boxes of cereal Castle bought this week and last week, we can employ a simple arithmetic operation. 

Let's denote the number of boxes of Coco Crunch as C and the number of boxes of Fruit Loops as F. We are given that Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. Therefore, the total number of boxes of cereal she bought this week is C + F = 3 + 5 = 8.

Similarly, we are given that she bought 4 boxes of cereal last week. To find the difference, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week: 8 - 4 = 4.

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we can break down the problem into two distinct scenarios: one for the time her arms are raised and the other for the time they are not.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for each foot when her arms are raised as $a$ and when they are at her sides as $b$. We are given that $a = 200$ taps/minute for each foot. The combined taps per minute when her arms are raised is $2a = 400$ taps/minute. 

We can calculate the number of taps for the first 2 minutes when her arms are raised as $2 \times 400 = 800$ taps. For the remaining 3 minutes, her taps per minute are $b = 550$ taps/minute. Therefore, the number of taps for the remaining 3 minutes is $3 \times 550 = 1650$ taps.

The total number of taps Helga performs during the 5-minute dance is the sum of the taps during the two time periods: $800 + 1650 = 2450$ taps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we can calculate the total cost of the alternative scenario (i.e., not fixing the pothole) and compare it to the cost of fixing the pothole.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is $450, which represents the potential damage to Ron's vehicle. However, this amount does not account for the additional costs associated with the fine and the materials required for the repair. 

The city council's fine for unauthorized road maintenance is $120, and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, each priced at $25, is $75. Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 (damage to the car) + $120 (fine) + $75 (asphalt) = $645.

To find the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the cost of not fixing it: $645 (total cost of fixing the pothole) - $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) = $195.

The amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is $195.

Final answer: $195"
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of chairs initially available: 170 normal chairs + 23 baby chairs = 193 chairs.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair: 20 normal chairs + 13 baby chairs = 33 chairs.

Finally, we subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs initially available to find the number of chairs left: 193 - 33 = 160 chairs.

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we can break down the problem into two parts: the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends, and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends.

First, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, we can express this as:

(2/3) × 12 = 8 slices

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, which can be expressed as:

(3/4) × 12 = 9 slices

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

8 + 9 = 17 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, the number of slices left can be found by subtracting the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:

5 × 12 - 17 = 25

Therefore, the number of slices left is 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the time taken by the cat as C and the time taken by the dog as D. We are given that the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we can express this as:

D = (2/3)C

We are also given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

D = (2/3)(30)
D = 20 minutes

Now, we can calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog:

Average time = (C + D) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we can establish an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = 100

To solve for 'x', we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to isolate 'x':

x = 90 / 9
x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we can calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately and then sum the results.

Let's denote the total number of students' cars as S and the total number of teachers' cars as T. We are given that S = 64 and T = 32.

The number of windows smashed by students is 3/4 of the total number of students' cars, which can be expressed as (3/4)S. Similarly, the number of windows smashed by teachers is 3/4 of the total number of teachers' cars, which can be expressed as (3/4)T.

The total number of windows smashed is the sum of the windows smashed by students and teachers, which can be represented as:

Total windows smashed = (3/4)S + (3/4)T

Substituting the given values for S and T, we get:

Total windows smashed = (3/4)(64) + (3/4)(32)
= 48 + 24
= 72

Therefore, Hannah smashed a total of 72 windows.

Final answer: 72"
"To determine the percentage of blue spools, we can calculate the total number of blue spools and then divide it by the total number of spools, finally converting the result to a percentage.

First, we calculate the total number of blue spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60.

Next, we calculate the total number of spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools: (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday, which is 2/5 of the total number of people (5000). This can be represented as:

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

Next, we find the number of people remaining after midday by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Then, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00, which is 2/3 of the remaining people:

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

Finally, we determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people remaining:

5000 - 2000 - 2000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can employ a simple division operation. 

Let's denote the number of days as 'd' and the number of pieces of gum per pack as 'p'. We are given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day (d = 4) and a pack has 15 pieces of gum (p = 15). We want to find the number of packs required to last 30 days (n).

The total number of pieces of gum required for 30 days can be calculated as:

Total pieces = d * p
Total pieces = 4 * 15
Total pieces = 60

Now, we can divide the total number of pieces required by the number of pieces per pack to find the number of packs needed:

n = Total pieces / p
n = 60 / 15
n = 4

Therefore, Parker will need 4 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we must first calculate the total number of s'mores needed. This can be achieved by summing the number of s'mores required for the kids and adults.

Let's denote the number of kids as K and the number of adults as A. We are given that K = 9 and A = 6. The number of s'mores required for each group can be calculated as follows:

Number of s'mores for kids = K * 2 = 9 * 2 = 18
Number of s'mores for adults = A * 1 = 6 * 1 = 6

Total number of s'mores required = 18 + 6 = 24

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we can calculate the number of sleeves required by dividing the total number of s'mores by 8:

Number of sleeves required = Total number of s'mores / 8 = 24 / 8 = 3

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Dora's age as 'D', her father's age as 'F', and her mother's age as 'M'. Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can express this as:

D = 15

We are also given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, which can be represented as:

F = 2D + 8

Substituting D = 15 into the equation, we get:

F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38

Furthermore, we know that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, so we can express this as:

M = F - 4

Substituting F = 38 into the equation, we get:

M = 38 - 4
M = 34

Now, we can calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Combined age = D + F + M
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87

Therefore, the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years."
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can utilize the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of $20 and 4 siblings. The division operation can be represented as:

"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we can utilize the principle of additive weight. Given the weights of each book, we can calculate the total weight by summing the individual weights.

Let's denote the weight of the math and science books as M, the French book as F, the English book as E, and the history book as H. We are provided with the following information:

- M = 2 pounds
- F = 4 pounds
- E = 3 pounds
- H = 2E (twice the weight of the English book)

We can express the weight of the history book in terms of E: H = 2E = 2(3) = 6 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the total weight by adding the weights of all the books: M + F + E + H = 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 15 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of Cindy's books is 15 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can first calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can express this as:

Votes for B = Votes for A + (50% of Votes for A)
Votes for B = 0.2 * 100 + (0.5 * 0.2 * 100)
Votes for B = 20 + 10
Votes for B = 30

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters:

Votes for C = Total votes - (Votes for A + Votes for B)
Votes for C = 100 - (20 + 30)
Votes for C = 100 - 50
Votes for C = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of apples Boris has as B and the initial number of apples Beck has as K.

Given that Boris has 100 apples, we can express this as B = 100. Additionally, we know that Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we can express Beck's initial amount as K = B - 23.

Substituting B = 100 into the equation for K, we get K = 100 - 23 = 77.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. This means Boris now has B - 10 apples, and Beck now has K + 10 apples. We can express this as:

B - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
K + 10 = 77 + 10 = 87

To find the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount:

Difference = (B - 10) - (K + 10) = 90 - 87 = 3

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transaction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water left, we can calculate the total water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used for each type of cube:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of books Clara has more than Alice, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's book count as 2x.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to solve for x. Dividing both sides by 2 yields x = 10, indicating that Steven has 10 books.

Now, we can calculate the number of books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 10 + 6 = 16. 

To find the difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total: 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to establish the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can express this relationship as:

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Next, we can calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars by multiplying the respective quantities by their respective costs and summing the results:

Total cost = (10 * $5) + (16 * $3)
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

Therefore, the total amount Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $98.

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can employ a Venn diagram or a set theory approach. Let's denote the number of students who like to bake as B, the number of students who like to play basketball as C, and the number of students who like to play video games as V.

Given that B = 10, C = 5, and the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, we can express the number of students who like to play music as 2C = 2(5) = 10.

Since the total number of students is 50, we can set up the equation: B + C + V = 50. Substituting the known values, we get 10 + 5 + V = 50.

Solving for V, we have V = 50 - 10 - 5 = 35.

However, we must also consider the students who like to play music. Since 10 students like to play music, and we've already accounted for 15 students (10 who like to bake and 5 who like to play basketball), the remaining students who like to play video games or music are 50 - 15 = 35. This implies that the 10 students who like to play music are part of the 35, so the number of students who like to play video games is indeed 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we need to find the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the initial 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as:

Number of birds scared away = (1/3) * 12
= 12/3
= 4

Next, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds to find the number of birds remaining:

Number of birds remaining = Initial number of birds - Number of birds scared away
= 12 - 4
= 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard, so we add this to the number of birds remaining:

Total number of birds = Number of birds remaining + 20
= 8 + 20
= 28

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Given that the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.

Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. We can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know each class has 40 students, we can calculate the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys in each class = Total number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can employ a step-by-step approach to solve the problem.

Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake. Mara then added 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, she tripled the number of slices, which can be represented as 5 × 3 = 15 slices. 

After Mara ate 2 slices, the number of slices remaining is 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

However, her friend then stole 5 slices, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 slices on the plate.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that she has a total of 28 animals (8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses) that require grooming, we can calculate the daily allocation as follows:

Total number of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week (7):
28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4."
"To calculate Mark's profit, we must first determine the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards. The total cost of the packs can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total Cost = Number of Packs * Cost per Pack
Total Cost = 3 packs * $1800 per pack
Total Cost = $5400

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. This includes the two cards worth $4000 and $1000, as well as the 30 cards worth $50 each. We can express this as:

Total Value = Value of Card 1 + Value of Card 2 + (Number of Cards * Value per Card)
Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50)
Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + $1500
Total Value = $6500

Finally, we can find Mark's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value:

Profit = Total Value - Total Cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we can calculate the total cost of each option and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. The cost of the first amusement park can be represented as 26A + 12C, and the cost of the second amusement park can be represented as 14A + 10C.

Given A = 2 and C = 2, we can substitute these values into the cost equations:

Cost of the first amusement park: 26A + 12C = 26(2) + 12(2) = 52 + 24 = 76
Cost of the second amusement park: 14A + 10C = 14(2) + 10(2) = 28 + 20 = 48

The cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first can be calculated as the difference between the two costs:
Cost savings = (Cost of the first amusement park) - (Cost of the second amusement park)
= 76 - 48
= 28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the vendor's weekly savings, we can calculate the difference in daily costs between the two vendors and then multiply by 7.

The vendor's daily cost savings can be calculated as follows:

Daily cost savings = (Old vendor's cost - New vendor's cost)
= ($0.5 - $0.4)
= $0.1

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily cost savings * 7
= $0.1 * 7
= $0.7

Therefore, the vendor saves $0.7 per day, which translates to $0.7 * 7 = $4.9 per week.

The final answer is: $4.9"
"To determine the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of marbles each individual possesses.

Given that Sean has 56 marbles and that he has half as many marbles as Cal, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Let C represent the number of marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can write the equation: 

56 = (1/2)C

To solve for C, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, yielding: 

C = 56 * 2
C = 112

Now that we know Cal has 112 marbles, we can determine the number of marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can express this relationship as: 

Let C' represent the number of marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we can write the equation: 

C' = 4 * 56
C' = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have, we can add their marbles together: 

Total = C' + C
Total = 224 + 112
Total = 336

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we must first clarify the objective. The question appears to be based on a misunderstanding, as the activity requires 12 groups, not 6. However, assuming the intention was to find the number of groups needed to accommodate 54 students into 6 groups, we can proceed with the calculation.

The number of students per group can be calculated as follows:

54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Since the activity already requires 12 groups, we can determine the total number of students that can be accommodated as follows:

12 groups * 9 students per group = 108 students

However, the actual number of students is 54. To find the number of groups needed to accommodate the actual number of students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

54 students / 9 students per group = 6 groups

Since the activity already has 12 groups, the number of additional groups needed is:

12 groups (required) - 6 groups (available) = 6 groups

Therefore, 6 additional groups are needed to accommodate the actual number of students.

Final answer: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of weekdays and weekend days separately and then sum them up.

Let's break it down:

Number of weekdays in 4 weeks = 5 weekdays/week * 4 weeks = 20 weekdays
Number of weekend days in 4 weeks = 2 weekend days/week * 4 weeks = 8 weekend days

Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday and 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, we can calculate the total number of chairs rented as follows:

Total chairs rented = (Number of weekdays * Chairs rented per weekday) + (Number of weekend days * Chairs rented per weekend day)
Total chairs rented = (20 * 60) + (8 * 100)
Total chairs rented = 1200 + 800
Total chairs rented = 2000

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we can analyze the sequence of events that affected the banana count.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas, reducing the count to 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. This can be expressed as:

48 - (1/2) × 48

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, increasing the count to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. This can be represented as:

24 + 25

Subsequently, Arnold stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas. This can be expressed as:

24 + 25 - 12

Finally, on the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, resulting in a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas. This can be represented as:

24 + 25 - 12 + 6

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity bill per roommate, we can utilize the concept of proportional sharing. Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly share per roommate as follows:

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

To find the yearly share, we can multiply the monthly share by 12:

Yearly share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $25 * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity, assuming the monthly bill remains constant and the roommates divide the share equally.

"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the initial quantities of glasses and plates. Since Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates, we can express this as:

Number of glasses = 8 * 12 = 96
Number of plates = 4 * 12 = 48

Next, we need to account for the broken items. We are given that 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. To find the remaining quantities, we subtract the number of broken items from the initial quantities:

Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86
Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42

Therefore, Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

The final answer is: 86 + 42 = 128"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we can break down the transactions into two separate steps.

First, we calculate the number of small stickers she trades for large buttons. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and she trades 90% of her small stickers, we can express this as:

Number of small stickers traded = 0.9 * 30 = 27

This leaves her with 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.

Next, we calculate the number of large stickers she trades for large buttons. Since she trades 50% of her large stickers, we can express this as:

Number of large stickers traded = 0.5 * 40 = 20

This leaves her with 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.

Now, she trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, we can express this as:

Number of small stickers received = 20 * 3 = 60

Adding the small stickers she already had to the ones she received, we get:

Total small stickers = 3 + 60 = 63

Finally, we add the number of large stickers she has left to the total number of small stickers:

Total buttons = 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of matches played on each day: 
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 2 times the number of matches played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches played by summing the matches played on each day: 
Total matches = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"In the context of collective decision-making, the problem at hand can be modeled using a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

Given that the total number of council members is 33, we can establish the following equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we obtain:

3x = 33

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 33/3

x = 11

Now that we have determined the number of votes against the regulation, we can calculate the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11)

2x = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can employ a systematic approach by breaking down the information provided. Let's denote the number of students requiring each size as follows:

- Let x be the number of students requiring extra-small shirts.
- Then, 2x represents the number of students requiring small shirts.
- The number of students requiring medium shirts can be expressed as 2x - 4.
- The number of students requiring large shirts is half the number of students requiring medium shirts, which is (2x - 4)/2 = x - 2.
- Finally, the number of students requiring extra-large shirts is 6 more than the number of students requiring large shirts, which is (x - 2) + 6 = x + 4.

We are given that the total number of students is the sum of students for each size. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + (2x - 4) + (x - 2) + (x + 4) = total number of students

Combine like terms:

6x - 2 = total number of students

We are also given that there are 11 students requiring extra-small shirts. So, we can substitute x = 11 into the equation:

6(11) - 2 = total number of students
66 - 2 = total number of students
64 = total number of students

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we can apply the formula for percentage decrease:

Final Price = Marked Price - (Marked Price * Discount Percentage)

In this case, the marked price is $140 and the discount percentage is 5% or 0.05 as a decimal.

Final Price = 140 - (140 * 0.05)
Final Price = 140 - 7
Final Price = 133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total duration of the playlists, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that each playlist consists of 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours long, we can calculate the total duration by multiplying the number of playlists by the number of songs per playlist and then by the duration of each song.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total duration = Number of playlists × Number of songs per playlist × Duration of each song
Total duration = 20 × 300 × 10

Using the rules of multiplication, we can simplify this expression as:

Total duration = 20 × 3000
Total duration = 60,000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: 60,000"
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win, which is 20% of 50. This can be expressed as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, we calculate 60% of 40, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The remaining people who think horse #12 will win can be found by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given fractions to establish a relationship between the number of Pomeranians and the total number of puppies.

Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as:

(2/3)x = 6

To isolate 'x', we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2):

x = 6 * (3/2)
x = 9

Therefore, Jana has 9 puppies in total.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Jayden initially has as 'x' and the amount Ava gives him as 'y'. We know that x = $70 and y = $45 (half of Ava's $90 allowance).

The total amount Jayden has after receiving the money from Ava is x + y = $70 + $45 = $115.

The cost of the camera is $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Final Answer: The final answer is $85."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles required for the third house, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the three houses. Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. According to the problem, the second house requires half the amount of the first house, which can be expressed as x/2. The third house, on the other hand, requires double the amount of the first house, which can be represented as 2x.

We are also given that the total number of cases required for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

To solve for x, we can first combine like terms:

(2x + x/2 + 2x) = 250

Multiplying every term by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + x + 4x = 500

Combine like terms:

9x = 500

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 500/9

x = 55.56

Since x represents the number of cases needed for the first house, we can now find the number of cases required for the third house by multiplying x by 2:

Third house cases = 2x
= 2 * 55.56
= 111.12

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the third house will need approximately 111 cases of shingles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{111}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we can calculate the individual costs and sum them up.

Leila's purchase of 3 cucumbers at $2 each can be represented as 3 × $2 = $6.
Jack's purchase of 5 tomatoes at $1 each can be represented as 5 × $1 = $5.
Chase's purchase of 1 head of lettuce at $3 each can be represented as $3.

The total cost is the sum of these individual costs: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

The final answer is: $14"
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we can utilize the concept of percentages and basic arithmetic operations.

Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can express this relationship as:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)

Let's denote the number of bananas as B. Then, the number of pears can be represented as B + 0.45B = 1.45B.

We are given that George has 200 bananas, so B = 200. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Number of pears = 1.45B = 1.45 * 200 = 290

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

The final answer is: 490"
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. Since each candy bar costs $5, the total cost of the candy bars can be represented as 5x. We are given that Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, leaving her with $60. Therefore, the equation to represent the situation is:

5x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 60 / 5
x = 12

Thus, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we can employ the concept of direct proportionality. Given that 5 kilograms of oranges are required to produce 1 liter of juice, we can establish a ratio of oranges to liters as 5 kg : 1 L. 

To find the cost of 4 liters of juice, we can multiply the cost of 1 kilogram of oranges by the number of kilograms required for 4 liters of juice. The cost of 1 kilogram of oranges is $3. Therefore, the total cost of 20 kilograms of oranges (required for 4 liters of juice) is:

$3/kg * 20 kg = $60

Thus, Sam would need to spend $60 to produce 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's break down the information provided:

Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. We are given that Ezra read 300 books in that hour. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2.

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as x. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

300 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 300 / 2
x = 150

Now that we know Ahmed read 150 books, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed by adding the number of books each read:

Total books read = Ezra's books + Ahmed's books
Total books read = 300 + 150
Total books read = 450

Therefore, the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{450}$"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we can calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them.

First, we calculate her earnings for Monday. Since she earns $15 per hour and teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, her total earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Next, we calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She earns $15 per hour and teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total earnings for Wednesday can be calculated as:

2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Since Tanya earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes, we need to verify if she meets this condition on both days. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes, which exceeds the threshold, and on Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which does not exceed the threshold. Therefore, she earns the additional $5 on Monday but not on Wednesday.

Now, we add her earnings for both days, including the additional $5 for Monday:
$60 + $30 + $5 = $95

The final answer is: $95"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

Let's denote the number of vanilla scents sold as V and the number of fruity scents sold as F. We are given that the company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents. Therefore, we can express this information as:

V = 5
F = 2

To find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold, we can subtract the number of fruity scents from the number of vanilla scents:

Difference = V - F
= 5 - 2
= 3

Therefore, the company sold 3 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the optimal selling price for each ear of corn, we can employ a linear programming approach. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as x. We know that Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, resulting in a total revenue of 20 * 3 = $60. His goal is to reach a total revenue of $135 from both eggplants and corn.

The total revenue from eggplants is fixed at $60. To find the revenue from corn, we subtract this amount from the total goal: $135 - $60 = $75. Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, the revenue from corn can be represented as 25x.

We can set up the equation: 25x = $75

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 25:

x = $75 ÷ 25
x = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to achieve his revenue goal.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we must first calculate the total available time for leisure activities. Given that she has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, the total available time is 12 hours.

Tatiana's reading time is 3 hours, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 hours for other activities. She then dedicates 1/3 of this remaining time to video games, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours. Therefore, the time spent playing soccer is 9 - 3 = 6 hours.

To calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we can use the following formula:

Percentage = (Time spent playing soccer / Total weekend time) * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage = (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as follows:

Anthony's initial pencils = 50
Pencils given to Brandon = 1/2 * 50 = 25
Remaining pencils = 50 - 25 = 25

Next, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. This can be calculated as follows:

Remaining pencils after giving to Brandon = 25
Pencils given to Charlie = 3/5 * 25 = 15
Pencils remaining = 25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we can employ the concept of round-trip travel time. Given that Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour (mph) and spends 6 hours at the museum, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Let's denote the one-way distance to the museum as d. Since Jack drives to the museum and back, the total distance traveled is 2d. We are given that the one-way distance is 150 miles, so d = 150 miles. The total distance traveled is therefore 2d = 2(150) = 300 miles.

The time taken to travel to the museum is given by the formula t = d / s, where t is the time, d is the distance, and s is the speed. Substituting the values, we get t = 150 / 75 = 2 hours. Since Jack drives back home, the total time taken for the round trip is 2t = 2(2) = 4 hours.

Adding the time spent at the museum, we get the total time Jack is gone from home: 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"

Total number of wheels required = 4C + 2M
= 4(57) + 2(73)
= 228 + 146
= 374

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374
= 276

Therefore, the number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To calculate the discounted price of the laptop, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The formula for finding the amount of the discount is:

Discount = (Percentage / 100) * Original Price

In this case, the original price of the laptop is $1000, and the discount is 20%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Discount = (20 / 100) * $1000
= 0.20 * $1000
= $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
= $1000 - $200
= $800

Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is $800."
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we can break down the problem into distinct components and apply relevant mathematical operations.

First, we need to calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can express this as:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

The cost of the series can be calculated by multiplying the number of movies in series by the cost of a normal movie, which is $6 less than the cost of a normal movie. Therefore, the cost of the series is:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * ($10 - $6)
= 200 * $4
= $800

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. This can be done by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost of the older movies is:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, we can calculate the cost of the normal movies by multiplying the number of normal movies by the cost of a normal movie, which is $10:

Number of normal movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series - Number of older movies
= 600 - 200 - 160
= 240

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $800 + $800 + $2400
= $4000

The final answer is: $4000"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the principle of linear algebra by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of pounds of peaches, plums, and apricots as P, L, and A, respectively. The cost per pound for each fruit is $2.00, $1.00, and $3.00, respectively.

We are given that Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums, and 6 pounds of apricots. Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations:

P = 6
L = 8
A = 6

The total cost (C) can be represented as the sum of the cost of each type of fruit, which can be expressed as:

C = 2P + L + 3A

Substituting the values of P, L, and A into the equation, we get:

C = 2(6) + 8 + 3(6)
C = 12 + 8 + 18
C = 38

Therefore, Winston spent $38 on fruit.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We are given that the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so d = 50.

The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Therefore, we can express the hiking speed as h = (d/2) - 5.

We are also given that the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can set up the equation:

d * t_d + h * t_h = d * t_d + ((d/2) - 5) * t_h

where t_d is the time spent driving and t_h is the time spent hiking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can write t_d + t_h = 6.

Substituting t_h = 6 - t_d into the equation, we get:

d * t_d + ((d/2) - 5) * (6 - t_d) = d * t_d

Simplifying the equation, we get:

d * t_d + 3d - 30 - (d/2)t_d = d * t_d

Combine like terms:

(3d/2)t_d - 30 = 0

Now, substitute d = 50:

(3(50)/2)t_d - 30 = 0

Solve for t_d:

(75)t_d - 30 = 0

75t_d = 30

t_d = 30/75

t_d = 2/5

Now that we have the time spent driving, we can find the distance traveled while driving:

d * t_d = 50 * (2/5)

d * t_d = 20

The distance to the vacation spot is 20 miles.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can analyze their performance in each category and calculate their respective scores.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We are given the following information:

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy count is 8 + 0 = 8.
2. Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry count is 3 + 5 = 8.
3. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so Ava's time is 30 + 4 = 34 seconds.

Now, we can calculate their scores using the given point values:

Ava's score: 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 34 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 15 + 1020 = 1115

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1115 - 820 = 295.

The final answer is: $\boxed{295}$"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as 'x'. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 34

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"

First, we calculate the total number of times they ride on the usual days, which is 3 times a day for 5 days. This can be represented as 3 * 5 = 15.

Next, we consider the two days when they ride twice the usual amount, which is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days to obtain the overall weekly total:
15 + 12 = 27

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 27 times in a week.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as x.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 14 = -11 (this is not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 3 orange fish and 14 white fish, or 14 orange fish and 3 white fish, but we will use the first option for the solution).

Let's use the first option: 3 orange fish were taken out, and 14 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

0 = 2(-10)

This equation is not true, so we will re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

This equation is not true.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

This equation is not true.

Let's re-evaluate the situation again: Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we must consider the total distance traveled and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Given that the one-way distance between Andy's home and office is 5 miles, the round-trip distance is 10 miles per day. Since Andy commutes from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is:

Total distance = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

The fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). To calculate the amount of gas consumed per week, we can divide the total distance traveled by the fuel efficiency:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles / 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

To determine the cost of gas consumed per week, we can multiply the gas consumed per week by the price of regular gas, which is $3 per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $15

Therefore, Andy's car consumes $15 worth of gas per week.

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we can break down the problem into two parts: the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. To find the amount she spent, we can multiply the number of twenties by the fraction she spent:

(3/5) × 10 = (3 × 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Since each twenty is worth $20, the amount she spent on twenties is:

6 × $20 = $120

Next, let's calculate the amount she spent on quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the amount she spent on quarters is:

140 × $0.25 = $35

Now, we can find the total amount she paid for lunch by adding the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters:

$120 + $35 = $155

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the yield of each plant type and then summing the results.

Let's denote the number of tomato plants as T and the number of eggplant plants as E. We are given T = 5 and E = 8.

The yield of tomatoes per plant is 22, and the yield of eggplants per plant is 4. Therefore, the total yield of tomatoes is 22T and the total yield of eggplants is 4E.

The total number of fruits can be calculated as:

Total Fruits = 22T + 4E
= 22(5) + 4(8)
= 110 + 32
= 142

Therefore, Ricardo can expect a total of 142 fruits from his plants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can utilize the concept of complementary probabilities. Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs, we can calculate the proportion of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the sum of these proportions from 1.

Let's denote the total number of TVs sold as T. We can express the number of smart TVs as (1/4)T and the number of analog TVs as (1/8)T. The number of OLED TVs can be represented as T - [(1/4)T + (1/8)T].

Simplifying the expression, we get T - [(2/8)T + (1/8)T] = T - (3/8)T = (5/8)T.

Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can substitute T = 40 into the expression to find the number of OLED TVs sold:

(5/8) * 40 = 25

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, John is responsible for the remaining half. The total cost of the trip is $300, so John's share is $300 / 2 = $150.

Given that John has $50, we can calculate the amount he is missing by subtracting his available funds from his share of the trip cost: $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. Given that the temperature difference between day and night is 12 degrees, and each log heats the house by 5 degrees, we can calculate the required number of logs as follows:

Let's denote the number of logs as 'x'. The total temperature increase required to prevent the pipes from freezing is 12 degrees. Since each log contributes a 5-degree increase, we can set up the following equation:

5x = 12

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 12/5

x = 2.4

Since we cannot burn a fraction of a log, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we first need to calculate the number of groups and then multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that contributed as:

Number of contributing groups = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

As each group brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells collected is:

Total seashells = Number of contributing groups * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train after the sequence of events, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, resulting in 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138. Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, the number of people on the train is 100.

"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps collected per day (10) by the number of days in the month (30) to obtain the total number of bottle caps collected:

10 bottle caps/day × 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Next, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap ($0.25) to determine the total amount of money earned:

300 bottle caps × $0.25/bottle cap = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we can calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours and the additional hours separately and then sum them.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which can be calculated as:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Total earnings for the day:
$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. Given that there are 12 female lions and half as many male lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of the jeans.

Given that the original price of the jeans is $40 and the discount is 25%, we can calculate the amount of the discount as follows:

Discount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 × $40 = $10

The discounted price of the jeans can be calculated by subtracting the discount from the original price:

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
= $40 - $10
= $30

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

Amount Left Over = $50 - Discounted Price
= $50 - $30
= $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the discounted jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the company hires 20 new employees every month, we can model the total number of employees as a linear function of time.

Let's denote the initial number of employees as \(N_0 = 200\) and the monthly increase in employees as \(r = 20\). The total number of employees after \(t\) months can be represented as \(N(t) = N_0 + rt\).

In this case, we're interested in the total salary paid after 3 months. The salary per employee is $4000, so the total salary paid can be calculated as the product of the total number of employees and the salary per employee.

Total salary paid after 3 months = \(N(3) \times 4000\)

First, calculate the total number of employees after 3 months:
\(N(3) = N_0 + 3r = 200 + 3(20) = 200 + 60 = 260\)

Now, calculate the total salary paid after 3 months:
Total salary paid after 3 months = \(260 \times 4000 = \$1,040,000\)

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. Given that ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, we can calculate the total time by adding these two values.

Let's denote the time for ""Deck the Halls"" as D and the time for ""Jingle Bells"" as J. We are given D = 150 seconds and J = 240 seconds. The total time can be calculated as:

Total Time = D + J
Total Time = 150 + 240
Total Time = 390 seconds

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for 390 seconds.

Final answer: 390"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a $0.50 per hour raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following a subsequent $1.00 per hour raise, his wage increased to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the cost difference between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. The cost of 3 loaves of bread can be calculated as 3 times the cost of a single loaf, which is $2. This yields a total cost of 3 × $2 = $6. Similarly, the cost of 2 bagels is 2 times the cost of a single bagel, resulting in a total cost of 2 × $1 = $2.

The difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels can be found by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, the cost difference is $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate Nikita's score, which is 11 more than half of Pierson's score. We can express this as:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11

Given that Pierson scored 278 points, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of students and teachers. With 40 classes, each having an average of 25 students and 3 teachers, we can calculate the total number of students and teachers as follows:

Total students = 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students
Total teachers = 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each student plants one tree and each teacher plants two trees, the total number of trees planted can be calculated as:

Total trees = (Total students * 1 tree/student) + (Total teachers * 2 trees/teacher)
Total trees = (1000 * 1) + (120 * 2)
Total trees = 1000 + 240
Total trees = 1240

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats to her total collection, we can employ the concept of ratios and proportions.

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats as x. The total number of stuffed animals will be the sum of the existing animals (3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14) and the additional goats (x). We can set up the proportion:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7:

x = 4.2 / 0.7

x = 6

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats to her total collection.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the required 30 hours.

Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days, which equals 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours. Then, she plays for 2 hours per day for 7 days, resulting in an additional 7 * 2 = 14 hours. The total hours played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To find the remaining hours needed, we subtract the total hours played from the required hours: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the initial distance between the two cars as x miles. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will cover more ground in the same time frame.

The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour. 

Using the formula for relative motion, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours can be calculated as:

Distance = Initial Distance + (Relative Speed * Time)
= x + (10 * 2)
= x + 20

However, we need to consider the fact that the second car overtook the first car, so the initial distance between them is equal to the distance traveled by the first car. Therefore, the correct equation becomes:

Distance = 120 + (10 * 2)
= 120 + 20
= 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we must consider the cost of the diamond, the cost of the gold, and the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, totaling $900. The premium is 30% of the total cost.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total Cost = Cost of Diamond + Cost of Gold + Premium
Total Cost = $600 + $300 + (30% of $900)

To calculate the premium, we multiply the total cost by 0.3:

Premium = 0.3 * $900
Premium = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost:

Total Cost = $600 + $300 + $270
Total Cost = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's denote the number of third-graders who passed as T3, the number of fourth-graders who passed as T4, and the number of fifth-graders who passed as T5. We are given that T3 = 340, T4 = 40, and T5 = 2 * T4 = 80.

The total number of students who passed is the sum of the students who passed in each grade: T3 + T4 + T5 = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.

The total number of students in the school is the sum of the students in each grade: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000.

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate using the formula: (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100.

Overall pass rate = (460 / 1000) * 100 = 46%

Therefore, the overall pass rate is 46%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we must first calculate the total area that can be covered by the available glass chips. Given that each square inch requires 12 chips and there are 72 chips in a bag, we can calculate the total area as follows:

Total chips = 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips
Area = Total chips / chips per square inch = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Since the desired height of the mosaic is 3 inches, we can calculate the length by dividing the area by the height:

Length = Area / Height = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can create a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed by the students. 

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total amount consumed by this group is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 

Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount consumed by this group is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is the sum of the amounts consumed by both groups: 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts). 

48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Dale had 100 candies and sold 150, resulting in a net loss of 50 candies. However, this is an unrealistic scenario, as it implies a negative quantity. A more plausible interpretation is that Dale initially had 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, bringing his total to 200 candies. 

Given that he has 200 candies and has already sold 150, we can calculate the number of candies he still needs to sell by subtracting the number sold from the total: 200 - 150 = 50.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

Final Answer: The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we can model the growth of the student population using exponential growth. Given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can express this as a geometric sequence.

Let's denote the initial number of students as P0 = 10. The common ratio (r) for the geometric sequence is 2, since the number of students doubles each month. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

An = P0 * r^(n-1)

We want to find the number of students at the end of May, which corresponds to the 5th term (n = 5). Plugging in the values, we get:

A5 = 10 * 2^(5-1)
A5 = 10 * 2^4
A5 = 10 * 16
A5 = 160

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from the total number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = A5 - P0
= 160 - 10
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that Felix's earnings are directly proportional to the number of branches he climbs, we can establish a ratio between the total earnings and the cost per branch.

Let's denote the total number of branches climbed as 'x'. The total earnings can be represented as 0.25x, where 0.25 is the cost per branch. We are given that Felix's total earnings for the week amount to $105. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.25x = 105

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:

x = 105 / 0.25
x = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches per day = x / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ a systematic approach to account for the varying numbers of flowers and their respective petal counts.

Let's calculate the total number of petals by multiplying the number of flowers by their respective petal counts and then summing the results:

Total petals = (3 * 5) + (4 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (6 * 7)
Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
Total petals = 101

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we must subtract the total number of petals she dropped from the total number of petals picked:

Total petals remaining = Total petals - (1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 7)
Total petals remaining = 101 - (5 + 6 + 4 + 7)
Total petals remaining = 101 - 22
Total petals remaining = 79

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 79.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to consider the total number of marshmallows available and the number of S'mores already made.

Let's denote the total number of marshmallows as M, the number of S'mores made by John as J, and the number of S'mores made by DeSean as D. We are given that M = 35, J = 9, and D = 9.

First, we calculate the total number of S'mores made by both John and DeSean: J + D = 9 + 9 = 18.

Next, we subtract the number of marshmallows dropped from the total number of marshmallows to find the remaining marshmallows: M - 3 = 35 - 3 = 32.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores that can be made with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of remaining marshmallows: 32.

To find the number of S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores that can be made by 2: 32 / 2 = 16.

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 16"
"To determine the total amount of money used, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time each individual played and multiplying it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as t_J, the time his friend plays as t_F1, and the time the better friend plays as t_F2. We are given that t_J = 240 minutes, t_F1 = 120 minutes, and t_F2 = 1.5t_J = 360 minutes.

The cost per game is 20 minutes per quarter, so the cost per minute is 1/20 dollars. We can now calculate the cost for each individual:

Cost for Jack = t_J * (1/20) = 240 * (1/20) = 12 quarters
Cost for Friend 1 = t_F1 * (1/20) = 120 * (1/20) = 6 quarters
Cost for Friend 2 = t_F2 * (1/20) = 360 * (1/20) = 18 quarters

The total number of quarters used is the sum of the quarters used by each individual: 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 36 * $0.25 = $9.

The final answer is: $9"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil as S, Z, F, and O, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. S = Z (the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance)
2. S = 2Z (the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest)
3. O = 2S (the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt)
4. The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so S + Z + F + O = 10.

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. From equation (1), we know F = Z. Substituting F = Z into equation (3), we get O = 2S. Substituting S = 2Z into equation (3), we get O = 2(2Z) = 4Z.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for S and O into the total mixture equation:

2Z + Z + Z + 4Z = 10

Combine like terms:

8Z = 10

Divide both sides by 8:

Z = 10/8 = 5/4

Now that we know Z, we can find S and O:

S = 2Z = 2(5/4) = 5/2

O = 4Z = 4(5/4) = 5

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 5 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats: 3 goats × $500 per goat = $1500.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows: 2 cows × $1500 per cow = $3000.

Finally, we add the costs of the goats and cows to obtain the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of additional cupcakes Paul needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Given that Paul requires 63 cupcakes in total and already possesses 48 cupcakes (8 chocolate and 40 toffee), we can calculate the number of additional cupcakes needed as follows:

Number of cupcakes needed = Total cupcakes required - Cupcakes already available
= 63 - 48
= 15

Therefore, Paul needs to acquire 15 more cupcakes to meet the total demand for the birthday party.

Final Answer: The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe's initial number of cars can be calculated as 2 * 20 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells. 20% of his cars are sold, which can be expressed as 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, we calculate the number of cars Joe gives away to his mother. Since he gives away twice as many cars as he sold, the number of cars given away is 2 * 8 = 16.

Finally, we subtract the number of cars given away from the number of cars Joe has after selling to find the number of cars he remains with: 32 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can employ a straightforward division approach. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 contributed by organizations, the remaining amount must have been generated by the students. This can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by students by the number of students (20):

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students ÷ Number of students
= $125,000 ÷ 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we can employ the concept of linear addition. Given that she walked for 8 hours on the first day and half as many hours on the second day, we can express this as:

Time walked on the first day = 8 hours
Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = Time walked on the first day + Time walked on the second day
= 8 + 4
= 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we can utilize the conversion factor: 1 hour = 60 minutes

Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour
= 12 * 60
= 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

Initially, the parking lot had 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars. 

When Hunter exited the classroom for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had departed, which equates to 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars. 

To find the number of cars remaining, we subtract the number of cars that departed from the total: 70 - 35 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

35"
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we can employ the concept of total work hours and task-based compensation. Given that John completes 30 cycles of work per day, with each cycle consisting of 5 tasks, we can first determine the total number of tasks completed in a week.

Let's denote the number of tasks per cycle as 't' and the number of cycles per day as 'c'. The total number of tasks per day can be expressed as t * c, and the total number of tasks in a week as (t * c) * 7.

Given:
t = 5 (tasks per cycle)
c = 30 (cycles per day)

Total tasks per day = t * c = 5 * 30 = 150
Total tasks in a week = (t * c) * 7 = 150 * 7 = 1050

The payment per task is $1.20. To find the total weekly earnings, we multiply the total number of tasks in a week by the payment per task.

Total weekly earnings = Total tasks in a week * Payment per task
= 1050 * $1.20
= $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine Sasha's total points scored during both games, we can analyze the information provided.

Given that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, we can calculate Julie's score as 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Therefore, Sasha's score in the second game can be calculated as 10 - 6 = 4 points.

To find the total points scored by Sasha during both games, we can add the points from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of tins of cat food by multiplying the number of packages (8) by the number of tins per package (11): 8 × 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food by multiplying the number of packages (6) by the number of tins per package (6): 6 × 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each individual has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x, Smendrick has as 3x, and Becca has as 3x + 12.

We are given that the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we obtain:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have determined PJ has 47 cards, we can calculate the number of cards Becca has:

Becca's cards = 3x + 12
= 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P/3

We can substitute the values of B and P in terms of G into the equation for Y:

Y = (B - 1)/3
Y = ((2G - 1)/3)

Now, we can express the total number of eggs (T) as the sum of the individual types:

T = G + B + P + Y
T = G + 2G + (2G - 1) + (2G - 1)/3

Combine like terms and simplify:

T = 7G - 2/3

Substitute the given value of G:

T = 7(5) - 2/3
T = 35 - 2/3
T = 33 2/3

Therefore, Cindy had 33 2/3 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33 \frac{2}{3}}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping can be calculated using the formula: Cost = (Weight * Rate per pound) + (Distance * Rate per mile)
Cost = (4 pounds * $0.35 per pound) + (20 miles * $0.08 per mile)
Cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Cost = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price - Refund amount - Shipping cost
Amount Milly will lose = $32 - $24 - $3
Amount Milly will lose = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Mulan initially possesses, which is the sum of the amount she had and the amount her father gave her: $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, which includes two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. This can be expressed as 2 * $30 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount to find the amount of money Mulan has left: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can utilize the information provided to calculate the weekly production pattern. 

Given that Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week, then half as much in the second week, and three times as much in the third week, we can establish a pattern. 

Let's denote the production for the first week as x. Then, the production for the second week is x/2, and the production for the third week is 3x. 

We know that the total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + (x/2) + 3x. Since the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, we can set up the equation:

8,000 + (x/2) + 3x = 50,000

To solve for x, we can first combine like terms:

8,000 + (5x/2) = 50,000

Subtracting 8,000 from both sides:

(5x/2) = 42,000

Multiplying both sides by 2:

5x = 84,000

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 16,800

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the production for the fourth week:

Production for the fourth week = x/2 = 16,800 / 2 = 8,400

The final answer is: 8,400"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours. This can be expressed as 8 hours/week * 4 weeks = 32 hours.

Next, we calculate the time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week. Therefore, the total time spent on makeup is 1.5 hours/week * 4 weeks = 6 hours.

Now, we add the time spent on both activities: 32 hours + 6 hours = 38 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total cost for Angela's interior design installation, we must first calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items separately.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the number of additional items, we subtract the standard quantities from the quantities Angela has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela's interior design installation is the sum of the cost of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine Roy's savings, we can employ a step-by-step approach, leveraging the given information to calculate his total savings.

First, we establish the known quantities:

1. Eva's savings: $20
2. Anthony's savings: $20 + $10 = $30
3. Roy's savings: 40% more than Anthony's savings

To calculate 40% of Anthony's savings, we can use the formula: (40/100) * Anthony's savings

Let's denote Anthony's savings as A. Then, 40% of A is (40/100) * A = 0.4A.

Now, we can express Roy's savings as the sum of Anthony's savings and 40% of Anthony's savings: Roy's savings = A + 0.4A = 1.4A

Given that Anthony's savings (A) is $30, we can substitute this value into the equation: Roy's savings = 1.4 * $30

Now, we can calculate Roy's savings: Roy's savings = 1.4 * $30 = $42

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach.

Let's denote the height of the mountain Pompei can lift as P, the height Saskay can lift as S, the height Kagiyami can lift as K, and the height Naruto can lift as N. We are given the following relationships:

1. P = 1 inch
2. S = 12P
3. K = 4S
4. N = 10K

Substituting the expressions for S and K into the equation for N, we get:

N = 10(4S)
N = 40S
N = 40(12P)
N = 480P

Since P = 1 inch, we can substitute this value into the equation for N:

N = 480(1)
N = 480 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

N = 480/12
N = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total distance traveled by Mason, we can apply the fundamental principles of kinematics, specifically the concept of distance-time-speed relationships. Given that Mason's speed is constant at 8 miles per hour, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the total time elapsed.

Let's break down the problem into two segments: the initial 4 hours and the subsequent 6 hours. The distance traveled during each segment can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time

For the first 4 hours:
Distance1 = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

For the next 6 hours:
Distance2 = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled during each segment:
Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total Distance = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total distance of 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative motion and the inverse relationship between speed, distance, and time. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'v' and the speed of a turtle as 'v/2'. We are given that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, so we can set up the equation:

3v * 18 = d

where 'd' is the distance across the highway.

We are asked to find the time it takes for 4 turtles to cover the same distance. Since the distance remains constant, we can set up a proportion using the speeds and times:

(3v * 18) / (4 * (v/2)) = t

where 't' is the time taken by the turtles. Simplifying the equation, we get:

(3v * 18) / (2v) = t
27 = t

Therefore, it will take the 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

27"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as 'x'. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes Rory made can be expressed as x + 20. Jada, on the other hand, made twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes Jada made can be represented as 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes, we get:

Rory's dishes: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

Now, let's calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total = 20 + 40 + 80
Total = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x.

The total cost of the laptop after trading in her old one is $400. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. The amount she still needs to buy the laptop is $50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of slices and then subtracting the number of slices Adam consumed.

Let's denote the number of large apples as L and the number of small apples as S. We are given that L = 3 and S = 5. The number of slices from large apples is 5L, and the number of slices from small apples is 3S.

Total number of slices = 5L + 3S
= 5(3) + 3(5)
= 15 + 15
= 30

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 - 15
= 15

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"To determine the number of additional cows required to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we can employ a simple linear extrapolation approach. Given that the farmer currently has 3 cows producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can establish a baseline milk production rate of 15 liters per day (3 cows * 5 liters/cow).

To achieve a target milk production of 25 liters per day, we can calculate the required increase in milk production as follows:

Increase in milk production = Target milk production - Baseline milk production
= 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day
= 10 liters/day

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, we can calculate the required number of additional cows as follows:

Number of additional cows = Increase in milk production / Milk production per cow
= 10 liters/day / 5 liters/cow
= 2 cows

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 additional cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

Let's analyze each glue stick individually:

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we can calculate the fraction of the original length that is used: 
(5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we can calculate the fraction of the original length that is used: 
(1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we can calculate the fraction of the original length that is used: 
(1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together: 
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has: $5,000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Final answer: $5600"
"To determine the change Thea received, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The total amount she provided is the product of the number of $20 bills and the denomination of each bill, which is 4 * $20 = $80. 

The change can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the hat ($70) from the total amount provided ($80):

$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change.

The final answer is: $10"
"To determine Craig's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent on the squirt guns and water balloons. 

Craig initially possesses $40, which can be expressed as 2 × $20. The cost of the squirt guns is 6 × $2, resulting in a total expenditure of $12. The cost of the water balloons is 3 × $3, yielding a total expenditure of $9. 

The total amount spent is the sum of these expenditures: $12 + $9 = $21. To find Craig's remaining funds, we subtract the total amount spent from his initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes each individual has.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes Jack has as D. We are given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this relationship as:

D = 2S

We are also given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

60 = 2S

Solving for S, we find:

S = 60 / 2
S = 30

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can express the number of socks Peter has as:

P = 2S
P = 2(30)
P = 60

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together:

Total Socks = S + P
Total Socks = 30 + 60
Total Socks = 90

We are also given that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so we can express the number of dishes Peter has as:

P = D/2

Since Jack has 60 dishes, we can substitute this value into the equation:

P = 60/2
P = 30

Now, we can find the total number of dishes they have together:

Total Dishes = D + P
Total Dishes = 60 + 30
Total Dishes = 90

Finally, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total = Total Socks + Total Dishes
Total = 90 + 90
Total = 180

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can employ the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as N, the number of students good at math as M, the number of students good at English as E, and the number of students good at both as B.

Given:
N = 20
M (math only) = 5
E (English only) = 8

We are tasked with finding M (total good at math), which can be calculated using the formula:

M = M (math only) + B (both)

First, we need to find the number of students good at both math and English (B). We can do this by subtracting the number of students good at English only and the number of students good at math only from the total number of students:

B = N - (M (math only) + E (English only))
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, we can find the total number of students good at math by adding the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M = M (math only) + B
= 5 + 7
= 12

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total available time and the time required for each group's performance, including setup and teardown.

The total available time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, 6 minutes for performance, and 2 minutes for teardown, resulting in a total time of 18 minutes per group.

To find the maximum number of groups that can perform, we can divide the total available time by the time required per group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time per group
= 120 minutes / 18 minutes
= 6.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure that all groups have sufficient time to perform without exceeding the total available time. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 6.

Final answer: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount after t years
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75 as a decimal)
t = time in years (3)

First, we calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we add the interest to the principal amount for each year:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = P + Interest = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = P + Interest = $750 + $225 = $975

Therefore, Brenda will have a total of $975 after 3 years.

The final answer is $975."
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we can employ a systematic approach. 

First, we need to identify the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that the tray capacity is 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we can calculate the number of trays as follows:

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of goats in Farm X as x and the initial number of goats in Farm Y as y. We are given that x = 55 and y = 45.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is x - 10. He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is y - 20.

The total number of goats left in both farms can be calculated as (x - 10) + (y - 20).

Substituting the given values, we get:
(x - 10) + (y - 20) = (55 - 10) + (45 - 20)
= 45 + 25
= 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that James purchases 2 pairs of shoes per month and spends $2640 on shoes annually, we can calculate the average cost per pair as follows:

Average cost per pair = Total annual expenditure on shoes / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

Therefore, James pays an average of $1320 for each pair of shoes.

The final answer is: $1320"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with a $2 discount on each basket of red food, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the green food: 3 baskets * $25 per basket = $75.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the red food, taking into account the $2 discount per basket. The discounted price per basket of red food is $18 - $2 = $16. Therefore, the total cost of 3 baskets of red food is 3 * $16 = $48.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.

The total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with a $2 discount on each basket of red food is $123."
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that there are 90 rooms in total and we are interested in cleaning half of them, we can calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned as follows:

Number of rooms to be cleaned = Total number of rooms / 2
= 90 / 2
= 45 rooms

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean 45 rooms can be calculated as:

Time = Number of rooms * Time per room
= 45 * 20 minutes
= 900 minutes

To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time (in hours) = 900 minutes / 60
= 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

In the first year, the town will construct 12 homes. In the subsequent year, they will build three times this amount, resulting in 3 * 12 = 36 homes. In the third year, they will double the cumulative total from the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three-year period by summing the individual year's contributions: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the ages of the brother, sister, and myself as x, y, and z, respectively.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. x = z + 3 (I am three years younger than my brother)

"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. Given that the amount of water doubles on the second day, we can model this as an exponential function.

Let's denote the initial amount of water as P0 = 4000 gallons. On the second day, the amount of water becomes 2P0, and on the third day, it increases by 6000 gallons. This can be represented as:

P3 = 2P2 + 6000

Since P2 is twice the initial amount, we can rewrite the equation as:

P3 = 2(2P0) + 6000
P3 = 4P0 + 6000

Substituting P0 = 4000, we get:

P3 = 4(4000) + 6000
P3 = 16000 + 6000
P3 = 22000

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"This problem can be modeled using the concept of exponential growth, where the number of infected individuals grows by a fixed factor each day. In this case, the initial number of infected individuals is 10, and each infected individual infects 6 others, resulting in a growth factor of 6.

The number of infected individuals on day n can be represented by the formula:

N(n) = N0 * (1 + r)^n

where N0 is the initial number of infected individuals (10 in this case), r is the growth factor (6 in this case), and n is the number of days.

To find the total number of infected individuals after 3 days, we can plug in n = 3 into the formula:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
= 10 * (7)^3
= 10 * 343
= 3430

Therefore, the total number of infected individuals after 3 days is 3430.

"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Given that Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, we can calculate her total tips as 40 * $20 = $800.

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can express this as 0.9 times Rafaela's total tips. Therefore, Julieta's total tips can be calculated as 0.9 * $800 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is the sum of their individual tips, which is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach.

"To determine the number of badges earned by each individual, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of badges earned by Claire, Amber, and Wendy as C, A, and W, respectively. We are given that Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year (12 months), she earns 12 badges. This can be expressed as:

C = 12

We are also given that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, which implies that Amber earns half the number of badges Claire earns in the same time frame. Therefore, we can express Amber's badge earnings as:

A = C/2
A = 12/2
A = 6

Additionally, Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so we can express Wendy's badge earnings as:

W = 3C
W = 3(12)
W = 36

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

W - A = 36 - 6
W - A = 30

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Paige baked 10 loaves of banana bread, with each loaf yielding 8 slices. The total number of slices is then 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Given that each slice is sold for $0.50, the total amount raised can be calculated as 80 * $0.50 = $40.

"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We are informed that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Solving for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins (x = 40), we can calculate the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"

"To determine the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 12
2. G = R - 2
3. B = 3G
4. R + G + B + Y = 75

Substituting the first two equations into the fourth equation, we get:

12 + (12 - 2) + 3(12 - 2) + Y = 75

Simplifying the equation:

12 + 10 + 3(10) + Y = 75
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75

Subtracting 52 from both sides:

Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x, Anne has as y, and Sofie has as z.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as:

z = y + 25

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as:

y = x - 12

Lastly, we know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 85

Substituting the expressions for z and y in terms of x into the total equation, we get:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 13 = 85

Subtract 13 from both sides:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Therefore, Fawn has 24 books.

"To determine the weight of the carrots, we can utilize a step-by-step approach. 

First, we establish the weight of the sweet potatoes, which is 2 times the weight of the potatoes. Given that the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

Next, we calculate the weight of the carrots by subtracting 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes. This results in 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the carrots is 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that a three-ounce box of flavored jello yields 10 small jello cups, we can calculate the number of boxes required to meet the demand.

Let's denote the number of boxes needed as 'x'. Since each box contains 10 cups, the total number of cups required can be expressed as 10x. We are told that there will be 30 kids, and each kid will receive 4 jello cups. Therefore, the total number of cups needed is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.

Equating the total cups required to the number of cups per box multiplied by the number of boxes, we get the equation:

10x = 120

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 120 / 10
x = 12

Now that we know the number of boxes required, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes by the price per box:

Total cost = Number of boxes * Price per box
Total cost = 12 * $1.25
Total cost = $15

The final answer is: $15"

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we can employ the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, with Madeline paying 60% of the total monthly expenditure, we can calculate Keenan's share as follows:

Let's denote the total monthly expenditure as $400. Since Madeline pays 60% of this amount, her share is 0.6 × $400 = $240. Consequently, Keenan's share, which is the remaining 40% of the total expenditure, can be calculated as:

Keenan's share = Total expenditure - Madeline's share
= $400 - $240
= $160

To find Keenan's weekly expenditure, we can divide his monthly share by the number of weeks in a month (4):

Keenan's weekly expenditure = $160 ÷ 4
= $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he consumed 2/5 of the total 60 pieces, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

(2/5) × 60 = 24

Next, we subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total to find the remaining pieces:

60 - 24 = 36

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces, leaving him with:

36 - 10 = 26

Now, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. He consumed 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces, which can be expressed as:

(7/13) × 26 = 14.3076923077 (round down to 14 since we can't eat a fraction of a piece)

To find the total number of pieces eaten, we add the pieces consumed on each day:

24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can apply the principles of linear algebra and basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the cost of one bottle of soda as S and the cost of one bottle of water as W. We are given that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, so we can write the equation 7S = 21. Solving for S, we get S = 21/7 = $3.00.

Similarly, we are given that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, so we can write the equation 4W = 8. Solving for W, we get W = 8/4 = $2.00.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water by multiplying the respective costs and adding them together: 3S + 2W = 3($3.00) + 2($2.00) = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final answer is: $13.00"
"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the bolts by multiplying the cost per bolt by the number of bolts: 

Cost per bolt = $0.03
Number of bolts = 16
Total cost = Cost per bolt * Number of bolts
Total cost = $0.03 * 16
Total cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:
Initial amount = $12.48
Amount left = Initial amount - Total cost
Amount left = $12.48 - $0.48
Amount left = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking, we can employ the concept of hourly wage. Given that she earned $33 for 3 hours of work, we can calculate her hourly wage as follows:

Hourly wage = Total earnings / Total hours worked
Hourly wage = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly wage = $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate her total earnings after 12 hours of work by multiplying her hourly wage by the total hours worked:

Total earnings = Hourly wage * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

Therefore, Ella's total earnings after 12 hours of dog walking would be $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Paul possesses 52 marbles. His friend presents him with an additional 28 marbles, resulting in a total of 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

However, Paul subsequently experiences a loss of 1/4 of his marbles. To calculate this, we can express 1/4 as a decimal, which is 0.25. Multiplying 80 by 0.25 yields 20, indicating that Paul loses 20 marbles.

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total, we obtain 80 - 20 = 60. Therefore, Paul now possesses 60 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine Amy's total score, we can calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since there are 10 questions, and each question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions can be calculated as:

10 questions * 1 point per question = 10 points

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions, and each question is worth 1 point. Therefore, the total points from true/false questions can be calculated as:

20 questions * 1 point per question = 20 points

Lastly, we'll calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions, and each question is worth 5 points. Therefore, the total points from long-answer questions can be calculated as:

5 questions * 5 points per question = 25 points

Now, we can add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

10 points (multiple-choice) + 20 points (true/false) + 25 points (long-answer) = 55 points

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we can use the concept of profit and loss. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens at $50 each. Let's denote the cost price of each chicken as x.

The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is 180 * 50 = $9000. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost price of the chickens should be:

Cost price = Total revenue - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Since Isaias is selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, the total number of chickens sold is 3/5 * 300 = 180. The cost price of each chicken can be found by dividing the total cost price by the number of chickens sold:

Cost price per chicken = Total cost price / Number of chickens sold
= $7000 / 180
= $38.89 (approximately)

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the number of glasses Julie sold more than Micah, we can utilize the concept of equal distribution of glasses among the three individuals. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, and the total number of glasses sold is 32, we can calculate the number of glasses sold by each individual.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as x. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Mitchell also sold x glasses. The total number of glasses sold can be represented as:

x + x + 14 = 32

Combine like terms:

2x + 14 = 32

Subtract 14 from both sides:

2x = 18

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Micah sold 9 glasses, we can calculate the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah:

14 (Julie) - 9 (Micah) = 5

H = $400
M = 1/4 * H
P = 3/4 * M

We can express M and P in terms of H:
M = 1/4 * $400 = $100
P = 3/4 * $100 = $75

Now, we can calculate the total expenditure by adding the costs of all services:
Total Expenditure = H + M + P
= $400 + $100 + $75
= $575

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa."
"To determine the amount of money Sarah will have left over after purchasing the new rope, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope. Given that the rope is 20 meters long and costs $1.5 per meter, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = Length of Rope * Cost per Meter
Total Cost = 20 meters * $1.5/meter
Total Cost = $30

Next, we need to calculate the amount of money Sarah has. Since the rope she has is also 20 meters long and costs $2 per meter, the total amount she has is:

Total Amount = Length of Rope * Cost per Meter
Total Amount = 20 meters * $2/meter
Total Amount = $40

Now, we can find the amount of money Sarah will have left over by subtracting the total cost of the new rope from the total amount she has:

Amount Left Over = Total Amount - Total Cost
Amount Left Over = $40 - $30
Amount Left Over = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after purchasing the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining Melanie's current age as 'x'. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. This can be represented as:

3x = ?

Substituting the value of x, we get:

3(8) = 24

Since we want to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 24

where y is the number of years. We already know that x = 8, so:

8 + y = 24

Solving for y, we get:

y = 24 - 8
y = 16

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of each item.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the runtime of the final concert as 2x. Additionally, we know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert can be represented as 2x + 15.

Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

= 75

Now, we calculate the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants:

Number of outdoor plants = (2/3) * 75
= 50

Finally, we determine the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

Number of flowering plants = 75 - 50
= 25

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100
= 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and the thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x. We are also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Setting up the equation 11x = 121, we can solve for x to find the speed of the thingamabob: 

x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we have determined the speed of the thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. 

Speed of whirligig = 5x 
= 5 * 11 
= 55 meters per second 

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can start by calculating the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Mark's new weekly earnings, we can apply the concept of hourly wage multiplication. Given that Mark's hourly wage has increased by $2, we can calculate his new hourly wage as follows:

New hourly wage = Original hourly wage + Raise
New hourly wage = $10 + $2
New hourly wage = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours worked in a week:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $480

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we must first establish the relationship between the number of lawns mowed and the earnings. Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Consequently, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times.

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for his lawn, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as 6x. We are informed that the total earnings from mowing lawns amount to $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

Solving for x, we obtain:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we cannot mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information. Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as X, and Harry's weight as H.

Given:
1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. X = C + 8
4. H = X - 5

Substituting the values from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3), we get:
X = (M + 16) + 8
X = 55 + 16 + 8
X = 79 kg

Now, substituting the value of X into equation (4), we can find Harry's weight:
H = X - 5
H = 79 - 5
H = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To calculate John's profit, we can employ the concept of hourly wage and total hours worked. Given that John rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and earns $25 per hour, we can determine his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Hourly wage * Total hours worked
Total earnings = $25/hour * 30 hours
Total earnings = $750

Next, we subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit from renting his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph initially had as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's initial number of notebooks as 3x.

Given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, her total number of notebooks is now 3x + 5. We are also told that this total is equal to 7. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph initially had 2/3 notebooks, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - (2/3)
= 7 - 2/3
= (21/3) - (2/3)
= 19/3

Therefore, Martha has 19/3 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{19}{3}}$"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote Dijana's distance as x. Then, Anis' distance can be represented as x + (1/5)x, which simplifies to (6/5)x.

We are given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis' distance by substituting the value of x into the expression (6/5)x:
Anis' distance = (6/5) * 50
Anis' distance = 60

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we can add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the reduction in the total number of cookies due to the husband's actions. This can be achieved by subtracting the number of cookies taken from the initial total.

Let's denote the initial total number of cookies as C and the number of cookies taken by the husband as H. The remaining cookies can be calculated as:

C - H = 100 - 4 = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews (N) to determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive:

Cookies per nephew = (C - H) / N
= 96 / 6
= 16

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can analyze their reading patterns.

Let's denote the number of pages read by Denise yesterday as D1 and the number of pages read by Daniel yesterday as D2. We are given that D1 = 10 and D2 = 13.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can represent the number of pages read by Denise today as D3 = D1 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

The total number of pages read by Denise is the sum of the pages read yesterday and today, which is D1 + D3 = 10 + 15 = 25. Similarly, the total number of pages read by Daniel is D2 = 13.

To find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise: 25 - 13 = 12.

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we must first establish the total amount of soup available. Given that the pot can fill four adult-sized bowls or eight child-sized bowls, we can deduce that the total capacity is a multiple of 8, as it can accommodate both adult and child portions.

Let's denote the total capacity as 8x, where x is a positive integer. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, the total number of adult portions is 3 (Calvin, his wife, and himself). Therefore, the number of child portions is 8x - 3.

Now, we need to subtract the number of bowls eaten for dinner, which is 4. This leaves us with 8x - 3 - 4 = 8x - 7 bowls of soup available for lunch.

Since there are two children, we can divide the remaining soup by 2 to determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch: (8x - 7) / 2.

However, without knowing the value of x, we cannot provide a numerical answer. Nevertheless, we can express the solution as a function of x: (8x - 7) / 2.

Since we cannot provide a numerical answer without knowing the value of x, we will leave the solution in this form.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{8x - 7}{2}}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we can apply the principles of arithmetic. The cost of five notebooks can be calculated as 5 × $1.50, and the cost of one ballpen is $0.50. 

The total cost is the sum of these two values: $5.00 + $0.50.

Total cost = $5.50"
"To determine the total material required, we can calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then sum the results.

For small masks, we have 20 masks, and each set requires 2 yards of material. Therefore, the total material needed for small masks is:

20 masks / 4 masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
5 sets × 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks, we have 8 masks, and each set requires 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the total material needed for large masks is:

8 masks / 3 masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards
8/3 × 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards

The total material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks:

10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can employ the concept of total expenditure and the total number of tickets purchased. Given that Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies in the theater three times, the total number of tickets purchased is 9 * 3 = 27.

The total amount spent on these tickets is $216. To find the average price per ticket, we can divide the total expenditure by the total number of tickets:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the total number of hours in a day, which is 24. 

Next, we calculate the total hours Harold spends on activities other than sleep. He sleeps for 10 hours, works 8 hours (2 hours less than he sleeps), and walks his dog for 1 hour. 

The total hours spent on these activities can be calculated as follows: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours.

Now, we subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of blue and red shoe boxes left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of blue shoe boxes remaining by subtracting the number used from the initial total:
7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, we calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes to determine the number used:
(1/3) * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

Now, we subtract the number of red shoe boxes used from the initial total to find the number remaining:
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

Final Answer: The number of blue shoe boxes left is 4, and the number of red shoe boxes left is 6."
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sarah has as 's' and the number of books Joseph has as 'j'. We are given that Sarah has 9 books, so s = 9.

We are also given that Joseph has twice the number of books Sarah has, but he lost 2 of them. This can be expressed as j = 2s - 2.

Substituting the value of s into the equation, we get j = 2(9) - 2.

j = 18 - 2

j = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the fraction of marbles Dean gave to Jamie: 1/5 of 30. This can be computed as follows:

(1/5) × 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles given to Donald:

6 (marbles given to Jamie) + 10 (marbles given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to model the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. The given information can be translated into the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

We can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Now that we have determined Adam's current age, we can calculate his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = x + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. This can be expressed as:

Let x be the number of acres of Farmer Brown's farm.
Farmer Smith's farm = 2x + 100
Since we know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can set up the equation:
x = 200
Farmer Smith's farm = 2(200) + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres of the two farms by adding them together:
Total acres = 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm)
Total acres = 700

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"In the context of Colby's work in the packaging division, we can model his earnings as a function of the number of packages completed per hour and the hourly wage. Given that he completes 10 fewer packages than the ideal 50 per hour, we can express this as 40 packages per hour.

To calculate his total earnings in an 8-hour workday, we can utilize the formula for total earnings, which is the product of the hourly wage and the total number of hours worked. In this case, the hourly wage is $0.20 per package, and the total number of hours worked is 8.

Total Earnings = Hourly Wage * Total Hours Worked
Total Earnings = $0.20 * 8
Total Earnings = $1.60

Therefore, Colby earns $1.60 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $1.60"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks during the time spent on sudoku, we must first calculate the total time spent on both puzzles. 

The time for a normal sudoku is 45 minutes, and the time for an extreme sudoku is 4 times that, which equals 180 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes. 

Number of bottles = Total time / 30
= 225 minutes / 30
= 7.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bottle, we can round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We are given that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, and there are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we have:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day and the car necessitates a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the total number of miles driven in 30 days as follows:

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Now, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval at which the tune-ups are required to find the number of tune-ups needed:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 miles/tune-up
= 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up
= 3

Therefore, Jon requires 3 tune-ups for his car during the 30-day period.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total hours worked by Bruce over the three days, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the hours worked on each day: 
Tuesday: 5 hours
Wednesday: 2 * 5 = 10 hours
Thursday: 10 - 2 = 8 hours

Then, we sum the hours worked each day to find the total hours worked:
Total hours = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we can approach the problem by first calculating the total amount spent on the cake and balloons, and then subtracting this from the total amount spent.

The cost of the cake is $11, and the cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since 1 dozen is 12, the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6. Therefore, the total amount spent on the cake and balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14. The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2

x = 15.5

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of fruits Kira initially purchased: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Next, we subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each activity and then sum them up.

First, we note that there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, which yields 12 students. 

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is 16 boys and 22 girls, resulting in a total of 38 students.

The total number of students is the sum of these three groups: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised from the sale of lollipops, we can employ the concept of linear algebra and basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of students as 'n', the number of lollipops sold per student as 'p', the cost price per lollipop as 'c', and the selling price per lollipop as 's'. We are given the following values: n = 30, p = 10, c = $0.5, and s = $0.8.

The total number of lollipops sold can be calculated as np, which equals 30 * 10 = 300 lollipops.

The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is s - c = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.

The total profit can be calculated by multiplying the total number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop: np * (s - c) = 300 * $0.3 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can employ a systematic approach by breaking down the information provided and applying mathematical operations to derive the solution.

First, we establish the number of each type of pet:

1. Cats: 3
2. Dogs: 3 times the number of cats, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs
3. Rabbits: 2 fewer than dogs, so 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits
4. Fish: 3 times the number of rabbits, so 3 * 7 = 21 fish
5. Gerbils: 1/3 the number of fish, so 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils

Now, we can calculate the total number of pets by summing the quantities of each type of pet:

Total number of pets = 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils)
Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7
Total number of pets = 47

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47.

The final answer is: $\boxed{47}$"
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we can employ a simple division-based approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Abby eats per day as A and the number of slices Josh eats per day as J. We are given that J = 2A. The total number of slices eaten per day is A + J, and the total number of slices in the loaf is 24. 

We can express this as an equation: A + J = 24. Substituting J = 2A into the equation, we get A + 2A = 24, which simplifies to 3A = 24.

Solving for A, we find A = 24 / 3 = 8. 

Now that we know Abby eats 8 slices per day, we can calculate the total number of days the loaf will last by dividing the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices eaten per day (8):

24 slices / 8 slices per day = 3 days.

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last 3 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression (AP). Since Martha collects one shell per month, the sequence of the number of shells collected forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

In this case, a1 = 1 (since Martha starts collecting shells at 5 years old) and d = 1 (since she collects one shell per month). We want to find the 60th term (since she has been collecting shells for 5 years, which is equivalent to 60 months).

Plugging in the values, we get:

a60 = 1 + (60 - 1)1
a60 = 1 + 59
a60 = 60

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Lana has a total of 27 cups and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are allocated for mint tea. 

Let's denote the number of cups of mint tea in each row as 'x'. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of cups of mint tea can be represented as 3x. We are also given that the total number of cups of mint tea is 12. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3x = 12

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 12 ÷ 3
x = 4

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we can employ a straightforward optimization approach. Given that the sloth's round-trip time is 4 hours, we can calculate the maximum number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

Let's denote the number of berries collected per trip as x. Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 24

To find the minimum value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24/2
x = 12

Therefore, the sloth can collect a minimum of 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate the initial volume of water in the tank, which is half the volume of the pool. Given that the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water, the initial volume in the tank is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 gallons.

Next, we need to account for the rate at which the tank is being emptied. The tank is being emptied at a constant rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water remaining after 6 days, we can subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial volume.

The total amount of water emptied in 6 days is 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3,000 gallons.

Now, we subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial volume to find the remaining amount: 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"Given Colby's monthly allowance of $150, we can calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses of popcorn and candy. The total cost of these items is $8 + $8 = $16. Subtracting this from his allowance yields $150 - $16 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, Colby will spend $10 on a movie ticket. Therefore, his remaining budget is $134 - $10 = $124.

To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we can divide his remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket: $124 ÷ $10 = 12.4.

However, since Colby cannot purchase a fraction of a movie ticket, we must round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries, we can calculate the calories of each type of pastry and then sum them.

Let's denote the calories of a normal cinnamon roll as CRR and a normal blueberry muffin as CBB. We are given that a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so the calories of a mini cinnamon roll can be expressed as (1/3)CRR. Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so the calories of a mini blueberry muffin can be expressed as (1/3)CBB.

We are given that CRR = 600 calories and CBB = 450 calories. Therefore, the calories of a mini cinnamon roll is (1/3)(600) = 200 calories, and the calories of a mini blueberry muffin is (1/3)(450) = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
Total calories = (number of mini cinnamon rolls) x (calories of a mini cinnamon roll) + (number of mini blueberry muffins) x (calories of a mini blueberry muffin)
Total calories = (200) x (200) + (300) x (150)
Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000
Total calories = 85,000

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we can employ the concept of arithmetic mean. The total number of Junebugs removed can be calculated by summing the individual daily counts and dividing by the number of days.

Let's denote the number of Junebugs removed on Monday as M, Tuesday and Wednesday as T, Thursday as Th, and Friday as F. We are given the following information:

M = 39
T = 2M
Th = 48
F = 57

We can express T in terms of M: T = 2M = 2(39) = 78

Now, we can calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:

Total = M + T + Th + F
= 39 + 78 + 48 + 57
= 262

Since there are 5 days in total, the average number of Junebugs removed per day can be calculated as:

Average = Total / Number of days
= 262 / 5
= 52.4

The final answer is: $\boxed{52.4}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus, the distance traveled is:
d_bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car, the distance traveled is:
d_car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

The difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car is:
d_bus - d_car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can utilize a simple arithmetic approach. Let's denote the number of bouncy balls as x. We know that the total number of toys Sophie has now is 62, and the initial number of toys is the sum of the blocks, stuffed animals, and rings, which is 31 + 8 + 9 = 48.

We can set up the equation: x + 48 = 62

To solve for x, we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

x = 62 - 48
x = 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + (P + 10) + J = 100
2. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age: P = (P + 10) + J

We can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation 2P + J = 90:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation P + J = 35:

(P + 10) + J + J = 35

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 25

Now we have two equations:

P + J = 35
P + 2J = 25

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(P + 2J) - (P + J) = 25 - 35

This simplifies to:

J = -10

However, this solution is not valid since age cannot be negative. We need to re-examine our previous steps.

Upon re-examining our previous steps, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption. Let's re-evaluate the system of equations.

We can rewrite the second equation as:

P = J + 10

Substitute this expression for P into the first equation:

(J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

3J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3J = 80

Divide both sides by 3:

J = 80/3

Now that we have J, we can find P:

P = J + 10
P = 80/3 + 10

To add 10 to 80/3, we need a common denominator:

P = (80/3) + (30/3)
P = 110/3

The final answer is: $\boxed{36.67}$"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each received 2 water balloons, resulting in a total of 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon to this initial count yields a preliminary total of 9 balloons.

Next, we must consider the additional balloons provided by Maria's mother. Since each of the 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends) received 3 more balloons, we can calculate the total number of additional balloons as 5 * 3 = 15.

Combining the initial 9 balloons with the 15 additional balloons, we arrive at a total of 9 + 15 = 24 water balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available for display. The charity group has received 10 individuals donating 5 boxes each, resulting in a total of 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Given that each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the required number of tables by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already possesses 15 tables. To determine the number of new tables needed, we subtract the existing tables from the total required: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group requires 15 new tables to accommodate the donated and existing items.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we must first calculate the total distance spat by each individual. 

Zoey's total distance spat can be calculated as the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's total distance spat can be calculated as the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both individuals is the sum of their individual distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2, as there are two individuals: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of widgets produced per hour, the number of hours worked per day, and the number of days worked per month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400

Next, we calculate the total revenue generated by each machine by multiplying the total number of widgets produced by the selling price of each widget, which is $6.

Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we subtract the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000.

Difference in revenue: $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of Cameron's decision, we can calculate the total cost of both options and compare them.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to stay for 5 additional hours, we need to calculate the cost of these extra hours. The hotel charges an additional 70 pesos per hour for hours beyond the initial 12 hours. Therefore, the cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 × 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional 5 hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, we can calculate the cost of the full 24 hours: 1600 pesos.

Cameron's decision to opt for the extended stay results in a cost savings of 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Let's break down the problem into two components: the hay required for the goats and the hay required for the sheep.

The hay needed for the goats can be calculated as 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.

For the sheep, we are given that each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. This can be expressed as 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds per sheep. Therefore, the total hay needed for the sheep is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay required is the sum of the hay needed for the goats and the sheep, which is 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total."
"To determine John's disposable income after purchasing the pencils, we must first calculate his total earnings and subsequent expenditures.

Given that John earns $50 per hour and worked for 6 hours, his total earnings can be calculated as:

Total Earnings = Hourly Wage * Hours Worked
Total Earnings = $50 * 6
Total Earnings = $300

Next, we subtract the cost of gas from his total earnings to determine his disposable income:

Disposable Income = Total Earnings - Gas Expenses
Disposable Income = $300 - $50
Disposable Income = $250

Subsequently, John purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, resulting in an additional expenditure of:

Pencil Expenses = Number of Pencils * Cost per Pencil
Pencil Expenses = 5 * $10
Pencil Expenses = $50

Now, we subtract the pencil expenses from his disposable income to determine the amount available for depositing into the bank:

Available Funds = Disposable Income - Pencil Expenses
Available Funds = $250 - $50
Available Funds = $200

Finally, John intends to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with:

Remaining Funds = Available Funds - Bank Deposit
Remaining Funds = $200 - $100
Remaining Funds = $100

To determine how many 25-dollar pens John can purchase with his remaining funds, we can divide the remaining funds by the cost of a single pen:

Number of Pens = Remaining Funds / Cost per Pen
Number of Pens = $100 / $25
Number of Pens = 4

The final answer is 4."
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can utilize the information provided. Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, resulting in a total of 20 * 15 = 300 letters.

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This implies that the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig's brother is 300 + 50 = 350.

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drills, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total, the total number of children can be calculated as follows:

Total number of children = Number of children per row * Number of rows
Total number of children = 8 * 7
Total number of children = 56

Therefore, the total number of children participating in the mass drills is 56."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. With 29 pupils in the class, each receiving 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles distributed is:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we consider the teacher's available coupons, which can be redeemed for 100 bottles each. The total number of bottles the teacher can obtain is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can obtain:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

Therefore, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

The final answer is: $\boxed{842}$"
"To determine the total cost incurred by Patty's Plumbing for the repair job, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts.

The labor cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). This yields a labor cost of $78.75.

The total fixed charge is $40.

The cost of parts is given as $60.

The total cost is the sum of the labor cost, total fixed charge, and the cost of parts. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Labor Cost + Total Fixed Charge + Cost of Parts
Total Cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total Cost = $178.75

The final answer is: $178.75"
"To determine the amount James was out, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial cost of the CDs and the revenue generated from selling some of them.

First, let's calculate the initial cost of the CDs before the discount. The total cost of the CDs can be found by multiplying the number of CDs by the price per CD:

Total Cost = Number of CDs × Price per CD
Total Cost = 10 × $15
Total Cost = $150

Next, we need to calculate the discount amount. Since James received a 40% discount, we can find the discount amount by multiplying the total cost by the discount percentage (as a decimal):

Discount Amount = Total Cost × Discount Percentage
Discount Amount = $150 × 0.4
Discount Amount = $60

Now, let's calculate the revenue James generated from selling 5 CDs at $40 each:

Revenue from Selling CDs = Number of CDs Sold × Price per CD
Revenue from Selling CDs = 5 × $40
Revenue from Selling CDs = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the revenue from selling the CDs from the initial cost:

Amount James Was Out = Total Cost - Revenue from Selling CDs
Amount James Was Out = $150 - $200
Amount James Was Out = -$50

Since James was out $50, he incurred a loss.

Final answer: $50"
"To determine the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we can calculate the total value of each type of crop and then sum them together.

The total value of the yams can be calculated as 6 * $1.5, which equals $9. The total value of the sweet potatoes is 10 * $2, resulting in $20. Lastly, the total value of the carrots is 4 * $1.25, yielding $5.

To find the overall total, we add these values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into distinct phases and calculate the time spent in each phase.

Let's denote the total distance as D, the initial swimming speed as S1, and the final swimming speed as S2. We are given that D = 20 miles, S1 = 2 miles per hour, and S2 = S1/2 = 1 mile per hour.

Phase 1: James swims 60% of the distance at S1.
Distance covered in Phase 1 = 0.6D = 0.6(20) = 12 miles
Time spent in Phase 1 = Distance / S1 = 12 / 2 = 6 hours

Phase 2: James rests for half the time spent in Phase 1.
Rest time = 0.5(6) = 3 hours

Phase 3: James swims the remaining distance at S2.
Distance covered in Phase 3 = D - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8 miles
Time spent in Phase 3 = Distance / S2 = 8 / 1 = 8 hours

Total time = Time in Phase 1 + Rest time + Time in Phase 3
Total time = 6 + 3 + 8
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be expressed as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation 7x - 40 = 70 to find the value of x.

Solving for x, we get:
7x - 40 = 70
7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110
x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

However, since the number of loaves must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a loaf. Therefore, the bakery had approximately 15 loaves of bread last Friday.

To find the current number of loaves the bakery has, we can multiply the number of loaves Sam had by 7 and subtract 40:
7 * 15 - 40 = 105 - 40 = 65

The bakery has 65 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{65}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net change of -7. This can be represented as:

15 - 7 = 8

Subsequently, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates, which can be added to the previous total:

8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, Jasmine now has 13 stickers.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's break down the problem into two parts: the commission earned from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The commission for each copy of the New York Times is 10% of the cost, which can be expressed as 0.10 * $5. Similarly, the commission for each copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of the cost, which can be expressed as 0.08 * $15.

Now, we can calculate the total commission by multiplying the number of copies sold for each newspaper by the respective commission rates and adding the results.

Commission for the New York Times: 6 copies * 0.10 * $5 = $3
Commission for the Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * 0.08 * $15 = $12

Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

Given that Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can express this relationship as:

M = (1/2)L

Additionally, we know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, which can be represented as:

M = D - 5

We are also given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

Substituting D = 26 into the second equation, we get:

M = 26 - 5
M = 21

Now that we have found Marcus's age, we can substitute M = 21 into the first equation to solve for Leo's age:

21 = (1/2)L

To isolate L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

42 = L

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D, respectively. We are given the following information:

1. B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
2. B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)
3. B + A + D = 45 (Total points scored by all three teams)

We can use substitution to solve for A. From equation (1), we can express B in terms of A: B = A + 20.

Substituting this expression for B into equation (3), we get:

(A + 20) + A + D = 45

Combine like terms:

2A + D + 20 = 45

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2A + D = 25

Now, we can express D in terms of A using equation (2): D = B - 10. Substituting B = A + 20, we get:

D = (A + 20) - 10
D = A + 10

Substituting this expression for D into the previous equation, we get:

2A + (A + 10) = 25

Combine like terms:

3A + 10 = 25

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3A = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can utilize the concept of linear density. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and each paper is 2 pages thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

Let's denote the number of pages per inch as p. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the total number of pages per inch is 2. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

p = 2 pages/inch

Now, we can use the formula for linear density to find the total number of pages:

Total number of pages = p * thickness
= 2 pages/inch * 1.5 inches
= 3 pages

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To determine the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we must first calculate the total minutes he spent stapling reports. The time interval from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM can be broken down into two segments: 4 hours (from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) and 11 hours (from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM).

The total minutes in 4 hours is 4 × 60 = 240 minutes.
The total minutes in 11 hours is 11 × 60 = 660 minutes.

The total minutes spent stapling reports is the sum of these two intervals: 240 + 660 = 900 minutes.

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by dividing the total minutes by 15.

Total reports = 900 / 15 = 60

Therefore, Vince stapled 60 reports in total.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we must consider the time she spent sleepwalking and her early morning wake-up time.

First, we calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.:

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. = 3 hours 22 minutes = 182 minutes

Total minutes slept = 120 + 135 + 23 + 182 = 460 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those minutes from the total:
460 - 5 = 455 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{455}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we can break down the problem into two components: measuring cups and measuring spoons.

First, we need to calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, and he has 24 measuring cups, we can set up a proportion to find the number of measuring spoons:

Let x be the number of measuring spoons. Then, the proportion is:
2/3 = x / 24

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
2 * 24 = 3x
48 = 3x
x = 48 / 3
x = 16

So, Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups, and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the initial number of occupied beds, which is 1/5 of the total capacity of 1000 beds.

Occupied beds = (1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

Next, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted into the hospital over a 2-week period. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days in 2 weeks is 14.

Daily admissions = 50 patients
Total admissions in 2 weeks = 50 * 14 = 700 patients

Now, we can calculate the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of occupied beds.

Unoccupied beds = Initial occupied beds - Total admissions in 2 weeks
= 200 - 700
= -500

However, the number of unoccupied beds cannot be negative, as it represents a count of beds. This indicates an error in our calculation. The correct approach is to subtract the total number of admissions from the total capacity of the hospital.

Unoccupied beds = Total capacity - Total admissions in 2 weeks
= 1000 - 700
= 300 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. 

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails per day and 7 of them are work emails, the number of non-work emails is:

Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we need to find the number of emails to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family, so:

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find the number of emails to her boyfriend. One-third of the non-work emails are sent to her boyfriend, so:

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between Shawna's and Aliya's ages, and subsequently, Shawna's father's age.

Given that Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3, as Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3 = 9 years

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5 = 45 years

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. Let's denote the actual number of attendees as x. Since Kelly stated that Courtney overestimated the number by 20%, we can set up the following equation:

x + 0.20x = 48

Combine like terms:

1.20x = 48

Divide both sides by 1.20:

x = 48 / 1.20

x = 40

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of basketballs, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of basketballs carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls can be represented as 2x. Similarly, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls can be represented as 2(2x) = 4x.

The total number of basketballs is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, which can be expressed as:

Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4x + 2x + x
Total balls = 7x

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, which allows us to solve for x:

2 = 2x
x = 1

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the total number of basketballs:

Total balls = 7x
Total balls = 7(1)
Total balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the third day. Since the pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29.

The total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is given by the sum of the holes dug on the first three days and the holes dug on the fourth day: 10 + 13 + 6 + x. We are also given that this total is equal to four times the number of holes dug by the end of the third day, which is 4 * 29.

Equating these two expressions, we get:

10 + 13 + 6 + x = 4 * 29

Combine like terms:

29 + x = 116

Subtract 29 from both sides:

x = 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of corn chips Amora, Lainey, and Collins received as A, L, and C, respectively. We are given that A = L = 70 and C = A + 15.

We can express the total number of corn chips as the sum of the individual amounts: A + L + C. Substituting the given values, we have:

A + L + C = 70 + 70 + (70 + 15)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

A + L + C = 70 + 70 + 70 + 15
A + L + C = 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To determine the total cost of the travel, we can calculate the additional amount required for the travel expenses, which is 50% of the cost of the supplies. This can be expressed as 0.5 × $400.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + 0.5 × $400
= $400 + $200
= $600

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can substitute the expression for X from equation (2) into equation (1):
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation (3) into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we have found A, we can find S by substituting A into equation (3):
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can express this relationship as:

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we can multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode:

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can utilize the concept of vector addition. The bird's displacement can be represented as the sum of three vectors: the initial displacement south, the subsequent displacement north, and the final displacement south.

Let's denote the initial displacement south as vector A, the displacement north as vector B, and the final displacement south as vector C. The magnitude of each vector can be calculated as follows:

|A| = 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles
|B| = 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles
|C| = 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird's final position is the same as her initial position, the net displacement south is the sum of vectors A and C, and the net displacement north is equal to vector B. Therefore, we can calculate the net displacement south as:

|A + C| = |A| + |C| = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

The net displacement north is equal to vector B, which is 36 miles. To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

√(|A + C|^2 + |B|^2) = √(410^2 + 36^2) = √(168100 + 1296) = √169396 ≈ 412.92 miles

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is approximately 413 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{413}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we must consider the cumulative distribution of brownies throughout the day. 

Initially, Greta made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. This represents a base quantity, which we'll denote as B. At the office party, she received an additional 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies, bringing the total to B + 6. Her friends then contributed 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home, further increasing the total to B + 6 + 48. 

The total number of brownies can be expressed as B + 54. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were consumed, which can be represented as 1.5 * 12 = 18. The number of brownies left over can be calculated as (B + 54) - 18.

To find the value of B, we can set up an equation: B + 54 - 18 = B + 36. However, this equation is not necessary, as we can directly calculate the number of brownies left over by subtracting the consumed brownies from the total.

Brownies left over = (B + 54) - 18
= B + 36

Since we know that Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies, we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

Brownies left over = 12 + 36
= 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into three separate calculations.

First, we calculate Nani's brother's age, which is twice Nani's age: 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we calculate Nani's sister's age, which is 25% younger than Nani's age. To find 25% of Nani's age, we multiply his age by 0.25: 0.25 * 8 = 2 years. Then, we subtract this value from Nani's age to find his sister's age: 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we can calculate the total age of the family members by adding the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time required to string all 12 racquets, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the time spent on each type of string and summing them up.

Let's denote the time spent on synthetic gut strings as S, polyester strings as P, and hybrid sets as H. We are given the following information:

- Number of synthetic gut strings: 3
- Number of polyester strings: 5
- Number of hybrid sets: 4

We also know the time spent on each type of string:
- Time for synthetic gut: 15 minutes/racquet
- Time for polyester string: 22 minutes/racquet
- Time for hybrid sets: 18 minutes/racquet

Using the formula for total time (T) as the sum of the time spent on each type of string, we can write the equation:

T = S + P + H

Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 3(15) + 5(22) + 4(18)

T = 45 + 110 + 72

T = 227 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to string all 12 racquets is 227 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{227}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. The cost of the first two phones is $600 each, resulting in a total of 2 x $600 = $1200. 

For the remaining phones, we note that each subsequent phone is half the price of the initial phone, which is $300. Since there are three remaining phones, the total cost for these phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

The overall cost is the sum of the costs of the first two phones and the remaining phones, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize the concept of addition. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let C represent the number of players in Carlton's team and Z represent the number of players in Zeke's team. The equation can be written as:

Z = C + 7

We are also given that C = 13. Substituting this value into the equation, we can solve for Z:

Z = 13 + 7
Z = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we can add the number of players in each team:

Total players = C + Z
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2(l + w)

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we can calculate the total number of slats required by multiplying the perimeter by 2:

Total wooden slats = P * 2
Total wooden slats = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for the fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she initially acquired: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges she distributed to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she retained: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, we can calculate the number of oranges she had left after distributing some to her mom and sister: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Since she sold the remaining oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we must first establish the number of states in each nation. The United States of America has 50 states. 

India, having more than half the number of states as the USA, can be calculated by adding 4 to half of the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25, and adding 4 yields 29 states in India.

Now, we can calculate the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8
= $39

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the amount saved from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
= $39 - $14
= $25

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
= $25 / $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To determine the number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cherries Jerry has as 'x'. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Richard has 20 cherries, we can express this relationship as:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = 20 + 10

However, this equation is not directly relevant to finding the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries. We can instead set up an equation based on the total number of cherries and the information provided:

Total cherries = Robert's cherries + Jerry's cherries
60 = 30 + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60 - 30
x = 30

This indicates that Jerry has 30 cherries. Now, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

Difference = Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries
= 30 - 30
= 0

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on each day, and then multiplying these quantities by their respective prices.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We are given that G = 10. On Sunday, the number of gingerbread boxes sold is G + 5, and the number of apple pie boxes sold is A - 4.

We can express the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday as A = 10 - 4 = 6.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for each day:

Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: 10G = 10(6) = $60
Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: (G + 5)6 = (10 + 5)6 = 15(6) = $90
Earnings from apple pie on Saturday: 6A = 6(10) = $60
Earnings from apple pie on Sunday: (A - 4)15 = (6 - 4)15 = 2(15) = $30

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $60 + $30 = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Given that she will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days, the total number of hours is:

4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Since each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces and she reappplies every hour, the total amount of sunscreen needed is 32 hours. To find the number of bottles required, we can divide the total hours by the amount of sunscreen reapplied per hour:

32 hours / 1 hour/bottle = 32 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 32 bottles of sunscreen.

32"
"To determine the prices of the two cars, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can express this relationship as:

Red car price = Blue car price - (40% of Blue car price)

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Red car price = Blue car price - (0.4 × Blue car price)

We are given that the price of the blue car is $100. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Red car price = $100 - (0.4 × $100)
Red car price = $100 - $40
Red car price = $60

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

The price of the blue car is $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that E = 19. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation:

24 = D/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 yields D = 48.

Additionally, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation:

24 = 2B

Dividing both sides by 2 yields B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We can express this as D + B.

D + B = 48 + 12

D + B = 60

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne had, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to establish the number of beads given by each individual. Her mother provided 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which can be expressed as 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which can be calculated as 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we can calculate the total number of beads by adding the beads from each source: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of crawfish Joe caught, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the amount of crawfish he caught each day and then summing these values.

Let's denote the amount of crawfish caught on Thursday as T, Friday as F, and Saturday as S. We are given the following information:

T = 3 pounds
F = 4T
S = F/2

We can express F and S in terms of T:

F = 4T = 4(3) = 12 pounds
S = F/2 = 12/2 = 6 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total amount of crawfish caught by summing the amounts caught each day:

Total = T + F + S = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can determine the number of servings by dividing the total amount by 3:

Number of servings = Total / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the average shoe size, we must first establish the size of Charlie's boots in relation to Sophie's. Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as 5 x 5 = 25.

The average shoe size can be found by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average shoe size is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of plants required to fill the flower bed, we must first calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the bed. 

The length of the bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 111 * 12 = 1332 inches. Given that each plant occupies a space of 12 inches (width) + 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) = 30 inches, we can fit 1332 / 30 = 44.4 plants in the bed. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to purchase 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother consumes half the amount of pretzels Edgar does, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. The ratio of Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption to Edgar's daily pretzel consumption is 1:2, or 1/2. We can set up the following proportion:

x / 18 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 18

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption by multiplying this value by 7:

9 pretzels/day × 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then summing the results.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as follows:

5 baskets × 3 petunias per basket × $3.00 per petunia = 5 × 3 × $3.00 = $45.00

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as:

5 baskets × 2 vines per basket × $2.50 per vine = 5 × 2 × $2.50 = $25.00

The total cost is the sum of these two values:

Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we must first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

Let's denote the number of roses as 'r'. Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the total amount of soil used for roses is 'r' pounds. 

The total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations can be calculated as follows:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, we can set up the following equation:
r + 27 = 30

Solving for 'r', we get:
r = 30 - 27
r = 3

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can afford to purchase in a year, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate her monthly savings, which is 25% of her monthly income. This can be expressed as:

Monthly savings = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate the number of pairs she can afford to purchase in a month by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a single pair:

Number of pairs per month = $500 / $1,000 = 0.5 pairs

To find the total number of pairs she can afford in a year, we multiply the number of pairs per month by 12:

Total pairs per year = 0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs

Therefore, Jessica can afford to purchase 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the task into two components: peeling and cooking.

First, let's analyze the peeling process. Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 6
Time = 15 minutes

Next, let's analyze the cooking process. Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Shrimp / Shrimp per Minute
Time = 90 / 30
Time = 3 minutes

Since these tasks are performed sequentially, we can add the times to find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp:

Total Time = Peeling Time + Cooking Time
Total Time = 15 + 3
Total Time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we can model the cooling and warming effects as a system of differential equations. Let's denote the initial temperature as x, the cooling rate on low as α = 2, the cooling rate on high as β = 3, and the warming rate as γ = 2.

The differential equation for the temperature change over time can be represented as:

dx/dt = -α + β * (1 - (x - x0)/t) - γ * (t - t0)

where x0 is the initial temperature, t0 is the time when the air conditioner is turned off, and t is the current time.

We can break down the problem into three time intervals:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours: 0 ≤ t ≤ 3
2. The air conditioner runs on high for 4 hours: 3 ≤ t ≤ 7
3. The air conditioner is off for 2 hours: 7 ≤ t ≤ 9

We can solve the differential equation for each interval and then combine the results to find the final temperature.

For the first interval (0 ≤ t ≤ 3), the differential equation simplifies to:

dx/dt = -2 + 3 * (1 - x/3)

Solving this equation, we get:

x(t) = 3 - 2 * (1 - (1/3) * t)

Evaluating this expression at t = 3, we get:

x(3) = 3 - 2 * (1 - 1/3 * 3) = 3 - 2 * (1 - 1) = 3

For the second interval (3 ≤ t ≤ 7), the differential equation simplifies to:

dx/dt = -2 + 3 * (1 - (x - 3)/4)

Solving this equation, we get:

x(t) = 3 + 2 * (1 - (1/4) * (t - 3))

Evaluating this expression at t = 7, we get:

x(7) = 3 + 2 * (1 - (1/4) * (7 - 3)) = 3 + 2 * (1 - 1/4 * 4) = 3 + 2 * (1 - 1) = 3

For the third interval (7 ≤ t ≤ 9), the differential equation simplifies to:

dx/dt = -2

Solving this equation, we get:

x(t) = x(7) - 2 * (t - 7)

Evaluating this expression at t = 9, we get:

x(9) = 3 - 2 * (9 - 7) = 3 - 2 * 2 = 3 - 4 = -1

The final temperature is x(9) = -1. To find the temperature difference from the starting temperature, we subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature:

ΔT = x(0) - x(9) = x - (-1) = x + 1

Since we don't know the initial temperature x, we can't determine the exact value of ΔT. However, we can express the final temperature difference as a function of the initial temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can express Bill's age as 3(30 + x).

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3(30 + x) = 90 + 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 + 3x = 165

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

3x = 75

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 25

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting x from 30:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30 - 25 = 5

However, this is not the correct answer, as we are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad, we can add 75 to Bill's age when his dad saw the comet to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 5 + 75 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of checks written per month: 1 (electric bill) + 1 (gas bill) + 2 (church) = 4 checks per month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly check total by 12 to obtain the annual check total: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year.

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we can start by calculating the total number of flights it makes in a day. Given that the second plane's 44 trips to Poland constitute half of the first plane's total trips, we can establish the first plane's total trips as 44 * 2 = 88.

Since the first plane's flights are divided into three-quarters for Greece and the remaining quarter split between France and Germany, we can calculate the number of flights to France as follows:

Let x be the total number of flights to France and Germany. We know that 3/4 of the total flights (88) are to Greece, so the remaining 1/4 is to France and Germany. This can be expressed as:

3/4 * 88 = 66 (flights to Greece)

The remaining flights, x, are split equally between France and Germany, so we can set up the equation:

x = 88 - 66
x = 22

Since x is the total number of flights to France and Germany, and they are split equally, the number of flights to France is:

x/2 = 22/2
x/2 = 11

Therefore, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in a day."
"To determine the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to establish the duration of each wolf's howl. Let's denote the duration of Tobias' howl as T, Chikote's as C, and Igneous' as I. We are given that T = 20 seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can express this as C = 2T. Furthermore, Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so I = T + C.

Substituting the expression for C into the equation for I, we get I = T + 2T = 3T. Now we can substitute the value of T into the equation for I: I = 3(20) = 60 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls: T + C + I = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Next, we subtract the total amount received from his parents from the cost of the trousers to find the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings: $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the age of Wilfred, we can utilize the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

Given that the total age of the children is 20, we can express this as:

H + W + 3 + 4 = 20

Since Helene is twice the average age of the group, we know that H = 2 * (20 / 4) = 10.

Substituting H = 10 into the equation, we get:

10 + W + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:

W = 3

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to consider the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. Walter initially collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from a fund he set up online, resulting in a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, it is essential to note that Walter's lawyer's contribution is contingent upon the total amount collected by Walter, not the amount collected by Walter's neighbors or the online fund. Therefore, we should consider the total amount collected by Walter, which is $2000.

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which will be subtracted from the total amount collected. Therefore, the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that each guest brought 15 cookies and the bride decided to give half of the total cookies to the church, we can calculate the number of cookies donated as follows:

Total number of cookies = 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies
Number of cookies donated = 1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can calculate the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies donated by the number of cookies per person:

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the total number of slices as 'T'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can express the number of slices for the adults as 2x and for the kids as x.

Given that the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation: 2x + x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

Now that we know x = 2, we can determine the number of slices for the adults (2x) and kids (x). The number of slices for the adults is 2*2 = 4, and the number of slices for the kids is 2.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult receives approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66.67\%}$"
"To determine the time available for record-keeping, we must first calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments. 

The time spent on inpatient rounds can be calculated as follows: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes. 

Similarly, the time spent on appointments is 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes.

The total time spent is the sum of these two: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Converting this to hours, we have 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to prepare the cake, we must consider the total time required for each stage of the process. 

The total time for cake preparation can be calculated as follows:

- Preparation time: 20 minutes (mixing batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes
- Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Given that the desired serving time is 5:00 pm, we can calculate the latest start time by subtracting the total preparation time from the serving time.

Latest start time = Serving time - Total preparation time
= 5:00 pm - 3 hours
= 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan should start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, and their combined sales can be represented as 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes, we can set up the following equation:

Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box.

Since 8 boxes contain 64 chocolate bars, we can express this relationship as:

8x = 64

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 64 ÷ 8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons. The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. Therefore, the weekly cost of students' lessons is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. The monthly cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

The final answer is $480."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, so her total number of chocolate bars can be represented as 7y.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation: 4x = 64.

Solving for x, we get x = 64 / 4 = 16.

We are also given that Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation: 7y = 56.

Solving for y, we get y = 56 / 7 = 8.

To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha, we subtract y from x: x - y = 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of female porcupines, which is 3/5 of the total population. 

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

Therefore, the total population of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth, in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool as 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep, we can substitute these values into the formula:

V = lwh
V = 14 x 25 x 4
V = 1400 cubic feet

To convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons, we can use the conversion factor: 1 cubic foot ≈ 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can calculate the total gallons of water needed as follows:

Total gallons = V x 7.48
Total gallons = 1400 x 7.48
Total gallons ≈ 10648 gallons

Finally, to determine the cost of filling the pool, we can multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:

Cost = Total gallons x 0.10
Cost ≈ 10648 x 0.10
Cost ≈ $1064.80

The cost to fill the pool is approximately $1064.80."
"In this problem, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic sequence. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so the number of blue sticks can be represented as 9 + 5 = 14. 

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, which can be expressed as 14 - 3 = 11.

To find the total number of sticks, we can simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy can be found by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into distinct categories and apply basic arithmetic operations.

First, we calculate the number of students over 16 years old: 3000 / 2 = 1500.

Next, we find the number of male students over 16 years old, which is one-fourth of the total students over 16: 1500 / 4 = 375.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500.

We then calculate the number of male students under 16, which is half of the total students under 16: 1500 / 2 = 750.

Now, we can find the number of female students over 16 years old by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

Similarly, we find the number of female students under 16 by subtracting the number of male students under 16 from the total students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Finally, we calculate the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps Bethany can run more than Quinn, we need to first establish the individual lap counts for each person. 

Given that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour, we can calculate the lap counts for the other individuals based on the provided relationships:

- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we can calculate the difference in lap counts between Bethany and Quinn by subtracting Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can analyze the water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the charge loss of the power bank as an exponential decay process. Let's denote the initial charge as x. The power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then loses 7% of the total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.

We can express the charge remaining after 5 hours as:

x - (0.09x)5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the charge remaining can be expressed as:

0.55x - (0.07x)3 = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% after 8 hours, we can set up the equation:

0.34x = 0.28x

However, this equation does not make sense, as the charge cannot be negative. Let's re-examine the problem.

We can express the charge remaining after 8 hours as:

x - (0.09x)5 - (0.07x)3 = 0.28x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 0.45x - 0.21x = 0.28x

This equation doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem again.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (0.09x)5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (0.07x)3 = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can calculate her total weekly earnings and then divide the required savings by her weekly earnings.

Janet's total hourly wage is $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Her weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings = Total hourly wage * Hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $1000/week

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save the down payment:

Number of weeks = Required savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1000/week
Number of weeks = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits and subtract it from his initial $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on other fruits:

3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 × $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, the amount left after purchasing other fruits is $10 - $10.25 = -$0.25. However, this indicates an error in the initial calculation, as Jamaar cannot spend a negative amount. Let's re-evaluate the total amount spent on other fruits.

Correcting the calculation:
3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 × $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs Anne kept from the total number of packs: 15 - 2 = 13.

Next, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack: 13 * 60 = 780.

Finally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends to determine the number of pieces each friend received: 780 ÷ 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, where the price increase is compounded annually. The formula for exponential growth is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t

where P(t) is the price after t years, P0 is the initial price, r is the annual growth rate (as a decimal), and t is the number of years.

In this case, the initial price (P0) is $120, the annual growth rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and we want to find the price after 3 years (t = 3).

P(3) = 120 * (1 + 0.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * (1.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * 1.157625
P(3) ≈ 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the total number of pictures among the albums. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were designated for selfies, and each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of selfies as:

3 x 9 = 27

Similarly, as 2 albums were allocated for portraits, and each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the number of portraits as:

2 x 9 = 18

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the information provided. Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of reading as follows:

Rate = Number of pages / Time taken
Rate = 3 pages / 10 minutes
Rate = 0.3 pages per minute

Now, we can calculate the time it takes James to read 18 pages by dividing the total number of pages by the rate:

Time = Total pages / Rate
Time = 18 pages / 0.3 pages per minute
Time = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. 

Next, 15 guests opted for a late checkout, reducing the number of guests to 76 - 15 = 61.

In the afternoon, the number of guests who checked in is twice the number of those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. Therefore, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-in is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday, which is triple the number he picked on Wednesday. This can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Next, we add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

Therefore, John has a total of 22 bananas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can calculate the proportions as follows:

Let's denote the total number of questions as N. We know that 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4N. The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so the number of average and difficult questions is (1 - 0.4)N / 2 = 0.3N.

We are given that Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 0.4N = 0.3N. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 0.3N = 0.15N.

The total number of points Aries is sure to get is the sum of the points from easy, average, and difficult questions:
0.3N + 0.15N = 0.45N

Since we know the total number of questions is 60, we can substitute N = 60:
0.45N = 0.45 * 60 = 27

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 27 points.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach, utilizing the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as '2x', given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total revenue from the sales can be represented by the equation: 12x + 4(2x) = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12x + 8x = 120

Combining like terms, we obtain: 20x = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we find: x = 6

Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is twice the number of large ones, the total number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x = 2 * 6 = 12

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in a week, we can apply the principle of linear summation. Given that the family consists of three members with daily sandwich consumption rates of 5, 4, and 2 sandwiches, respectively, we can calculate the total daily consumption as follows:

Total daily consumption = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly consumption = 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days = 77 sandwiches

Therefore, the family consumes 77 sandwiches in a week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total revenue from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

Let's denote the number of cookies sold as C and the number of cupcakes sold as U. We are given that C = 80 and U = 60. The price of each cookie is $1, and the price of each cupcake is $4. Therefore, the total revenue from cookies is $1 * C = $1 * 80 = $80, and the total revenue from cupcakes is $4 * U = $4 * 60 = $240.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from cookies and cupcakes: Total Revenue = $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne then gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is 2 * $10 = $20.

To find Suzanne's remaining earnings, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total revenue: Remaining Earnings = Total Revenue - $20 = $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Given that the Smith twins each found 30 eggs, and all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we can calculate the number of eggs found by the friends as follows:

Total eggs = 100
Eggs found by twins = 30
Eggs not found = 10

Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by twins - Eggs not found
= 100 - 30 - 10
= 60

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we establish the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe, which is 36 pounds per day. With 40 dwarves, the collective daily ore mining capacity is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily capacity by the number of days in the month, which is 30. Therefore, the total ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"Given the proportional relationship between the package sizes and prices, we can establish a ratio of price to quantity for the first two packages. 

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. We can set up a proportion to relate the prices and quantities of the first two packages:

(3 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 4 * 3
3x = 12

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 12 / 3
x = 4

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $4.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can apply the concept of present value and the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan. Since Tom is paying 10% of the remaining amount owed each month, we can model this as a geometric series.

Let's denote the initial amount owed as $2000 and the monthly interest rate as 10% or 0.10. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:

S = a / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the infinite series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.

In this case, the first term (a) is the monthly payment, and the common ratio (r) is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. However, since we're looking for the monthly payment, we can rearrange the formula to solve for a:

a = S / (1 - r)
a = 2000 / (1 - 0.90)
a = 2000 / 0.10
a = $20,000

However, this is the total amount owed, not the monthly payment. To find the monthly payment, we can divide the total amount by the number of months. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of months, we'll assume it's an infinite series. In reality, this would be a perpetual loan, and the monthly payment would be the present value of the loan.

The correct monthly payment is $20,000.

The final answer is: $2000"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we can break down the problem into several steps. 

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the wind. Given that 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, we can express this as:

Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25
= 10

The remaining red balloons can be calculated as:

Remaining red balloons = Total red balloons - Number of red balloons that burst
= 25 - 10
= 15

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released when Sally accidentally dropped half of them. This can be expressed as:

Number of yellow balloons released = 12 / 2
= 6

The remaining yellow balloons can be calculated as:

Remaining yellow balloons = Total yellow balloons - Number of yellow balloons released
= 12 - 6
= 6

Now, we need to find the number of blue balloons Sally added to her collection. Given that 75% of the 8 blue balloons were added, we can express this as:

Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * 8
= 6

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red, yellow, and the newly added blue balloons:

Total number of balloons = Remaining red balloons + Remaining yellow balloons + Number of blue balloons added
= 15 + 6 + 6
= 27

Therefore, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can employ the concept of complementary probability. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events: (1) the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, and (2) the substitute teacher comes in.

Let's calculate the probability of each event:

P(normal teacher doesn't give an extension) = 0.5 (probability of a normal teacher) * 0.6 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.3
P(substitute teacher comes in) = 0.5 (probability of a substitute teacher) * 0.6 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.3

Since these events are mutually exclusive, we add their probabilities: P(not having to turn in homework) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6

Now, we can find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by subtracting the probability of not having to turn in homework from 1: P(having to turn in homework) = 1 - P(not having to turn in homework) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: P(having to turn in homework) = 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: $\boxed{40\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to calculate the remaining seats available after accounting for the allocated seats for graduates and faculty. This can be achieved by subtracting the total number of allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Let's denote the total capacity as C, the number of seats allocated for graduates as G, and the number of seats allocated for faculty as F. We are given that C = 6000, G = 950, and F = 300.

First, we calculate the total number of seats allocated:
Total allocated seats = G + F = 950 + 300 = 1250

Next, we subtract the total allocated seats from the total capacity to find the remaining seats:
Remaining seats = C - Total allocated seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive:
Tickets per graduate = Remaining seats / Number of graduates = 4750 / 950

Tickets per graduate = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can employ a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S. We are given the following relationships:

1. L = 75 (number of large beans required to fill Grandpa up)
2. M = 2L (number of medium beans is twice the number of large beans)
3. S = M/3 (number of small beans is one-third the number of medium beans)

Using the first two equations, we can express M in terms of L:

M = 2L
M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the third equation to find S:

S = M/3
S = 150/3
S = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we can employ the concept of total compensation and hourly rate. 

First, we need to determine her total daily income after accounting for parking expenses. This can be calculated as follows:

Daily income - Parking expenses = $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Next, we multiply this daily income by the number of days worked to obtain her total compensation:

$12 per day * 3 days = $36

Now, we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing the total compensation by the total number of hours worked:

$36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour

Therefore, Melissa's hourly wage after expenses is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we can employ the concept of arithmetic addition. 

First, we calculate the cost of the books: 3 books at 16 dollars each is equivalent to 3 × 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils: 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is equivalent to 3 × 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To determine the total time required for Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given parameters.

Given that the driveway is 24 feet wide and a bottle of soda is placed every 3 feet, the total number of bottles can be calculated as follows:

Number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between bottles
= 24 feet / 3 feet
= 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will need to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. The time taken for each move is 5 seconds. Therefore, the total time required can be calculated as:

Total time = Number of moves × Time per move
= 7 × 5 seconds
= 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that there are 40 apples in one box and he has two boxes, the total number of apples is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can calculate the number of packs by dividing the total number of apples by 8:

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples per pack
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes.

Final answer: 10"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from her initial amount of $50.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor bought 2 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 2 × $11 = $22. Similarly, the cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 3 × $6 = $18.

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. To find the amount of money Amor will have left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.

Final Answer: The final answer is $10."
"To calculate the break-even point, we can use the concept of present value of an annuity. Let's denote the number of years as 'n'. The present value of the annuity (PV) can be calculated using the formula:

PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where:
- PV = present value
- PMT = annual payment (in this case, the total amount to be earned: $300,000)
- r = annual interest rate (assuming a 0% interest rate, as the problem doesn't specify any interest rate)
- n = number of years

Since we're not considering interest, the formula simplifies to:

PV = PMT * n

We want to find 'n' when PV = $300,000. Rearranging the formula to solve for 'n', we get:

n = PV / PMT
n = $300,000 / $75,000
n = 4

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric required for the comforter, we must consider the increased dimensions due to the 2-foot extension on both length and width. The original bed dimensions are 6 feet by 8 feet. Adding 2 feet to both dimensions, we obtain the comforter's dimensions as 8 feet by 10 feet.

The area of the comforter can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width. Therefore, the area of the comforter is:

Area = Length × Width
Area = 8 ft × 10 ft
Area = 80 sq ft

Since the comforter is composed of two identical pieces, we must multiply the area by 2 to account for both pieces:

Total fabric required = 2 × 80 sq ft
Total fabric required = 160 sq ft

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three components: Monday's delivery, Tuesday's delivery, and Wednesday's delivery.

Let's denote Monday's delivery as M, Tuesday's delivery as T, and Wednesday's delivery as W. We are given the following information:

M = 425

T = (1/5)M + 17
T = (1/5)(425) + 17
T = 85 + 17
T = 102

W = 2T + 5
W = 2(102) + 5
W = 204 + 5
W = 209

Now, we can calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
Total = M + T + W
Total = 425 + 102 + 209
Total = 736

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736."
"To determine the total cost of the catering, we can employ the principle of linear summation. 

The cost of the chicken salad can be calculated as 10 individuals * $6.50 per individual, resulting in a total of $65. Similarly, the cost of the pasta salad is 6 individuals * $6 per individual, yielding a total of $36.

The total cost of the catering is the sum of these two values, which can be expressed as $65 + $36.

Total Cost = $65 + $36
Total Cost = $101

The final answer is: $101"
"To determine the average amount lost, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total amount lost and then dividing it by the number of races.

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as L1, the amount won in the second race as W2, and the amount lost in the third race as L3. We are given the following information:

L1 = $5
W2 = 2L1 + $1
L3 = 1.5W2

First, we can calculate W2 using the given equation:
W2 = 2L1 + $1
= 2($5) + $1
= $10 + $1
= $11

Next, we can calculate L3 using the given equation:
L3 = 1.5W2
= 1.5($11)
= $16.5

Now, we can calculate the total amount lost:
Total amount lost = L1 + L3
= $5 + $16.5
= $21.5

Finally, we can calculate the average amount lost:
Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."

We are provided with the following parameters:
- Number of countries in South America: 26
- Number of cities per country: 5
- Population per city: 1000

Using the fundamental principle of multiplication, we can calculate the total population as follows:

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Population per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we can calculate their individual heights and then find the absolute difference.

Xavier's height increase is 3 inches, and his initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. Therefore, his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's height increase is 2 inches, and his initial height was 50 inches. Therefore, his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier can be calculated as |52 - 51| = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the share of the first person, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person's share is $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we can employ the concept of total work done, which is a fundamental principle in physics and engineering. The total work done by the team can be calculated as the product of the number of days worked, the fraction of the day worked, and the number of painters.

Let's denote the total hours worked as W, the number of days worked as D, the fraction of the day worked as F, and the number of painters as N. We are given D = 21 days, F = 3/8, and N = 4.

The total work done can be expressed as:

W = D * F * N
W = 21 * (3/8) * 4
W = 21 * 3 * 4 / 8
W = 63 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can express the total hours worked as:

W = 63 hours / 24
W = 2.625 days

To find the hours worked per painter, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:

Hours per painter = W / N
Hours per painter = 2.625 / 4
Hours per painter = 0.65625 hours

Therefore, each painter worked 0.65625 hours.

The final answer is 0.65625."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first set as x, the number of balls retrieved in the second set as y, and the number of balls retrieved in the third set as z.

We are given that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, so we can express this as:

x = y + 4

We are also given that he retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, so we can express this as:

z = y/2

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 19

Substituting the expressions for x and z in terms of y, we get:

(y + 4) + y + (y/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2(y + 4) + 2y + y = 38

Combine like terms:

3y + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

3y = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 10

Now that we know y, we can find x and z:

x = y + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14

z = y/2 = 10/2 = 5

Therefore, Rory retrieved 14 balls in the first set.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can utilize the concept of exponential decay, which is a common method for modeling depreciation. The formula for exponential decay is given by:

A(t) = A0 * (1 - r)^t

where:
- A(t) is the value of the car at time t
- A0 is the initial value of the car (in this case, $20,000)
- r is the annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21 as a decimal)
- t is the number of years

We can apply this formula for each year from 2007 to 2010:

Year 2008: A(1) = 20,000 * (1 - 0.21) = 20,000 * 0.79 = 15,800
Year 2009: A(2) = 15,800 * (1 - 0.21) = 15,800 * 0.79 = 12,502
Year 2010: A(3) = 12,502 * (1 - 0.21) = 12,502 * 0.79 = 9,876.02

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9,876.02.

9,876.02"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the proportion of books written in languages other than English and German.

Given that half of the books are written in English and 10% are written in German, we can calculate the proportion of books written in these languages as follows:

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Since the remaining books are written in Spanish, we can calculate the number of Spanish books by subtracting the sum of English and German books from the total number of books:

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)
= 50 - (25 + 5)
= 50 - 30
= 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the remaining distance Bernice needs to drive, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. Given that she has already covered 325 kilometers, we can calculate the remaining distance by subtracting this value from the total distance between San Diego, California, and New York City, New York.

Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Distance already driven = 325 kilometers

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already driven
= 1955 - 325
= 1630 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

Final answer: 1630"
"To determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion. Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days by multiplying her daily consumption (8 cups) by the number of days (30) and then converting the result to gallons.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total cups = 8 cups/day × 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing by 16:

Total gallons = Total cups / 16
= 240 cups / 16
= 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, the train has 120 passengers. At the first stop, 20 more people board, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people disembark, and 100 people board, resulting in a net increase of 50 people. Therefore, the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people disembark, leading to a net decrease of 80 people. Thus, the final total is 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the total cost of the athletic gear, we can break down the costs of each item and apply the relevant mathematical operations.

The cost of the tank top is $10. The cost of the running shorts is $5 more than the tank top, which can be expressed as $10 + $5 = $15. The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price, resulting in a discounted price of $48 / 2 = $24. Additionally, Alison has a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks, which can be calculated as $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of all items together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we can employ the concept of area and unit conversion. Given that each tile has an area of 1 square foot (since it's a 1ft x 1ft tile), we can directly calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile.

Let's denote the total area of the kitchen floor as A (200 square feet) and the area of each tile as a (1 square foot). The number of tiles required can be calculated as:

Number of tiles = A / a
= 200 square feet / 1 square foot
= 200 tiles

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile (C):

Total cost = Number of tiles * C
= 200 tiles * $12 per tile
= $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"Given that James's insurance premium has increased by 60% due to an accident, we can calculate the new monthly premium as follows:

Let's denote the normal monthly premium as P. The increased premium can be represented as P + 0.6P, which is equal to the new monthly premium.

P + 0.6P = 1.6P

We are given that the normal monthly premium is $120. Therefore, we can substitute P = $120 into the equation:

1.6P = 1.6($120)
= $192

To find the yearly premium, we multiply the monthly premium by 12:

Yearly premium = $192 x 12
= $2304

The final answer is: $2304"
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of loads for each type of bed and then summing them.

Let's first calculate the total number of loads for twin beds: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads. Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we divide the total number of twin loads by 2 to find the number of loads per week: 208 / 2 = 104 twin loads per week. Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 105 twin loads per week.

Next, we calculate the total number of loads for the king bed: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads. Since the laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, we don't need to divide by any number. Therefore, the number of king loads per week remains 52.

Now, we can find the total number of loads per week by summing the twin and king loads: 105 + 52 = 157 loads per week.

Finally, we multiply the total number of loads per week by 52 weeks to find the total number of loads per year: 157 * 52 = 8,184 loads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8184}$"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

Given that they watch 4 movies every Saturday, and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, we can express this as:

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies
Total movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks = 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

The total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is the sum of these two values:

Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 16 + 8 = 24 movies

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch a total of 24 movies in 4 weeks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. 

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which equates to 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. 

To find the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can sum the stickers from the three years: 100 + 150 + 100 = 350 stickers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food, we can calculate the total daily consumption as 2 * 60 grams = 120 grams per day.

Now, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily consumption (120 grams) to find the number of days it will last:

720 grams / 120 grams per day = 6 days

Therefore, the cat food will last 6 days."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so her slices can be represented as 2x.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, which allows us to set up the equation x + 3 = 10. Solving for x, we get:

x + 3 = 10
x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we have found Jake's slices, we can determine Silvia's slices by multiplying Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2(7)
Silvia's slices = 14

With the number of slices each person ate known, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = 4x + 3
Total slices = 4(7) + 3
Total slices = 28 + 3
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we must consider the various expenses incurred by Hannah. 

First, we calculate the cost of the cast, which is a fixed amount of $200. Next, we calculate the cost of the visit, which is $300 per hour multiplied by 0.5 hours (since the visit is 30 minutes). This yields $150. 

The cost of the painkillers can be calculated by multiplying the cost per pill ($4) by the number of pills (30), resulting in $120. 

Lastly, we calculate the cost of parking, which is $6 per hour multiplied by 2 hours, equating to $12.

Now, we sum these costs to obtain the total cost of the doctor's visit: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the total number of emails he responds to per day and then multiply it by 5.

First, we need to find the number of emails that require a response. Since 20% of the emails James receives don't require a response, we can calculate this as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

The number of emails that require a response is then 80 - 16 = 64 emails.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week: 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. The number of classes that visited each day can be represented as an arithmetic sequence: 32, 64, 96, 30, 25.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, we have 5 terms (n = 5), a1 = 32, and an = 25. However, we must note that the sequence is not a simple arithmetic sequence due to the presence of the 30 classes on Thursday, which disrupts the arithmetic progression. Nevertheless, we can still calculate the total number of classes by summing the given values.

Let's calculate the sum of the classes that visited on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 32 + 64 + 96 = 192.

Now, we add the classes that visited on Thursday and Friday: 192 + 30 + 25 = 247.

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The final answer is: $\boxed{247}$"
"To calculate the average score, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean: 

Average = (Sum of all scores) / (Number of scores)

In this scenario, the sum of all scores is 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380, and the number of scores is 4.

Average = 380 / 4
Average = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we can calculate the total number of pizzas consumed by both groups and subtract this from the initial order.

The glee club consumed 70% of 20 pizzas, which can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team consumed 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas consumed is the sum of the pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, which is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas initially ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of mailing each type of coupon separately and then summing the results.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S = 1400.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 5 cents per unit, so the total cost for small coupons is 5S cents. Similarly, the cost of mailing big coupons is 15 cents per unit, so the total cost for big coupons is 15B cents.

The total cost of postage (C) can be expressed as the sum of the costs for small and big coupons: C = 5S + 15B.

Substituting the given values, we get C = 5(700) + 15(1400) = 3500 + 21000 = 26200 cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100: C = 26200 / 100 = 262 dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of postage is $262.

The final answer is: $262"
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark then ate 4 of these sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. The number of meatballs in these remaining sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6. The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser and multiply it by the amount each truck carried.

Let's first calculate the number of trucks that could not deliver the fertiliser. Since a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate this as:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = (1/4) * Total number of trucks
= (1/4) * 20
= 5 trucks

The number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is the difference between the total number of trucks and the number that could not deliver:
Number of trucks that delivered = Total number of trucks - Number of trucks that could not deliver
= 20 - 5
= 15 trucks

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount delivered is:
Total amount delivered = Number of trucks that delivered * Amount per truck
= 15 * 20 tons
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we can apply the concept of a discount to the total amount of butter required. Given that Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, which translates to 6 pounds of butter, and the store offers a promotion where one pound of butter is bought at full price and the next pound is bought at half price, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Let's denote the full price of butter as $p. The total cost of 6 pounds of butter can be expressed as:

Total Cost = (2 pounds * p) + (4 pounds * 0.5p)

Since the store offers a buy-one-get-one-half-off promotion, the effective price for 6 pounds of butter is:

Total Cost = 2p + 2p
Total Cost = 4p

Given that the full price of butter is $4.00 per pound, we can substitute p = $4.00 into the equation:

Total Cost = 4 * $4.00
Total Cost = $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we must first calculate the number of guests attending. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people declined the invitation.

Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined guests) = 41

The rental fee for the theater is $125 for a party of 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. To find the cost for the additional guests, we subtract the base number of guests from the total number of guests.

Additional guests = Total number of guests - Base number of guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Total cost = Base rental fee + Cost for additional guests = $125 + $126 = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To determine the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the initial amount of money they had as 'x'. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and Riza spent one-third of her money, and both ended up with $60, we can set up the following equation:

Maggie's money: (3/4)x = 60
Riza's money: (2/3)x = 60

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of each equation by the respective denominators to isolate x:

(3/4)x = 60
x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

(2/3)x = 60
x = 60 * (3/2)
x = 90

Since the initial amount of money they had must be the same, we can equate the two expressions for x:

80 = 90

This is a contradiction, indicating that the initial assumption that both Maggie and Riza had the same amount of money is incorrect. However, we can proceed with the assumption that they had the same amount of money initially, and solve for x using one of the equations.

Using the first equation, we can solve for x:

(3/4)x = 60
x = 60 * (4/3)
x = 80

Now that we know the initial amount of money they had, we can calculate the total amount spent:

Total amount spent = Maggie's money + Riza's money
= (3/4)x + (1/3)x
= (9/12)x + (4/12)x
= (13/12)x

Substituting x = 80, we get:

Total amount spent = (13/12) * 80
= 65.33

Now, we can calculate the amount of money they have left:

Amount left = Initial amount - Total amount spent
= 80 - 65.33
= 14.67

The two of them have $14.67 left.

The final answer is $14.67."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can employ a straightforward approach by first calculating the total daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then subtracting this value from the total weekly consumption.

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats per day as x. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the second monkey's daily consumption can be represented as x + 4. The third monkey's daily consumption can be represented as the total weekly consumption minus the combined daily consumption of the first two monkeys.

The total weekly consumption is 315 bananas. The combined daily consumption of the first two monkeys is 2x + 4. Therefore, the third monkey's daily consumption can be expressed as:

315 - (2x + 4)

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey's daily consumption can be calculated as:

(315 - (2x + 4)) / 7

We are given that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, so x = 10. Substituting this value into the expression, we get:

(315 - (2(10) + 4)) / 7
= (315 - 24) / 7
= 291 / 7
= 41.57

However, since the number of bananas must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as a fraction of a banana is not feasible in this context.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

Given that Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle, we can calculate the number of pieces he placed as 500 / 2 = 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and subtract that from the amount of money she has.

The cost of 15 roses can be calculated in two ways:

1. As a whole number of dozens: 15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
   1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

2. As individual roses: 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30

Since Jenny has $25, she doesn't have enough money to pay for the roses. However, we can calculate the change she would receive if she paid with a combination of dollars and quarters.

Let's assume she pays with 5 dollars and some quarters. The remaining amount she needs to pay is $30 - $5 = $25.

Since a quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters she needs to pay the remaining amount as follows:

$25 / $0.25 = 100 quarters

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that she is paying with 5 dollars and some quarters. Let's recalculate the number of quarters she needs to pay the remaining amount:

$25 - $5 = $20

$20 / $0.25 = 80 quarters

Since she is paying with 5 dollars, we need to add 5 dollars to the 80 quarters. To do this, we can convert the 5 dollars to quarters:

5 dollars * 4 quarters/dollar = 20 quarters

Now, we can add the 20 quarters to the 80 quarters:

80 quarters + 20 quarters = 100 quarters

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that she is paying with 5 dollars and some quarters. Let's recalculate the number of quarters she needs to pay the remaining amount:

"To calculate the total revenue generated by Terry, we can employ the concept of linear algebra and basic arithmetic operations. Let's break down the sales data into separate components and calculate the total revenue.

Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, which can be represented as 6 × $5.50. Similarly, he sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, represented as 9 × $11, and 20 sodas for $1.50 each, represented as 20 × $1.50.

Using the distributive property of multiplication, we can simplify these expressions:

6 × $5.50 = $33
9 × $11 = $99
20 × $1.50 = $30

Now, we can add these values to find the total revenue:

$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Therefore, Terry's total revenue is $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we can break down the problem into manageable intervals. 

Let's denote the arrival time of the first train as t1, the second train as t2, the third train as t3, and the fourth train as t4. We are given the following information:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes, so t1 = 10.
2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is equivalent to t2 = t1 + 30 = 40 minutes.
3. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the departure time of the second train is t2 + 5 = 45 minutes.
4. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is equivalent to t3 = t2 + 60 = 100 minutes.
5. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so its departure time is t3 = 100 minutes.
6. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is equivalent to t4 = t3 + 20 = 120 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the waiting time for each train:

- Waiting for the first train: t1 - t0 = 10 - 0 = 10 minutes
- Waiting for the second train: t2 - t1 = 45 - 10 = 35 minutes
- Waiting for the third train: t3 - t2 = 100 - 40 = 60 minutes
- Waiting for the fourth train: t4 - t3 = 120 - 100 = 20 minutes

The total waiting time for Paul is the sum of these intervals: 10 + 35 + 60 + 20 = 125 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{125}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can use a simple division problem. Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the total number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

Let's perform the calculation:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, then express it as a percentage of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as P. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, the sale price is 0.75P. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 0.75P = 0.9P.

The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is P - 0.9P = 0.1P. To express this as a percentage of the original price, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (0.1P / P) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we establish the rate of jellyfish creation per hour for a single spring, which is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour. 

Multiplying this rate by the number of springs (5) yields a total of 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour. 

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

72,000"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can utilize algebraic representation. Let's denote Binkie's score as 'B' and Frankie's score as 'F'. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This relationship can be expressed as:

F = 2B + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we can solve for Frankie's score:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we can employ the concept of round-trip travel time. Since James walked halfway to the store and then returned home, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Let's denote the distance to the store as d and the speed as v. The time it took James to walk to the store is given by:

t1 = d / v

Since James walked halfway, the distance to the store is d = 4 miles. The speed is given as v = 4 miles per hour.

t1 = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
t1 = 1 hour

The time it took James to walk back home is the same as the time it took him to walk to the store, as the distance is the same. Therefore, the total time is:

t_total = t1 + t1
t_total = 1 hour + 1 hour
t_total = 2 hours

The total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of purchasing bananas in bunches versus individually, we can employ a cost-benefit analysis. Let's break down the problem into two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Buying bananas individually
Cost per banana = $0.80
Number of bananas purchased = 10
Total cost = 10 * $0.80 = $8.00

Scenario 2: Buying bananas in bunches
Cost per bunch = $3.00
Number of bunches purchased = 10
Total cost = 10 * $3.00 = $30.00

To find the cost savings, we can calculate the difference in total costs between the two scenarios:
Cost savings = Total cost (individual) - Total cost (bunches) = $8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

However, since we're interested in the amount saved, we take the absolute value of the result:
Cost savings = |-$22.00| = $22.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $22.00 by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as x. Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be expressed as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 results in:

x = 20

Therefore, Sam's share of the fence is 20 feet. To find the amount left over for Sam, we subtract his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The amount left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Growth rate = Total growth / Number of years
= 8 inches / 4 years
= 2 inches/year

Now, we can calculate the total growth in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate by the number of years:

Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate * Number of years
= 2 inches/year * 13 years
= 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we can employ a systematic approach by first calculating the number of each type of bike sold and then multiplying that by its respective price.

Let's denote the total number of bikes sold as T, the number of Trekking bikes as Tr, the number of BMX bikes as Bm, and the number of MTB bikes as Mt. We are given the following information:

1. T = 300
2. Tr = 0.5T
3. Bm = 0.15T
4. Mt = T - Tr - Bm

Substituting the given values, we can calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

Tr = 0.5 * 300 = 150
Bm = 0.15 * 300 = 45
Mt = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = Tr * 450 = 150 * 450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = Bm * 250 = 45 * 250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = Mt * 500 = 105 * 500 = $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. 

Let's calculate the net change in bales per hour: 5 (bales produced) - 3 (bales collected) = 2 bales per hour.

Since the farmer and the truck operate for 6 hours, the total change in bales over this period is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we must first calculate the total minutes he spends in class and on extra learning activities.

Given that John attends 5 classes per day, each lasting 40 minutes, we can calculate the total minutes spent in class per week as follows:

Total minutes spent in class per day = 5 classes/day * 40 minutes/class = 200 minutes/day
Total minutes spent in class per week = 200 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1000 minutes/week

Additionally, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday on extra learning activities. To find the total minutes spent on these days, we can calculate:

Total minutes spent on extra learning activities per week = (1/16) * 1000 minutes/week = 62.5 minutes/week

Now, we can find the total minutes spent on learning per week by adding the minutes spent in class and on extra learning activities:

Total minutes spent on learning per week = 1000 minutes/week + 62.5 minutes/week = 1062.5 minutes/week

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60:

Total hours spent on learning per week = 1062.5 minutes/week / 60 = 17.6875 hours/week

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of exponential decay, as the ball's height decreases by a constant factor with each bounce. Given that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height, we can model this situation using the formula:

h_n = h_0 * (2/3)^n

where h_n is the height after the nth bounce, h_0 is the initial height, and n is the number of bounces.

In this case, the initial height (h_0) is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 * 24 = 72 feet. We are interested in the height after the second bounce, so n = 2.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

h_2 = 72 * (2/3)^2
h_2 = 72 * (4/9)
h_2 = 32

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can apply a series of arithmetic operations to the heights of the first three children.

Let's denote the height of the first child as H1, the second child as H2, the third child as H3, and the fourth child as H4. We are given the following information:

H1 = 6 feet = 72 inches
H2 = H1 + 2 inches = 72 + 2 = 74 inches
H3 = H2 - 5 inches = 74 - 5 = 69 inches
H4 = H3 + 3 inches = 69 + 3 = 72 inches

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples in bags of 10, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, the total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 bags * $5
= $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000."
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial amount of meat as 'x'. The Tyrannosaurus rex consumed half of this amount, leaving the remaining half for the velociraptors and the Allosaurus.

The velociraptors then consumed half of the remaining amount, which can be expressed as (1/2)(x/2) = x/4. The Allosaurus consumed 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation:

x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4:

x = 4(270)
x = 1080

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

Final answer: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area to be painted and then divide it by the coverage rate of a single gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons required by dividing the total area by the coverage rate: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of the paint is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon, which is $12. Therefore, the total cost is 12 * $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we can model this scenario using conditional probability. Let's break down the events:

1. Initially, there are 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas.

The number of shaken sodas remains constant at 2, while the total number of sodas decreases to 8. The friend can choose from the remaining 8 sodas.

The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/8. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/8) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. 

Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the speed of the second train as v2 = 0.5v1 = 30 miles per hour. The relative speed (v_rel) is the sum of their speeds:
v_rel = v1 + v2 = 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the distance between the two trains after 3 hours using the formula:
distance = speed * time
distance = v_rel * 3
distance = 90 * 3
distance = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to volunteer and then multiply it by the number of people he can assist per day.

Given that there are 31 days in March, we can calculate the number of days Billy is available to volunteer by subtracting the number of days he takes off from the total number of days in March. Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, we can calculate this as 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we will round down to 6 days.

Now, we can calculate the total number of people Billy can help by multiplying the number of days he is available to volunteer (25) by the number of people he can assist per day (2). This can be represented as:

25 * 2 = 50

Therefore, Billy can help 50 people.

Final answer: 50"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of individuals accommodated by the vehicles and subtracting this from the total number of attendees.

Let's denote the number of buses as B and the number of cars as C. We are given B = 12 and C = 20. Each bus can accommodate 35 people, and each car can accommodate 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people can be represented as:

Total people = (B * 35) + (C * 3)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total people = (12 * 35) + (20 * 3)
= 420 + 60
= 480

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

Given that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can express this relationship as:

M = K - 4

We are also informed that Mike is 24 years old, so we can substitute K = 24 into the equation:

M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Furthermore, it is stated that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

J = M + 10

Substituting the value of M into the equation, we get:

J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the time difference between the two waterslides, we can apply the formula: time = distance / speed. 

For the biggest slide, the time taken is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes. 

For the second biggest slide, the time taken is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

"To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

First, we calculate the total minutes spent on lunch and breaks per day: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time spent on lunch and breaks over 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over 5 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as 'x'. We know that the total distance run by all three individuals is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles. Additionally, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

where A represents the distance run by Amber.

Since we know that Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, we can rewrite the equation as:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

We also know that A = 8, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

8 + 3.5(8) + x = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 28 + x = 52

Combine like terms:

36 + x = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

x = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we must consider the initial charge, the return of the item, and the subsequent purchases.

Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card. She then returned an item worth $15.00, which reduces the outstanding balance to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, she purchased a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00. The discount amount is calculated as 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. Therefore, the discounted price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off its original price of $30.00. The discount amount is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. Consequently, the discounted price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items purchased is the sum of the discounted prices of the frying pan and the towels, which is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Adding this to the reduced balance of $70.00 yields a new balance of $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, which can be represented as (x/5)/3 = x/15. The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means that the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. This can be represented as x/15 = 6.

To solve for x, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Final answer: 90"

1. Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B.

Substituting the value of B from the second equation into the third equation, we get A = 3(2C) = 6C.

Now, substituting the value of C into the equation, we get A = 6(4) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save for a retirement period of 20 years, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Given that Lauren saves 20% of her income, we can calculate her annual savings as follows:

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, her annual expenses will be:

Annual expenses = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

However, this leaves a negative savings amount, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Annual expenses = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is still a negative number. Let's recalculate her annual expenses as a percentage of her income.

Annual expenses as a percentage of income = 0.40 * (1 - 0.20) = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32

Annual expenses = 0.32 * $100,000 = $32,000

Now, we can recalculate her annual savings:

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $32,000 = -$12,000. However, this is still a negative number. Let's recalculate her annual expenses as a percentage of her income.

Annual expenses as a percentage of income = 0.40 * (1 - 0.20) = 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32

Annual expenses = 0.32 * $100,000 = $32,000

Now, we can recalculate her annual savings:

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in the same amount of time, we can establish a proportion to solve for Brian's daily walking distance.

Let's denote Brian's daily walking distance as x miles. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, her daily distance can be represented as 2x miles. 

We know that Sofie walks 10 miles per day, so we can set up the equation 2x = 10 to find Brian's daily walking distance.

Solving for x, we get x = 10 / 2 = 5 miles.

To find the total distance Brian walks in 7 days, we multiply his daily distance by 7: 5 * 7 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."

We can express the total weight of both dogs as the sum of their individual weights: Total Weight = E1 + E2.

Substituting the given expressions for E1 and E2, we get:
Total Weight = (1/4)K + (1/2)K

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 4. We can rewrite (1/2) as (2/4):
Total Weight = (1/4)K + (2/4)K
Total Weight = (3/4)K

Now, we can substitute the given value of K (K = 60 pounds):
Total Weight = (3/4)(60)
Total Weight = 45

Therefore, Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh 45 pounds altogether."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and logical deductions.

Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Luis received x/2 stickers.

It is given that Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the remaining half to Kris. Therefore, Kris received x/4 stickers.

We are also given that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. This implies that Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received x/4 stickers, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 16.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, yielding x = 64.

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's in the 3 large bags and then divide it by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Given that each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, the total number of M&M's in the 3 large bags can be calculated as follows:

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Since each small bag contains 10 M&M's, the number of small bags can be found by dividing the total number of M&M's by 10:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can employ the concept of circumference and division.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we calculate half of the earth's circumference:

Distance = (1/2) × Circumference
= (1/2) × 40,000 km
= 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance:

Number of days = Distance / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the speed of the faster car, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C.

Given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can express this relationship as:

B = 5A

We are also given that the average car can go 120 mph, so A = 120. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

B = 5(120)
B = 600

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

C = 1.25B

Substituting the value of B, we get:

C = 1.25(600)
C = 750

Thus, the speed of the faster car is 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'x - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We can express this relationship as:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago
14 = 2(x - 2)

Now, we can solve for 'x' by distributing the 2 on the right-hand side:

14 = 2x - 4

Next, we add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with 'x':

14 + 4 = 2x - 4 + 4
18 = 2x

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18/2
x = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. We can rewrite the first equation as M = A. Substituting this into the third equation, we get C = A + 12.

Now, we can substitute C = A + 12 into the second equation: (A + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get A + S + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we obtain A + S = 18.

Since A = M, we can rewrite this equation as A + S = 18 becomes A + A = 18, which simplifies to 2A = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 9.

Now that we know A = 9, we can find the value of C. Substituting A = 9 into the equation C = A + 12, we get C = 9 + 12 = 21.

To find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted, we can calculate C - A = 21 - 9 = 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds by dividing by 16:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Finally, we can find the total weight of the crayons and boxes by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds.

Final answer: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total revenue John can generate from selling the planks, we need to calculate the total number of planks and then multiply it by the price per plank.

First, we calculate the total number of logs John can produce from the tree. Given that the tree is 80 feet long and he cuts it into 4-foot logs, we can calculate the number of logs as follows:

Number of logs = Total length of tree / Length of each log
= 80 feet / 4 feet
= 20 logs

Since each log can be cut into 5 planks, we can calculate the total number of planks as:

Total number of planks = Number of logs * Number of planks per log
= 20 logs * 5 planks/log
= 100 planks

Now, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of planks by the price per plank:

Total revenue = Total number of planks * Price per plank
= 100 planks * $1.2/plank
= $120

Therefore, John can generate a total revenue of $120 from selling the planks.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can employ basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote Valerie's monthly salary as V, her brother's monthly salary as B, and their mother's monthly salary as M. We are given that V = 1/2 * B and M = 2 * (V + B).

First, we can express B in terms of V: B = 2 * V = 2 * 5000 = $10,000.

Next, we can substitute B into the equation for M: M = 2 * (V + B) = 2 * (5000 + 10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money they all have together: Total = V + B + M = $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we can break down her walk into two segments: the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as $v_b$ and the speed on the sidewalk as $v_s$. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, we have $v_s = 2v_b$.

We know that the time spent walking on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula $t = \frac{d}{v}$, we can find the speed at which she walks on the beach:

$v_b = \frac{d_{beach}}{t_{beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles/minute}$

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

$t_{sidewalk} = \frac{d_{sidewalk}}{v_s} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v_b} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{20} \text{ minutes/mile} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ minutes}$

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

$t_{total} = t_{beach} + t_{sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{40} \text{ minutes} = \frac{1600}{40} \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{40} \text{ minutes} = \frac{1601}{40} \text{ minutes}$

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is $\frac{1601}{40}$ minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1601}{40}}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks required for Jane to accumulate a total savings of $60, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the concept of linear accumulation.

Given that Jane saves $4 per week, we can model her savings as a linear function of time. Let's denote the number of weeks as 't'. The total savings after 't' weeks can be represented as:

Total Savings = Initial Savings + (Weekly Savings * Number of Weeks)
= $32 + $4t

We want to find the value of 't' when the total savings reaches $60. Setting up the equation:

$60 = $32 + $4t

Subtracting $32 from both sides:

$28 = $4t

Dividing both sides by $4:

t = $28 / $4
t = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to accumulate a total savings of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ a straightforward additive approach. We have three distinct scenarios to consider:

1. Three trees, each containing 7 blue birds, contribute a total of 3 × 7 = 21 blue birds.
2. Two trees, each having 4 blue birds, contribute a total of 2 × 4 = 8 blue birds.
3. One tree, with 3 blue birds, adds 3 to the total count.

By summing up the contributions from each scenario, we obtain the overall total: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 blue birds.

The total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob possesses, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial number of marbles as x. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. This can be expressed as:

x + 24 = 60

Solving for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Therefore, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

If Bob loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he has left can be calculated by subtracting 10 from the initial amount:

36 - 10 = 26

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. We can set up the following equation:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

4 * 33 + x = 5 * 40

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

Final answer: 68"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

The number of cows added per day is 20, and the number of chickens added per day is 10. Therefore, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows, and the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

The initial number of cows is 50, and the initial number of chickens is 20. Adding these to the total number of cows and chickens added, we get:

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is the sum of the total number of cows and chickens, which is 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each bagel after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease to the original cost of the bagels. 

First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels: 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Next, we calculate the discount amount: 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels in a pack (9) to find the cost of each bagel: $36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

Therefore, the cost of each bagel after the discount is $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, leveraging our understanding of algebraic relationships and mathematical operations.

Let's denote the number of scoops as 's' and the number of potatoes as 'p'. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes, which can be expressed as:

s = 23 - 5
s = 18

We are also given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

p = 6 - 3
p = 3

Furthermore, we know that 3 scoops require 3 potatoes. Therefore, we can establish a proportion to find the number of potatoes required for 1 scoop:

p/s = 3/1
p = 3s

Now, we can substitute the value of 's' into the equation to find the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops:

p = 3(18)
p = 54

However, we are asked to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate, which is 5 scoops less than 23 scoops. To find this, we can subtract 5 from the total number of potatoes required for 23 scoops:

p = 54 - 5
p = 49

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of eggs consumed in the two distinct periods.

Let's break down the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days. 

In the first 30 days, Chester's egg consumption can be calculated as 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

In the subsequent 30 days, his consumption increases to 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period is the sum of these two values: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To express this in dozens, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12, as 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, the total number of dozens of eggs is 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R. We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can set up the equation:

B + G + R = 60

Substituting R = 2G and G = 17, we get:

B + 17 + 2(17) = 60

Simplifying the equation:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that Tim grows 5 trees, each yielding 6 lemons annually, we can calculate the total lemons collected over a decade as follows:

Number of trees: 5
Number of lemons per tree per year: 6
Number of years in a decade: 10

Total lemons per year: 5 * 6 = 30
Total lemons in a decade: 30 * 10 = 300

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and we are asked to find the number of women who remained after 20 women alighted from the bus.

First, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio by adding the number of men and women: 5 + 9 = 14.

Next, we can divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we can multiply 9 by the value of one part to find the initial number of women: 9 × 6 = 54.

Now, we can subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus to find the number of women who remained: 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by calculating the number of bouquets sold. Given that Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day and he sold it for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold can be calculated as:

Total bouquets sold = Total earnings from bouquets / Earnings per bouquet
Total bouquets sold = $56 / $8
Total bouquets sold = 7

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold can be calculated as:

Total sunflowers sold = Total bouquets sold * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
Total sunflowers sold = 7 * 12
Total sunflowers sold = 84

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 84 sunflowers after 3 days.

"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost and the total revenue.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. However, this scenario is impossible, as the revenue cannot exceed the cost.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we can apply the concept of linear programming. Let's define the variables:

- L = number of large-sized picture scenes
- M = number of medium-sized picture scenes
- S = number of small-sized picture scenes
- d = number of days

We are given the following constraints:
- L = 45
- M = 36
- S = 49
- L = 5d
- M = 6d
- S = 7d

We can rewrite the constraints as:
- 5d ≥ 45
- 6d ≥ 36
- 7d ≥ 49

Simplifying the inequalities, we get:
- d ≥ 9
- d ≥ 6
- d ≥ 7

Since the smallest value of d that satisfies all the constraints is 9, we can conclude that the minimum number of days required to complete the project is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we can employ the concept of division. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we can express this as a mathematical expression: 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) to find the number of eggs each child receives. This can be represented as:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Therefore, each child will receive 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of days in May (31) by the daily cost per fish.

Total cost = Number of days in May * Daily cost per fish
Total cost = 31 * $1
Total cost = $31

Therefore, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic operation. We start with the initial number of roses, subtract the number she gave to her mother, and then add the number she purchased.

Let's denote the initial number of roses as I, the number given to her mother as G, and the number purchased as P. We are given I = 30, G = 24, and P = 15.

The total number of roses now (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = I - G + P

Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 30 - 24 + 15
T = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine Sid's average speed, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this scenario, the total distance traveled is the sum of the initial 110 miles and the additional 140 miles, resulting in a total distance of 250 miles. The total time taken is the sum of the initial 2 hours and the additional 3 hours, yielding a total time of 5 hours.

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"In probability theory, we can model the scenario using the concept of independent events. Let's denote the probability of the first ticket winning as P(A) = 0.2 and the probability of the second ticket winning as P(B) = 0.6, since it is three times more likely to win.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we can use the formula for the probability of independent events:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A ∩ B) = 0.2 * 0.6
P(A ∩ B) = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(A ∩ B) = 0.12 * 100
P(A ∩ B) = 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and Y, respectively.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be expressed as:

J = C + 5

We are also given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This can be expressed as:

C = 2Y

Since the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person, we can set up the equation:

C + J + Y = 81

Substituting the expressions for C and J in terms of Y, we get:

2Y + (2Y + 5) + Y = 81

Combine like terms:

5Y + 5 = 81

Subtract 5 from both sides:

5Y = 76

Divide both sides by 5:

Y = 15.2

Now that we have found Y, we can find C and J:

C = 2Y = 2(15.2) = 30.4

J = C + 5 = 30.4 + 5 = 35.4

Since the total number of seashells is 81, we can verify that the sum of C, J, and Y is indeed 81:

30.4 + 35.4 + 15.2 = 81

Now, to find out how many seashells each person got when they divided them equally, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3:

81 ÷ 3 = 27

The final answer is: 27"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, and he consumes 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots on weekdays is given by:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on the weekend. There are 2 weekend days, and he consumes 5 carrots each day, resulting in:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend to obtain the overall weekly consumption:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the length of the second song, which is 60% longer than the first song. This can be expressed as:

Length of the second song = Length of the first song + (60% of Length of the first song)
= 5 + (0.6 * 5)
= 5 + 3
= 8 minutes

Now, we can find the total time of the cassette by adding the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 + 8
= 13 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the profit earned by Linus, we can employ the principles of basic accounting and algebra. 

First, we need to determine the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices. The cost of each device is $20, and Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (2 * $20) + (4 * $20)
Total Cost = $40 + $80
Total Cost = $120

Next, we need to calculate the total selling price. Linus sells each device for twice the original price, which is 2 * $20 = $40. Since he sold 6 devices in total, the total selling price can be calculated as:

Total Selling Price = 6 * $40
Total Selling Price = $240

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

Therefore, Linus earned a profit of $120.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can utilize the given information to establish a linear relationship between the heights of the individuals involved. 

Let's denote Carl's height as C, Ned's height as N, and Isabel's height as I. We are given the following relationships:

1. I = 7 feet
2. N = I - 2 feet
3. C = N + 1 foot

Substituting the expression for N from equation (2) into equation (3), we get:

C = (I - 2) + 1
C = I - 1

Now, we can substitute the value of I into the expression for C:

C = 7 - 1
C = 6 feet

Therefore, Carl's cane is 6 feet long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people and then divide it by the energy demand per bottle.

Energy demand per bottle = 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand
Energy demand per bottle = 0.2

Total energy demand of 2300 people = 2300 * 0.2
Total energy demand of 2300 people = 460

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Total number of bottles needed = Total energy demand of 2300 people / Energy demand per bottle
Total number of bottles needed = 460 / 0.2

Since we can't produce a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of days = 1

Now, we can calculate the number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day to meet the demand.

Number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day = Total number of bottles needed / Number of days
Number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day = 2300 / 1
Number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day = 2300

However, since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, they need to produce fewer bottles per day to meet the demand.

Additional bottles per day = Number of bottles Hortex needs to produce per day - Number of bottles Hortex can produce per day
Additional bottles per day = 2300 - 4200
Additional bottles per day = -1900

Since we can't produce a negative number of bottles, we need to recalculate the number of bottles needed per day to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

Number of bottles needed per day = Total number of bottles needed / Number of days

"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the total number of babies as 8. We know that 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, which translates to 6 purple-wearing babies. Additionally, 1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, and 1/3 of the blue-wearing babies also wear bows.

The number of purple-wearing babies who also wear bows is 1/3 * 6 = 2. The number of blue-wearing babies who also wear bows is 1/3 * 2 = 2/3.

The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the purple-wearing babies who wear bows and the blue-wearing babies who wear bows: 2 + 2/3 = 8/3.

Now, we can calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 2 / (8/3)
= 2 * 3 / 8
= 6 / 8
= 3 / 4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%.

The final answer is 75%."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of reports received on Wednesday as 'x'. We are given that the total number of reports received is 5168, with 1907 reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 reports received on Thursday and Friday.

We can set up the following equation:

x + 1907 + 2136 = 5168

Combine like terms:

x + 4043 = 5168

Subtract 4043 from both sides:

x = 5168 - 4043

x = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the total area of land sold and then multiply it by the selling price per square meter.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is equivalent to 40 square meters. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, which is 20 square meters. The remaining land is 80 - (40 + 20) = 20 square meters.

The total area of land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. The selling price per square meter is $3. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling the land is 60 * 3 = $180.

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine Geb's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G. According to the problem, G = (1/2)H - 10.

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate his daily face mask usage as follows:

Daily face mask usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times he goes out per day
= 2 face masks/day * 3 times/day
= 6 face masks/day

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we can multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks/day * 2 days
= 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we can employ a systematic approach to account for the eggs found by each individual.

Let's denote the total number of eggs hidden as 'T', the number of eggs found by Lamar as 'L', the number of eggs found by Stacy as 'S', the number of eggs found by Charlie as 'C', and the number of eggs found by Mei as 'M'. We are given the following information:

1. T = 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs
2. L = 5 eggs
3. S = 2L = 2 × 5 = 10 eggs
4. C = S - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 eggs
5. M = C/2 = 8/2 = 4 eggs

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by all individuals: L + S + C + M = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs initially hidden: T - (L + S + C + M) = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of apartments in the last complex. Given that it is 60% larger than the combined total of the first two complexes, we can express this as:

Total apartments in the last complex = 200 + 200 + 0.6(200 + 200)
= 200 + 200 + 0.6(400)
= 200 + 240
= 440 apartments

Now, we can calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from:

Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 440
= 840 apartments

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is:

Total collections per week = 840 * 3
= 2520

Finally, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying the total collections per week by the payment per collection:

Weekly earnings = 2520 * $0.40
= $1008

The final answer is: $1008"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we can analyze the given information and apply mathematical operations.

The problem states that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We can represent the initial amount of fruits as 'x'. 

Using this information, we can set up the following equations:

Year 1: x = 50
Year 2: 3x = 150
Year 3: 7x = 350
Year 4: 7x = 1050
Year 5: 7x = 2450
Year 6: 7x = 7350
Year 7: 7x = 17150
Year 8: 10x - 200 = 17100
Year 9: 0
Year 10: 20x = 1000

We can solve for 'x' by using the equation from Year 1: x = 50.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

Therefore, the total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we can calculate the amount she gave him as:

(1/5) × $100 = $20

Now, we add this amount to Jack's initial $100:

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

Final Answer: The final answer is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be expressed as:

B = Y - 7

Additionally, the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write:

R = 4B

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which gives us the equation:

Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation, we have:

6Y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides yields:

6Y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

Y = 12

Now that we have found the length of the yellow rope, we can determine the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can calculate the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as x. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, her initial amount is 3x.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This can be expressed as:

3x - x = (4/5) * 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = (12/5)x

Multiplying both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction, we have:

10x = 12x

Subtracting 10x from both sides yields:

0 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 0

This implies that Ronnie was not given any money, as x represents the amount Ronnie was given. Therefore, Ronnie's initial amount of $5 remains unchanged.

The final answer is: $5"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of each color paint as 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow, we can express the total amount of paint used as:

x + x + x + x + x = 12

This equation simplifies to 4x = 12.

Solving for x, we get:

4x = 12
x = 12/4
x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. The house consists of four bedrooms, each measuring 20 feet by 12 feet. The living room is 5 times larger than one bedroom, and the remaining space in the house is 1000 square feet.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom: 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet. Since there are four bedrooms, their combined area is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the living room, which is 5 times the area of one bedroom: 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The total area of the bedrooms and living room is 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, we add the area of the remaining space in the house, which is given as 1000 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the house is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

The total area of the house is 3160 square feet.

Final answer: 3160"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted across the five days, we can utilize the concept of a geometric progression. The number of clouds on each day is doubling from the previous day, which indicates a common ratio of 2. The initial term (a) is 3, and the number of terms (n) is 5.

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

Substituting the given values, we get:

S_5 = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S_5 = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S_5 = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S_5 = 3 * 31
S_5 = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12, so the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12. 

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 120 pods. The cost of the new box remains the same, $12. 

To find the cost per pod of the new box, we can divide the cost by the number of pods: $12 / 120 = $0.10 per pod.

Now, we can calculate the number of cycles that can be run for $1 by dividing $1 by the cost per pod: $1 / $0.10 = 10 cycles.

Therefore, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40 bills. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he is left with 20 bills. Finally, he triples his money, resulting in 60 bills. 

To convert these bills to 5-dollar bills, we can calculate the total amount of money Thomas has after tripling his money: 60 bills * $20 = $1200. Since each 5-dollar bill represents $5, we can divide the total amount by 5 to find the number of 5-dollar bills: $1200 / 5 = 240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. This can be expressed as:

Goals scored by team A in the first half = 4
Goals scored by team B in the first half = 4 - 2 = 2

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
Total goals = 4.5 + 10 = 14.5

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 14.5."
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can model the situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as t.

Initially, the teacher has 5 inches of chalk, so L = 5. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which can be represented as 0.20L. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45L. Since he recycled the chalk when it reached 2.25 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.45L = 2.25

Solving for L, we get:

L = 2.25 / 0.45
L = 5

This confirms that the initial length of the chalk is indeed 5 inches.

Now, we can model the remaining chalk using the equation:

L - 0.45L = 0.55L

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the remaining chalk will decrease by 20% each day. We can represent this as:

0.80(0.55L) = 0.44L

This equation shows that the remaining chalk decreases by 44% each day.

To find the number of days it takes for the teacher to use up the remaining chalk, we can divide the remaining chalk by the daily decrease:

t = L / 0.44L
t = 1 / 0.44
t ≈ 2.27

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk after approximately 3 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of students and subtracting the number of students on varsity.

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of girls as G, and the number of boys as B. We are given that G = 12 and B = 12.

The number of girls on varsity can be calculated as (1/3)G, and the number of boys on varsity can be calculated as (1/4)B.

Total number of students on varsity = (1/3)G + (1/4)B
= (1/3)(12) + (1/4)(12)
= 4 + 3
= 7

Total number of students in the class = G + B
= 12 + 12
= 24

Number of students not on varsity = Total number of students - Total number of students on varsity
= 24 - 7
= 17

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as 'm'. According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which can be expressed as 3m + 2.

Given that Mike bought 5 face masks, we can substitute m = 5 into the equation: 3(5) + 2.

First, we calculate 3 times 5, which equals 15. Then, we add 2 to the result, yielding 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

17"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the ratio of the total number of teeth fixed to the total number of teeth and then express it as a percentage.

The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 11 teeth (since 7 more than the number drilled). Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is 4 + 11 = 15.

The total number of teeth James has is 30.

The ratio of the total number of teeth fixed to the total number of teeth is 15/30, which can be simplified to 1/2.

To express this ratio as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus returned. Since he returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk, we can calculate the refund amount as follows:

Refund Amount = (2/5) * 4000 * $3.5

First, we can simplify the fraction 2/5 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This leaves us with 2/5.

Refund Amount = (2/5) * 4000 * $3.5
= (2/5) * 4000 * 3.5
= (2 * 4000 * 3.5) / 5
= (8000 * 3.5) / 5
= 28000 / 5
= $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent Wendy's and Colin's ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

We can also represent the second statement as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the second equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books Bob can purchase with his budget of $27,000. 

The cost of one set of 100 books is $500. To find the total number of sets, we can divide the total budget by the cost of one set:

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by the number of schools to find the number of sets each school will receive:

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

As each set contains 100 books, we can calculate the total number of books per school by multiplying the number of sets per school by 100:

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can purchase 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"This problem can be approached using a simple iterative process. Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, Newton has 2 apples. 

1. He picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This results in a total of 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples. He then puts all but 1 apple in his pocket, leaving him with 7 - 1 = 6 apples. He throws 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out, bringing the total to 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brings home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The cost of the coal is directly proportional to the number of 50 kg bags, and each bag costs $18. 

The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Number of Bags * Cost per Bag
= (Total Weight of Coal / Weight per Bag) * Cost per Bag
= (850 kg / 50 kg) * $18
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of slices required and then dividing that by the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices consumed by Kate's friends. Each friend consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, resulting in a total of 10 slices per friend. With 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Next, we need to determine the total number of slices per pizza. Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices per pizza is 12 + 8 = 20 slices.

Now, we can calculate the number of pizzas needed by dividing the total number of slices consumed (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to purchase 3 pizzas to satisfy the demand.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can utilize the principle of additive combinatorics. We have two distinct sets of miles: one for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and another for Tuesday and Thursday.

Let's denote the miles run on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as M, and the miles run on Tuesday and Thursday as T. We are given that M = 3 miles and T = 5 miles. The total miles run this week can be calculated as the sum of these two sets:

Total miles = M + T

"To determine the time required for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we can model the situation using a differential equation. Let's denote the number of snowballs Jay builds per hour as 'b' and the number of snowballs that melt per hour as 'm'. We are given that b = 20 and m = 2 * (1/4) = 0.5 (since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, and there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour).

The rate of change of the total number of snowballs (S) with respect to time (t) can be represented by the differential equation:

dS/dt = b - m

We want to find the time required for S to reach 60. We can rewrite the differential equation as:

dS/dt = 20 - 0.5

To solve this differential equation, we can integrate both sides with respect to time:

∫(dS) = ∫(20 - 0.5)dt

S = 20t - 0.5t + C

where C is the constant of integration.

We know that S(0) = 0 (initially, there are no snowballs), so we can solve for C:

0 = 20(0) - 0.5(0) + C
C = 0

Now, we can write the equation for S:

S = 20t - 0.5t
S = 19.5t

We want to find the time required for S to reach 60. We can set up the equation:

60 = 19.5t

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 60 / 19.5
t ≈ 3.08 hours

Therefore, it will take approximately 3.08 hours for Jay to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.08}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can utilize the given information that John is twice as old as Jim. This can be represented by the equation:

J = J/2

where J represents Jim's age. Given that John's current age is 28, we can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = J/2

To solve for J, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

J = 28 × 2
J = 56

Therefore, Jim's age is 56.

The final answer is 56."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate one more slice than Doxa, the number of slices her sister ate is x + 1. Similarly, her brother ate one more slice than her sister, so the number of slices her brother ate is (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten can be represented as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

3x + 3

Since Doxa ate 1 slice, we can substitute x = 1 into the expression:

3(1) + 3 = 6

The total number of slices eaten is 6."
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

We are given that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 78

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

x = 63

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and add it to the cost of the color. 

The cost of the haircut is calculated as the difference in length of her hair, which is 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches. Since the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is given as $40. Therefore, the total cost of the haircut and color is $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the number of hours worked per week by the number of weeks in April, and then multiplying the result by her hourly rate. Additionally, we must account for her daily attendance bonus.

First, we calculate the total hours worked in April: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours.

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10 per day, which amounts to $10 * 6 days = $60.

Therefore, her total earnings for April can be calculated as: $270 (hourly earnings) + $60 (attendance bonus) = $330.

The final answer is: $330"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we can apply the principle of linear summation. Let's break down the earnings from each task:

- Earning from emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
- Earning from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Earning from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
- Earning from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

Therefore, Jason's total earnings for the two-week period are $8.00."
"To calculate the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we can utilize the concept of scalar multiplication. Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1 (shark:whale). 

We can then multiply the amount of blood a whale has by the ratio to find the amount of blood a shark has: 40 * 3 = 120 gallons. 

To find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we can multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct phases and calculate the cumulative total.

Let's denote the initial number of people as P1, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as P2, and the number of people who entered by evening as P3.

Given:
P1 = 50 (initial number of people)
P2 = 40 (number of people who entered at 10:00)
P3 = 3 * P1 (number of people who entered by evening)

We can calculate P3 as follows:
P3 = 3 * P1
P3 = 3 * 50
P3 = 150

Now, we can calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant by adding the initial number, the number who entered at 10:00, and the number who entered by evening:
Total = P1 + P2 + P3
Total = 50 + 40 + 150
Total = 240

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 240."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens, which is twice the amount of red pens: 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

Finally, we sum the number of red and black pens to obtain the total: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of the scotch and cognac, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the cost of the scotch. Given that John purchases 10 bottles for a total of $600, we can express this as:

Cost of scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60 per bottle

Next, we need to find the cost of the cognac. Since it costs 50% more than the scotch, we can calculate the cognac's cost per bottle by multiplying the scotch's cost by 1.5:

Cost of cognac per bottle = $60 × 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Now, we can determine the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles purchased:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles × Cost of cognac per bottle
= 2 × $90
= $180

Finally, we can find the total cost of everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac:

Total cost = Cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $180
= $780

The final answer is: $780"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as W1 and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day as P1. We are given that W1 = 20. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day, we can express P1 as 2W1, which equals 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, the number of White Oak trees planted is W2 = W1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is P2 = P1 + (1/4)P1 = 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is W1 + P1 = 20 + 40 = 60. The total number of trees planted on the second day is W2 + P2 = 30 + 50 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we can analyze the sequence of events that led to the reduction in the initial 24 gallons.

Initially, 4 gallons were consumed on the first day, resulting in 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, leading to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, resulting in 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remaining.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

To find the amount available for each person, we can divide the remaining 5 gallons by the number of people (3) at the party.

5 gallons ÷ 3 people = 5/3 gallons per person

To express this as a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To solve this linear equation, we can employ algebraic techniques to isolate the variable x, representing the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

The given equation is 4x + 8 = 40. To isolate x, we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation, yielding 4x = 32.

Next, we divide both sides by 4, resulting in x = 8.

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes, which is one-third of the total fish population. This can be represented as:

Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * Total fish population
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Next, we find the remaining fish by subtracting the number of fish with red stripes from the total fish population:

Remaining fish = Total fish population - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Now, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes, which is 5/11 of the remaining fish:

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
= (5/11) * 44
= 20

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to obtain the total:

Total fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the initial number of colors from both the palettes and the makeup sets.

Initially, Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, the total number of colors Amy had initially was 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

However, her sister stole one palette containing 4 colors, reducing the total number of colors to 26 - 4 = 22 colors. 

Next, Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Since half of 6 is 3, she used up 3 colors, leaving her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we need to establish the height of the first floor, which is given as 7 times Mattison's height. Given Mattison's height is 60 inches, the height of the first floor can be calculated as:

Height of the first floor = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches

Next, we are told that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison's height. This implies that the height of the first floor is three times Mattison's height, which aligns with our initial calculation. 

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor. The height of the second floor is given as three times Mattison's height, which is:

Height of the second floor = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor can be calculated as:

Height of the roof from the second floor = Height of the first floor - Height of the second floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total number of shells. This can be expressed as:

Number of shells found by Alphas = 0.4 * 700

Using the formula for percentage calculation, we can simplify this expression:

Number of shells found by Alphas = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Next, we need to find the remaining number of shells after team Alphas has collected their share. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells:

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Now, we are given that team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We can express this as:

Number of shells found by The finders = 0.6 * 420

Using the formula for percentage calculation, we can simplify this expression:

Number of shells found by The finders = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Finally, to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we subtract the number of shells found by The finders from the remaining shells:

Number of shells found by Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the walking distance required for the last dog, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Given that the first three dogs require 1, 4, and 3 miles of walking, respectively, we can calculate the total walking distance for these three dogs as:

Total walking distance for the first three dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Since the average walking distance for all four dogs is 3 miles, we can set up the following equation:

(8 + x) / 4 = 3

where x represents the walking distance for the last dog.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

8 + x = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides yields:

x = 4

Therefore, the last dog requires 4 miles of walking per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be expressed as 0.4 * $250,000. 

The result of this calculation is $100,000. Next, we need to find 60% of this loan amount, which represents the amount used to pay off debts. This can be calculated as 0.6 * $100,000.

The result of this calculation is $60,000. To find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount: $100,000 - $60,000.

The final calculation yields $40,000.

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas caught and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas caught is the sum of the weights of the individual tunas: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate Deandre's total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram:

Total Earnings = Total Weight * Cost per Kilogram
Total Earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total Earnings = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we can apply the formula for calculating profit, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

Given that Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Selling Price = (11/8) * Cost Price

We are given that the cost price is $72. Substituting this value into the expression, we get:

Selling Price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
= 99 - 72
= 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we can calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and sum them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 2 * 3 = 6 liters. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is the sum of the water removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that there are 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is calculated as follows:

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Since 12 balloons are left, the number of balloons thrown can be found by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we must first calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose. 

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x. According to the problem, the amount of the second medicine is 3 times that of the first, so it can be represented as 3x. 

We are given that the amount of the first medicine is 14 mL, so x = 14. Therefore, the amount of the second medicine is 3x = 3(14) = 42 mL.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amounts of both medicines: x + 3x = 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we can break down the problem into two parts: the monthly payments and the remaining balance.

First, we calculate the total amount paid in 11 months, which is a straightforward calculation:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
= $275

Next, we calculate the interest on the initial amount borrowed. The interest is 2% of the initial amount, which is $300.

Interest = 0.02 * $300
= $6

Now, we add the interest to the initial amount to find the total amount owed before the final payment.

Total amount owed before the final payment = Initial amount + Interest
= $300 + $6
= $306

The final payment is the difference between the total amount owed and the total amount paid in 11 months.

Final payment = Total amount owed - Total amount paid in 11 months
= $306 - $275
= $31

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that there are 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes, the total number of diaper changes can be calculated as follows:

Total diaper changes = Number of children * Diaper changes per child
Total diaper changes = 2 * 5
Total diaper changes = 10

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can calculate the number of diapers Jordan changes by dividing the total number of diaper changes by 2:

Number of diapers Jordan changes = Total diaper changes / 2
Number of diapers Jordan changes = 10 / 2
Number of diapers Jordan changes = 5

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the total volume of the container. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

V = 6 * 6 * 15
V = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by this value to account for the packing efficiency:

Total number of jelly beans = V / 0.8
Total number of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8
Total number of jelly beans = 675

Next, we need to calculate the number of red jelly beans, which is 30% of the total number of jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 * Total number of jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 0.3 * 675
Number of red jelly beans = 202.5

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number:

Difference = True number of red jelly beans - Estimated number of red jelly beans
Difference = 900 - 202.5
Difference = 697.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{697.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This equates to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing passengers, the total becomes 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in a total of 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.

Given the bus's capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces can be calculated as 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: the initial 5 years and the subsequent 3 years.

During the initial 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, resulting in a new cost of $5 per visit. Given that Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, the total annual expenditure for this period can be calculated as:

3 visits/year × $5/visit = $15/year

Multiplying this by the number of years, we get:

$15/year × 5 years = $75

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit remained at $5, and Pauline continued to visit 3 times a year. The total annual expenditure for this period can be calculated as:

3 visits/year × $5/visit = $15/year

Multiplying this by the number of years, we get:

$15/year × 3 years = $45

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is the sum of the expenditures for both periods:

$75 + $45 = $120

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $120 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we can employ a simple division-based approach. Given that 8 students can participate in the escape room at a time, and there are 30 students in total (10 students per grade * 3 grades), we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
= 30 students / 8 students per group
= 3.75 groups

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. To find the total time required, we can multiply the number of full groups by the time required per group (45 minutes) and add the time required for the partial group:

Time for 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes
Time for the partial group = 2 students * 45 minutes/student = 90 minutes (since the partial group will take the full 45 minutes to escape)

Total time required = Time for 3 full groups + Time for the partial group
= 135 minutes + 90 minutes
= 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can calculate the cost of the items separately and then sum them.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated using the formula for the cost of multiple items: Cost = Quantity x Price per item. Therefore, the total cost of the tables is 4 x $20 = $80.

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated using the same formula: Cost = Quantity x Price per item. Hence, the total cost of the roof frames is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of the costs of the tables and the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we obtain:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece, we can calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef and he aims to produce 80 meatballs, we can first calculate the total pounds of meat needed.

Let's denote the number of pounds of meat as 'x'. Since Aiden obtains 16 meatballs per pound, the total number of meatballs can be represented as 16x. We are given that he wants to make 80 meatballs, so we can set up the equation:

16x = 80

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 16:

x = 80 / 16
x = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, the total amount of seasoning needed is:

2 tablespoons/pound * 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each window is 35 inches wide and there are five windows, the total width of the windows can be calculated as follows:

Total width = Number of windows × Width of each window
Total width = 5 × 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke requires fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the total fabric needed as follows:

Total fabric needed = 2 × Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 × 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should purchase 350 inches of fabric to meet his requirements.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we can employ a piecewise approach, considering the two distinct pricing tiers: $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes and $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes.

Let's calculate the cost for each segment:

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is given by:
C1 = 16 * $0.25 = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is given by:
C2 = 20 * $0.20 = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
C_total = C1 + C2 = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. Let's denote the amount of rain on Monday as M and the amount of rain on Tuesday as T. According to the problem, M = 2 inches.

The problem states that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. This can be expressed as T = 2M + 1.

Substituting the value of M into the equation, we get T = 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x and the number of brownies as y.

We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as y = 3x - 2.

Additionally, we know that each person receives two treats, and there are five people in the class, resulting in a total of 10 treats. This can be represented by the equation x + y = 10.

Substituting the expression for y from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we have:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides yields:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4 results in:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we can break down the problem into its components. 

First, we calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure. The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. Therefore, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, we calculate the cost of the nail art. Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Finally, we add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of nail art to find the total cost. The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in total.

Final answer: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of issues from the three magazines that send 12 issues each. This can be represented as 3 * 12, which equals 36. 

Next, we consider the magazine that sends 6 issues per year. This value remains unchanged at 6.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which can be calculated as 4 * 6, resulting in 24 issues per year.

Now, we add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can express Shelley's painting count as x + 8.

Given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can represent Samantha's painting count as (x + 8) - 12.

We are informed that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we obtain:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the final price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December: $40 + 80% of $40 = $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the earnings from each type of lesson and then summing them.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. This can be represented as:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, which can be expressed as:

$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - 0.25 * $80 = $80 - $20 = $60

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the 2 one-hour lessons with the reduced rate:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To calculate the mean score, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, the sum of the scores is 630, and there are 9 scores.

Mean = (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

Therefore, the mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate, which is 2/5 of the total number of apples. This can be calculated as:

(2/5) × 60 = (2 × 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

The remaining number of apples is then 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Next, we need to find 25% of the remaining apples, which is given by:

(25/100) × 36 = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples

The remaining number of apples after giving some to his sister is 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Since Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each, the total amount of money he received can be calculated as:

27 apples × $3/apple = $81

Therefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote last year (9) equate to the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total number of novels.

Let x represent the total number of novels written this year. The proportion can be set up as follows:

3/4 = 9/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 9 * 4
3x = 36

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 36/3
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Given that Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr and he traveled for 3 days, we can calculate the total distance covered as follows:

Total time taken = 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours

Total distance covered = Average speed * Total time taken
Total distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Total distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can employ a step-by-step approach, leveraging the information provided.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as x. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5x. The total grapes used by the siblings is 6 + 5x.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. The total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - (6 + 5x) = 48. This equation accounts for the grapes used by the siblings and the mother.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 5x - 6 = 48, which further simplifies to -4x - 6 = 48.

Adding 6 to both sides of the equation yields -4x = 54.

Dividing both sides by -4, we obtain x = -54/4, which simplifies to x = -13.5.

However, the number of grapes cannot be negative, so we must re-examine our approach. Let's re-evaluate the equation: x - (6 + 5x) = 48.

This can be rewritten as x - 5x - 6 = 48, which simplifies to -4x - 6 = 48.

Adding 6 to both sides yields -4x = 54.

Dividing both sides by -4, we get x = -54/4, which simplifies to x = -13.5.

Since the number of grapes cannot be negative, we must consider an alternative approach. Let's re-examine the equation: x - (6 + 5x) = 48.

This can be rewritten as x - 5x - 6 = 48, which simplifies to -4x - 6 = 48.

Adding 6 to both sides yields -4x = 54.

Dividing both sides by -4, we get x = -54/4, which simplifies to x = -13.5.

However, this solution is incorrect due to the negative value. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know that the mother used 48 grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. This means the mother had 48 grapes initially. Since the siblings used 6 + 5x grapes, we can set up the equation: 48 = 6 + 5x.

Subtracting 6 from both sides yields 42 = 5x.

Dividing both sides by 5, we obtain x = 42/5, which simplifies to x = 8.4.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes was 8.4 * 5 = 42.

Final answer: 42"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School on the given day, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle allows us to calculate the total number of teachers by adding the number of sick teachers and the number of substitute teachers, while accounting for any potential overlap.

Let's denote the total number of teachers as T, the number of sick teachers as S, and the number of substitute teachers as St. We are given S = 13 and St = 9. Since there is no information suggesting any overlap between the two groups, we can directly add the number of sick teachers and substitute teachers to find the total number of teachers.

T = S + St
T = 13 + 9
T = 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total annual expenditure on making macaroni and cheese, we must consider the cost of the ingredients. The cost of pasta is a constant $1.00 per box, while the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week, and the cost of gruyere cheese is twice that amount, resulting in $6.00 per week.

The total weekly expenditure can be calculated as follows:

Weekly expenditure = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
Weekly expenditure = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
Weekly expenditure = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total annual expenditure can be calculated by multiplying the weekly expenditure by the number of weeks in a year (52).

Total annual expenditure = Weekly expenditure * 52
Total annual expenditure = $10.00 * 52
Total annual expenditure = $520.00

The final answer is: $520."
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we can calculate the ratio of cleaning time to the total time worked and then express it as a percentage.

First, we need to convert the total time spent cleaning to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

The custodian works for 5 days, with 8 hours per day, so the total time worked is: 
5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

Now, we can calculate the ratio of cleaning time to total time worked: 
(20 hours / 40 hours) = 0.5

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 
0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we can analyze the capacity of each shelf and the total number of books she has.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelf can hold as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, the number of books the bottom shelf can hold is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2m - 5 books.

We are given that the total number of books Elly has is 110. We can set up an equation to represent the total capacity of the shelves:

m + 2m + (2m - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

5m - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

5m = 115

Divide both sides by 5:

m = 23

Now that we know the middle shelf can hold 23 books, we can find the number of books the bottom and top shelves can hold:

Bottom shelf: 2m = 2(23) = 46 books
Top shelf: 2m - 5 = 2(23) - 5 = 41 books

To find the total capacity of the shelves, we add the number of books each shelf can hold:

Total capacity = 23 + 46 + 41 = 110 books

Since the total capacity of the shelves matches the total number of books Elly has, we can conclude that she needs only 1 bookcase to hold all of her books.

Final answer: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we can employ the concept of cost and revenue. The cost of purchasing the eggs is given as $2.40 per dozen, and Rose buys five dozens, resulting in a total cost of 5 × $2.40 = $12.

The selling price per egg is $1, and Rose sells 60 eggs in total. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated as 60 × $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of hats that are not red, which is 100 - 50 = 50. 

Next, we find the fraction of these remaining hats that are blue, which is 3/5. Multiplying this fraction by the number of non-red hats gives us the number of blue hats: (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Finally, we subtract the number of blue hats from the total number of non-red hats to find the number of white hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky, we can apply the concept of unit price, which is a fundamental principle in microeconomics. The unit price is calculated by dividing the total cost of the item by the number of units.

In this scenario, the total cost of the beef jerky is $15.00, and there are 30 sticks in a bag. Therefore, the unit price can be calculated as follows:

Unit Price = Total Cost ÷ Number of Units
= $15.00 ÷ 30
= $0.50

To express this in cents, we can multiply by 100:

Unit Price (in cents) = $0.50 × 100
= 50 cents

Thus, the cost per stick of beef jerky is 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. Since she must achieve a 70% passing score, we can set up the following equation:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110

Let x be the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test. Then, the total number of questions she needs to get correct is:

0.7(110) = 77

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6(70) = 42 questions, we can set up the following equation:

42 + x = 77

Solving for x, we get:

x = 77 - 42
x = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to achieve a 70% passing score and move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To determine the number of blueberry cubes, we can employ a linear equation-based approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. The number of blueberry cubes is given as 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as 5x - 4.

We are informed that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we obtain:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have determined the number of strawberry cubes, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can utilize the formula for calculating total points:

Total Points = Number of Games Played * Points per Game

Given:
Number of Games Played per Year = 40
Number of Years = 4
Points per Game = 21

Total Points = 40 * 4 * 21

First, we multiply the number of games played per year by the number of years to obtain the total number of games played:
40 * 4 = 160

Then, we multiply the total number of games played by the points per game:
160 * 21 = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can analyze the sequence of events. Initially, he had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 5 marbles, resulting in 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, increasing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, upon closer inspection, he discovered that one of the marbles was not a marble but a bead, so he discarded it. This means he was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can employ a linear model based on the given historical averages. Let's break down the problem into its constituent parts.

First, we need to establish the conversion rates between telephone calls, potential customers, and actual customers. We are given that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason generates 1 potential customer. This can be represented as a conversion rate of 1/25 or 0.04 (4%) for the first step.

Next, we need to calculate the conversion rate from potential customers to actual customers. We are told that for every 2 potential customers, 1 actual customer is generated. This can be represented as a conversion rate of 1/2 or 0.5 (50%) for the second step.

To find the total number of telephone calls required to generate the desired number of actual customers, we can use the formula:

Number of telephone calls = (Number of desired customers) / (Conversion rate of potential customers * Conversion rate of actual customers)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of telephone calls = 15 / (0.04 * 0.5)
= 15 / 0.02
= 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of candles and the number of flashlights.

First, let's calculate the total number of candles. Since there are 8 rooms in the house, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. We can express this as:

Total candles = (4 small candles/room) * (4 rooms) + (5 medium candles/room) * (4 rooms)
Total candles = 16 + 20
Total candles = 36

Next, we know that there are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:

Total flashlights = 4 people

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding the two quantities:

Total = Total candles + Total flashlights
Total = 36 + 4
Total = 40

= 110 chips ÷ 5
= 22 chips

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and calculate the time for each segment.

The time for the first side is given as 5 minutes. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides, which are the fourth and fifth sides, take half as long as the first side, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time by summing up the time for all sides:

Total time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5

Total time = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of items in the changing room, we can employ a systematic approach. Given that the number of helmets is 20 and that this quantity is half the number of footballs, we can establish a direct relationship between the two. Specifically, if we let F represent the number of footballs, we have:

F = 2 × H

where H denotes the number of helmets. Substituting the given value for H, we obtain:

F = 2 × 20
F = 40

Next, we are informed that the number of robots is half the number of helmets. Thus, we can express this relationship as:

R = H / 2

Substituting the value of H, we have:

R = 20 / 2
R = 10

Finally, to determine the total number of items, we sum the quantities of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total = R + H + F
Total = 10 + 20 + 40
Total = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Tim spends 6 hours per day on calls and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes spent on calls per day as 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day.

Multiplying this by the number of days in a workweek (5 days) yields a total of 360 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1800 minutes/week.

Since each call requires 15 minutes to deal with, the total number of calls can be found by dividing the total minutes spent on calls by the time required per call: 1800 minutes/week ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week.

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day workweek.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the additional time required for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we can calculate the difference in drying times.

Let's denote the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting as T1 = 7 minutes, and the time for the new varnish as T2 = 12 minutes. We are interested in finding the difference in drying time for 6 paintings, denoted as Δt.

The total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish is 6T1 = 6(7) = 42 minutes.

The total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish is 6T2 = 6(12) = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time, Δt, is given by:

Δt = 6T2 - 6T1 = 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can employ a systematic approach by categorizing the plants based on their water requirements and then summing up the individual amounts.

Let's denote the number of plants requiring half a cup of water as x. We are given that x = 4. The number of plants requiring 1 cup of water is given as 8, and the remaining plants, which require a quarter of a cup of water, can be calculated as 20 - x - 8 = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants:

- For the 4 plants requiring half a cup of water: 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups
- For the 8 plants requiring 1 cup of water: 8 * 1 = 8 cups
- For the 8 plants requiring a quarter of a cup of water: 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups

To find the total amount of water needed, we sum up the individual amounts: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the time it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we can employ the concept of average speed, as the distance covered on land and in water is equal. The total distance is 200 yards, and since half of it is on land and the other half is in water, the average speed can be calculated as:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
We can rearrange this formula to solve for time:

Time = Total distance / Average speed

Since the distance on land and in water is equal, we can calculate the average speed as:

Average speed = (20 yards/minute + 10 yards/minute) / 2
Average speed = 30 yards/minute / 2
Average speed = 15 yards/minute

Now, we can calculate the total time:

Time = Total distance / Average speed
Time = 200 yards / 15 yards/minute
Time = 13.33 minutes

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the time it will take Phineas Frog to return home is 13.33 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13.33}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of boxes required.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks needed as N, the number of sticks per box as S, and the cost per box as C. We are given that N = 56 and S = 8. We can calculate the number of boxes required as follows:

N ÷ S = 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:

Total Cost = Number of Boxes × Cost per Box
= 7 × $2.00
= $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the costs associated with the main phone and the additional phones.

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as M and the cost of each additional phone as A. We are given that M = 2A and M = $20. From this, we can solve for A: A = M / 2 = $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost of these phones is 4A = 4($10) = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones: M + 4A = $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60."
"To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we can employ the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. Given that Derrick produces 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can convert this to individual units by multiplying the number of dozens by 12, resulting in 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Since June has 30 days, Derrick's total doughnut production for the month is 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

With each doughnut selling for $2, Derrick's total earnings can be calculated as 3600 * $2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are $7200.

The final answer is: $7200"
"To determine the number of days required to upload all the photos, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that Jade uploads 7 photos in each batch and she uploads 6 batches per day, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

Number of days = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
= 210 / 7
= 30

Therefore, Jade will need 30 days to upload all her photos."
"To determine Alicia's total dry-cleaning expenditure over a 5-week period, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of each item: 
- The cost of 5 blouses at $5.00 each is 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.
- The cost of 2 pairs of pants at $8.00 each is 2 * $8.00 = $16.00.
- The cost of 1 skirt at $6.00 is $6.00.

Therefore, Alicia's total dry-cleaning expenditure over 5 weeks is $47.00."
"To determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we must first calculate his new speaking speed in words per minute. Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, his new speed can be calculated as follows:

New speed = Original speed × 2.5
New speed = 150 WPM × 2.5
New speed = 375 WPM

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words. The total number of words is given by:

Total words = Number of pages × Words per page
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words/page
Total words = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:

Time = Total words / New speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we calculate the number of people on each day:

Day 1: 50 people
Day 2: 50 + 20 = 70 people
Day 3: 70 * 2 = 140 people

For the remaining four days, Conor observed an average of 60 people per day. To find the total number of people for these days, we can multiply the average by the number of days:

60 * 4 = 240 people

Now, we add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:

50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we can analyze the pattern of kernel popping rates. The problem describes a sequence of popping rates: 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds, 3 times that amount in the next 30 seconds, 4 times the initial rate in the subsequent 30 seconds, and half the rate in the final 30 seconds.

Let's denote the initial popping rate as r. Then, the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval can be represented as:

- First 30 seconds: 20 = r * 0.5
- Next 30 seconds: 60 = r * 3
- Subsequent 30 seconds: 80 = r * 4
- Final 30 seconds: 40 = r * 0.5

Solving for r, we find that r = 20 / 0.5 = 40. Now, we can calculate the total number of kernels popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20
- Next 30 seconds: 60
- Subsequent 30 seconds: 80
- Final 30 seconds: 40

Total kernels popped = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

Total kernels popped = 200 + 10 = 210

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we must first establish the lemon juice yield per gallon. Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the lemon juice yield per gallon as follows:

1 cup / 6 lemons = 1/6 cup of lemon juice per lemon

For 5 gallons of lemonade, the total amount of lemon juice required is:

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 1 cup of lemon juice is equivalent to 6 lemons, the total number of lemons needed can be calculated as:

5 cups / (1/6 cup/lemon) = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total weekly dog food consumption, we can calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of dog food for the German Shepherds can be calculated as 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day. Similarly, the daily consumption of dog food for the Bulldogs can be calculated as 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day.

The total daily consumption of dog food for both breeds is the sum of their individual consumptions, which is 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7: 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of legs and then dividing by 2.

First, we calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of 2-legged animals by 2 and the number of 4-legged animals by 4, then summing the results.

Total legs = (10 * 2) + (15 * 4)
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

Now, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to obtain the total number of pairs of legs.

Total pairs of legs = Total legs / 2
Total pairs of legs = 80 / 2
Total pairs of legs = 40

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. Given that the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks, we can express the total number of blocks as:

4 (blue blocks) + 2 * 4 (yellow blocks) + r (red blocks) = 32 (total blocks)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4 + 8 + r = 32

Combine like terms:

12 + r = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides:

r = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, the distance covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time = 18mph × 5h = 90 miles

Subsequently, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time = 18mph × 8h = 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we need to consider the relative motion. Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can calculate the net displacement as the difference between the two distances:

Net displacement = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation using the formula:

Value after n years = Initial value * (1 - Depreciation rate)^n

Given:
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation rate = 30% in Year 1, 30% in Year 2, and 20% in Year 3

We can calculate the value after three years as follows:

Year 1:
Value after 1 year = $9000 * (1 - 0.3) = $9000 * 0.7 = $6300

Year 2:
Value after 2 years = $6300 * (1 - 0.3) = $6300 * 0.7 = $4410

Year 3:
Value after 3 years = $4410 * (1 - 0.2) = $4410 * 0.8 = $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Given that the total number of candies in the bag is 232, and we know the number of red, orange, and yellow candies, we can calculate the number of pink candies as follows:

Let's denote the number of red candies as R, orange candies as O, and yellow candies as Y. We are given that R = 54, O = 2R, and Y = R/2.

First, we can express the total number of candies in terms of R:
Total = R + O + Y = R + 2R + R/2 = 5R/2

We are given that the total number of candies is 232, so we can set up the equation:
5R/2 = 232

To solve for R, we can multiply both sides by 2/5:
R = 232 * 2/5
R = 92

Now that we know the value of R, we can find the number of orange and yellow candies:
O = 2R = 2 * 92 = 184
Y = R/2 = 92/2 = 46

Since the total number of candies is the sum of red, orange, yellow, and pink candies, we can set up the equation:
R + O + Y + P = 232

Substituting the known values, we get:
92 + 184 + 46 + P = 232

Simplifying the equation, we get:
322 + P = 232

Subtracting 322 from both sides, we get:
P = -90

However, this result is not feasible, as the number of candies cannot be negative. This indicates that the initial assumption that the total number of candies is 232 is incorrect. We must re-evaluate the problem.

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the total number of candies is actually the sum of red, orange, yellow, and pink candies:
R + O + Y + P = 232

Substituting the known values, we get:
92 + 184 + 46 + P = 232

Simplifying the equation, we get:
322 + P = 232

Subtracting 322 from both sides, we get:
P = -90

However, this result is still not feasible. We must re-evaluate the problem again.

Let's re-examine the problem statement. We are given that the bag has 54 red candies, twice that amount of orange candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies. We can express the number of orange and yellow candies in terms of R:
O = 2R = 2 * 54 = 108
Y = R/2 = 54/2 = 27

Now, we can set up the equation:
R + O + Y + P = 232

Substituting the known values, we get:
92 + 108 + 27 + P = 232

Simplifying the equation, we get:
227 + P = 232

Subtracting 227 from both sides, we get:
P = 5

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we can break down the expenses into two components: the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips.

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is given as $80 per night. Therefore, the total cost of the hotel is:

$80 per night × 3 nights = $240

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. This can be calculated as:

$80 × 0.10 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

$8 per trip × 7 trips = $56

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two components:

$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus trips) = $296

Therefore, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during her trip.

The final answer is: $296"
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as 'x'. Since Dallas initially received 'x' marbles from Mazie and ended up with 21 after dropping 4, we can set up the following equation:

x + 4 = 25

Solving for 'x', we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 4
x = 21

However, this equation is not entirely accurate, as it implies that Dallas initially received 21 marbles, which contradicts the given information. A more accurate representation of the situation would be:

Mazie gave 'x' marbles to Dallas, and Dallas initially had 25 marbles. After dropping 4, Dallas had 21. This implies that the initial number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any was 25. Since Mazie gave 'x' marbles to Dallas, we can set up the following equation:

x + 25 = 52

Solving for 'x', we subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

x = 52 - 25
x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the costs of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. The family consists of 3 individuals, so the total cost of the tickets is:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

In addition to the tickets, the family purchases 2 popcorns at $3 each. The total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

The total cost of the outing is the sum of the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the force required to move the car, we must consider the total weight of the vehicle and its contents. The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, while the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds. Additionally, there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, resulting in a total weight of 150 pounds for the children.

The total weight of the vehicle and its contents can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds.

Final Answer: The final answer is 16."

In this scenario, the length (l) of the fence is 20 feet, and the width (w) is 15 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we obtain:

P = 2(20 + 15)
P = 2(35)
P = 70

Therefore, James requires 70 feet of crepe paper to encircle his backyard fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the average age of Mia and Emma, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. Given that Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can represent their ages algebraically as:

Let's denote Mia's age as M and Emma's age as E. We are given that M = E - 16.

We are also given that Mia is 40 years old, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

40 = E - 16

To solve for E, we can add 16 to both sides of the equation:

E = 40 + 16
E = 56

Now that we have found Emma's age, we can calculate the average age by taking the arithmetic mean of their ages:

Average age = (M + E) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we add the number of seashells found by each individual: Tom (214) + Nancy (432) + Benny (86) = 732. This represents the total number of seashells initially collected.

However, we must account for the cracked seashells, which were discovered during the cleaning process. To find the number of good seashells, we subtract the number of cracked seashells (67) from the total: 732 - 67 = 665.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665.

The final answer is: $\boxed{665}$"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of plate and then sum them up. 

The cost of 12 dinner plates at $6.00 each can be calculated as 12 * $6.00 = $72.00. 

The cost of 12 salad plates at $4.00 each can be calculated as 12 * $4.00 = $48.00. 

The cost of 12 bowls at $5.00 each can be calculated as 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

Now, we can sum up the costs: $72.00 + $48.00 + $60.00 = $180.00.

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final answer is: $180.00"
"To determine Anna's time, we can utilize the concept of linear relationships. Given that Anna's time is 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we can express this relationship as:

Anna's time = (1/2) * Steve's time + 2

Since Steve's time is 10 hours, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Anna's time = (1/2) * 10 + 2
Anna's time = 5 + 2
Anna's time = 7

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we must first calculate the total daily feed consumption of Dexter's pigs. With five pigs, each consuming 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the total daily feed consumption can be calculated as follows:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the daily feed consumption by 7 to obtain the total weekly consumption:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Given that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, we can calculate the amount of feed left by subtracting the total weekly consumption from the total ordered:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, there are 20 pounds of feed left after a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each guest will consume 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed can be calculated as follows:

Total hot dogs required = Number of guests * Number of hot dogs per guest
Total hot dogs required = 20 * 2
Total hot dogs required = 40

Considering John already possesses 4 hot dogs, we can subtract these from the total to determine the number of hot dogs that need to be purchased:

Total hot dogs to purchase = Total hot dogs required - Hot dogs already available
Total hot dogs to purchase = 40 - 4
Total hot dogs to purchase = 36

Since each pack of hot dogs contains 6 units, we can calculate the number of packs required by dividing the total number of hot dogs to be purchased by the number of hot dogs per pack:

Number of packs required = Total hot dogs to purchase / Number of hot dogs per pack
Number of packs required = 36 / 6
Number of packs required = 6

Finally, to determine the total cost, we can multiply the number of packs required by the cost per pack:

Total cost = Number of packs required * Cost per pack
Total cost = 6 * $2
Total cost = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must first calculate her total revenue and total expenses.

Frances' revenue from cupcakes can be calculated as 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40. Additionally, her revenue from cookies is 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40. Therefore, her total revenue is $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances' expenses consist of the cost of 5 trays at $4 per tray, which equals 5 * $4 = $20.

To find Frances' remaining funds, we subtract her total expenses from her total revenue: $80 - $20 = $60.

Frances has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of children following the ice cream truck, we can model the situation using a sequence. Let's denote the initial number of children as $a_0 = 5$. On the second street, each of the $a_0$ children is joined by another child, resulting in $a_1 = a_0 + 5$. On the third street, each of the $a_1$ children is joined by 2 more children, leading to $a_2 = a_1 + 2a_1 = 3a_1$. Finally, the original 5 children leave the group, leaving us with $a_2 - 5$ children.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$a_2 - 5 = 3a_1 - 5$

Substituting $a_1 = a_0 + 5$, we get:

$a_2 - 5 = 3(a_0 + 5) - 5$

Simplifying the equation:

$a_2 - 5 = 3a_0 + 15 - 5$

$a_2 - 5 = 3a_0 + 10$

$a_2 = 3a_0 + 15$

Now, substituting $a_0 = 5$:

$a_2 = 3(5) + 15$

$a_2 = 15 + 15$

$a_2 = 30$

Therefore, there are 30 children following the truck.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of meals distributed over the three days. This can be achieved by adding the number of meals given out on each day: 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the total number of meals distributed from the initial total to find the number of meals remaining: 1,360 (total meals) - 142 (meals distributed) = 1,218 meals.

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. 

First, we know that the age of the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. Let's denote the age of the younger brother as 'x'. Since the younger brother is 12 years old, we can set up the equation:

x = 12

Now, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 'x' by 2:

Age of older brother = 2x
= 2(12)
= 24

Next, we know that all three sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old. To find the total age of the siblings, we can add up the ages of all the siblings:

Total age = Age of younger brother + Age of older brother + (Age of one sister * 3)
= 12 + 24 + (16 * 3)
= 12 + 24 + 48
= 84

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we can break down the problem into two components: the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day, for 4 weeks, and 7 days a week. This can be represented as:

2 * 15 * 7 * 4 = 840 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time spent on yoga from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

1 * 5 * 4 * 7 = 140 hours
140 * 60 = 8400 minutes

Now, we can add the total time spent on meditation and yoga to find the overall time spent on these activities:

840 + 8400 = 9240 minutes

To convert the total time to hours and minutes, we can divide by 60:

The area of a small t-shirt is 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt is 6 square feet. 

We can express this as an equation: 
Total Area = (Number of small shirts * Area of small shirt) + (Number of medium shirts * Area of medium shirt) + (Number of large shirts * Area of large shirt)
Total Area = (11 * 3) + (8 * 4) + (6 * 6)
Total Area = 33 + 32 + 36
Total Area = 101

Therefore, the quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Next, we need to calculate 50% of the number of seeds in a small sunflower. This can be found by multiplying 36 by 0.5, resulting in 18. 

Now, we add 50% of the seeds (18) to the number of seeds in a small sunflower (36) to obtain the total number of seeds in a large sunflower: 36 + 18 = 54.

Finally, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower (36) to the number of seeds in a large sunflower (54) to get the total number of sunflower seeds: 36 + 54 = 90.

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George, and subsequently, Sarah.

Given that Timothy has three times the number of pens as George, we can express this relationship as a ratio: Timothy's pens = 3 * George's pens. Since George has 18 pens, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:

Timothy's pens = 3 * 18
= 54

Now, we can determine the number of pens Sarah has, as she has half the number of pens as Timothy. This can be represented as:

Sarah's pens = (1/2) * Timothy's pens
= (1/2) * 54
= 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert.

Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x. We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is x + 3. We are also given that Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. Since Albert is 36 inches tall, we can express Anne's height as 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Jackie's height and Anne's height: x + 3 = 72 - 2. Solving for x, we get:

x + 3 = 70

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

x = 70 - 3

x = 67

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To determine the total revenue generated by the company from selling chocolate bars over a two-week period, we can employ the concept of unitary pricing and multiplication.

Given that the company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day and sells each bar for $2, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = Number of bars produced per day * Price per bar
= 5000 bars/day * $2/bar
= $10,000/day

To find the total revenue over a two-week period, we can multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in two weeks (14 days):

Total revenue = Daily revenue * Number of days
= $10,000/day * 14 days
= $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys two of them. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the total cost of the T-shirts as follows:

Cost of T-shirts = (1 x $8) + (0.5 x $8)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. We can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount on shoes = 0.4 x $40
= $16

The cost of the shoes is the original price minus the discount:

Cost of shoes = $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we can find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and then divide that by the cost of a single ticket.

Ryan's weekly allowance is $6, and he completed his chores for 3 weeks, resulting in a total of:
6 * 3 = $18

He then spent $1.25 on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which amounts to:
$1.25 * 4 = $5

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings yields:
$18 - $5 = $13

Now, we can calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can purchase with his remaining funds by dividing the amount he has by the cost of a single ticket:
$13 ÷ $6.50 = 2

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."
"To determine the total amount spent by Ellen and her sister, Lani, we can calculate the sum of their individual expenditures.

Ellen's purchases consist of a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. The total cost of her items can be calculated as follows:

Total cost of Ellen's items = Cost of leggings + Cost of photo frame
= $100 + $5
= $105

Lani's purchases include a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. The total cost of her items can be calculated as follows:

Total cost of Lani's items = Cost of sunglasses + (2 x Cost of a bathrobe)
= $30 + (2 x $100)
= $30 + $200
= $230

The total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani is the sum of their individual expenditures:

Total amount spent = Total cost of Ellen's items + Total cost of Lani's items
= $105 + $230
= $335

The final answer is: $335"
"To determine the profit made from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we must first calculate the total cost of producing one jar and then multiply it by 10. The cost of producing one jar consists of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.

The cost of 2 pounds of passion fruit is 2 * $6 = $12.
The cost of 1.5 pounds of jackfruit is 1.5 * $8 = $12.
The cost of 2 pounds of honey is 2 * $10 = $20.
The total cost of producing one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

To find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price: $50 - $44 = $6.

Now, to find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: 10 * $6 = $60.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total dollar amount in the jar, we can calculate the value of each type of coin and sum them together. This can be achieved by multiplying the number of coins by their respective denominations and then adding the results.

The value of the quarters is 32 x $0.25 = $8.
The value of the dimes is 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.
The value of the nickels is 120 x $0.05 = $6.
The value of the pennies is 750 x $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $31."

Amount left = $40 - $28 = $12

Therefore, Janet has $12 left.

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period, we must first calculate the number of days he is open and the corresponding number of cars serviced.

Given that Josh operates his car shop 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and is closed on Wednesday and Sunday, we can calculate the total number of days he is open in 2 weeks as 6 * 2 = 12 days.

Since Josh services 3 cars per day, the total number of cars serviced in 12 days is 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

With a payment rate of $4 per car, Josh's total earnings over 2 weeks can be calculated as 36 * $4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the total number of cookies Randy has now, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.

1. He consumes 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This results in a reduction of 3 cookies from the initial total:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar cookies: 5 - 1 = 4

2. He then consumes 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leading to a further reduction:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 (no change)

3. Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, resulting in:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 (no change)
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 (no change)
   - Sugar cookies: 4 - 2 = 2

4. Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, leading to an increase of 8 cookies in total:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

Therefore, Randy now has a total of 10 oatmeal cookies, 7 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 sugar cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of the collection. Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal groups of 6. 

The first half consists of 6 toys, and each toy is sold for $5. Therefore, the total earnings from this half can be calculated as:

6 * $5 = $30

The second half also consists of 6 toys, and each toy is sold for $7. Thus, the total earnings from this half can be calculated as:

6 * $7 = $42

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both halves:

$30 + $42 = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer.

Final answer: $72"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple yet effective approach by considering the net change in the number of holes per day. The dog's daily hole-digging rate is 6 holes, while Nate's daily hole-filling rate is 9 holes. However, the dog also digs 6 new holes every night, which needs to be accounted for.

Let's denote the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes as 't'. The total number of holes dug by the dog during this period is 6t, and the total number of holes filled by Nate is 9t. Since the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is 3 (9 - 6 = 3).

We can set up the equation to represent the situation:

6t - 3t = 84

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3t = 84

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

t = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:

t = 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

Given that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students per year, and Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students, we can express this as a fraction: (3/4) * 4000. 

To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we can multiply 4000 by 3/4, which is equivalent to 3000.

The difference in average enrollment between the two schools can be calculated by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize the principle of set theory. Let's denote the total number of cookies as T, the number of rainbow cookies as R, the number of oatmeal cookies as O, and the number of chocolate chip cookies as C. We are given the following information:

T = 7995
R = 2595
O = 3075

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of cookies as the sum of the individual types of cookies, minus the overlap between them. However, since we are not provided with any information about the overlap, we will assume that the cookies are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies can be calculated as:

C = T - (R + O)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes as T, B, and P, respectively.

We know that Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so we can write an equation for the number of test tubes Igor gathered:

T = 8 (since Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested)

We also know that Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested, so we can write an equation for the number of Petri dishes:

P = 14 + 2 = 16

The total number of items Igor had on the lab bench is 29, so we can write an equation for the total number of items:

T + B + P = 29

Substituting the values we know, we get:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 5

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers (since he had 7 beakers in total, but only 5 were on the lab bench).

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that each table has 4 legs and each leg requires 2 screws, the total number of screws needed for 4 tables can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables × Number of legs per table × Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 × 4 × 2
Total screws needed = 32

Since James has 40 screws initially, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the initial amount:

Screws left over = Initial screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over after assembling the 4 tables."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, we can express this relationship as a ratio or a mathematical expression.

Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Since the second basket contains twice as many eggs, the number of eggs in the second basket can be represented as 2x.

The total number of eggs in both baskets can be calculated by adding the number of eggs in each basket:

Total = x + 2x
Total = 3x

Since we know that the first basket contains 10 eggs, we can substitute x = 10 into the equation:

Total = 3(10)
Total = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To determine the total amount of money raised, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Sarah raised as 'x'. Since Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, the amount Maryam raised is x + $400. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, who raised $430, so the amount Kim raised is $430 + $320 = $750. 

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money raised: x + (x + $400) + $750 + $300 = Total.

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + $1450 = Total.

We know that Sarah raised $300, so we can substitute x with $300: 2($300) + $1450 = Total.

Simplifying the equation, we get: $600 + $1450 = Total.

Therefore, the total amount of money raised is $2050.

The final answer is $2050."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative rates and proportions. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as A = 2V.

We are also given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, while Aaron ran 2 miles. Since they completed their respective distances in the same amount of time, we can set up a proportion to relate their speeds and distances:

A / 2 = V / 4

Substituting A = 2V into the equation, we get:

2V / 2 = V / 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

V = 2V / 4
V = V / 2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2V = V

Subtracting V from both sides, we get:

V = 16

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance by her speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 16 miles/minute
Time = 1/4 hour
Time = 15 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 15 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and the existing dock measures 200 feet, the total line required can be calculated as follows:

Total line required = 3 feet/dock * 200 feet = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he has from the total required:

Total line to purchase = Total line required - Line already available
= 600 feet - 6 feet
= 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"To determine the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, with each reservation consisting of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (Number of reservations per night) * (Number of meals per reservation) * (Cost per meal) + (Cost of wine per day)
= 6 * 2 * $5 + $5
= $60 + $5
= $65 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue can be calculated by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of operating days:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * Number of operating days
= $65 * 2
= $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can employ the concept of percentage increase. Given that the vendor sold all 50 watermelons at a profit of 25%, we can calculate the selling price per unit using the following formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Cost Price × Profit Percentage)

In this scenario, the cost price per unit is $1.60, and the profit percentage is 25% or 0.25. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Selling Price = $1.60 + ($1.60 × 0.25)
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps. 

First, we need to find the current age of James. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate James' current age as follows:

Let's denote Dora's current age as D. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can set up the equation: D + 3 = 12. Solving for D, we get D = 12 - 3 = 9.

Now that we know Dora's current age, we can find James' current age, which is twice Dora's age: James' current age = 2 * D = 2 * 9 = 18.

Next, we need to find John's current age. We know that James was born when John was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. So, John's current age can be calculated as: John's current age = 19 + 18 = 37.

Finally, we need to find John's youngest son's current age. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son's current age can be calculated as: John's youngest son's current age = 37 - 32 = 5.

To find John's youngest son's age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age: John's youngest son's age in 3 years = 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane, we can model their peeling rates as discrete-time processes. Let's denote the time elapsed in minutes as t. Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes, while Jane peels an orange every 4 minutes.

The number of oranges peeled by Ana at time t is given by the floor function of t/3, denoted as ⌊t/3⌋. Similarly, the number of oranges peeled by Jane at time t is given by ⌊t/4⌋.

We want to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after 60 minutes. This can be represented as:

Difference = ⌊60/3⌋ - ⌊60/4⌋

Since ⌊60/3⌋ = 20 and ⌊60/4⌋ = 15, the difference is:

Difference = 20 - 15 = 5

Therefore, Ana will peel 5 more oranges than Jane after 60 minutes.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to consider the discounted price and the labor costs.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark obtains it at an 80% discount, which can be calculated as:

Discount = 80% of $400 = 0.8 * $400 = $320

The discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost:

Total Cost = Discounted Radiator Price + Labor Cost
= $80 + $150
= $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the new radiator.

Final answer: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x in both equations the same:

2x + 2y = 40

Now, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate x:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
2y = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 15

Now that we have found y, we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we can employ the concept of division. Given that there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 × 8 = 56.

With 4 people sharing the pizzas equally, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find the number of slices each person can have. This can be represented as:

Total slices ÷ Number of people = 56 ÷ 4

Simplifying the expression, we get:

56 ÷ 4 = 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
