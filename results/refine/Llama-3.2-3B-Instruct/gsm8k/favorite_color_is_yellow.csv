"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.

Next, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her remaining eggs to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, we can calculate her daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs sold (9) by the price per egg ($2).

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding the blue and white fiber:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the profit made by Josh after flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Number of meters per sprint: 60

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"As a poultry nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Wendi's chicken feeding schedule.

To determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock. Since each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. To find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to provide 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"Sheep population calculations can be a fascinating topic, and I'm happy to help. As a sheep expert, I can assure you that the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle can be calculated using simple arithmetic.

Let's break it down step by step:

Seattle has 20 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 
20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the interrupted download. Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. 

Time taken for the first download = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

The download is then interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 80 minutes.

Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Let's break down John's journey into segments to determine the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Now, he drives for 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from each segment:
Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Let's break down Eliza's earnings into two parts: regular hours and overtime hours.

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to calculate the overtime rate. Since Eliza receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, the overtime rate is:
$10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Now, let's calculate the earnings for the overtime hours:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the number of downloads in the first month as D1, the number of downloads in the second month as D2, and the number of downloads in the third month as D3.

We know that D1 = 60.

D2 is three times the number of downloads in the first month, so D2 = 3 * D1 = 3 * 60 = 180.

D3 is 30% less than D2, so D3 = 0.7 * D2 = 0.7 * 180 = 126.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of D1, D2, and D3: Total = D1 + D2 + D3 = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we can break down the costs as follows:

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = $160

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"The art of calculating the break-even point for a lemon tree investment! As a citrus expert, I'd be delighted to guide you through this problem.

To determine the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost, annual income, and annual expenses.

Initial cost of the tree: $90
Annual income from lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year
Annual expenses: $3/year

Net profit per year: $10.50 (income) - $3 (expenses) = $7.50/year

To find the break-even point, we can divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

$90 (initial cost) / $7.50 (net profit per year) = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"As a door-to-door saleswoman, I've encountered various sales scenarios, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x. Melanie sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms: x - x/3 - x/6 - 1 = 5

To simplify, find a common denominator (6): 6x/6 - 2x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 5 + 1

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 6

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 4x - 6 = 36

Add 6 to both sides: 4x = 42

Divide both sides by 4: x = 42/4

x = 10.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the correct answer is not a whole number, which is not possible in this scenario. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to set up the equation as follows:

x - (x/3 + 2 + (x/6 - 1)) = 5

Combine like terms: x - x/3 - x/6 - 1 = 5

To simplify, find a common denominator (6): 6x/6 - 2x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 5 + 1

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 6

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

"As a financial analyst specializing in investment and market trends, I've analyzed the potential returns on both options. To maximize profit, we need to consider the projected market growth for both the jewelry and electronic gadgets.

The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets market is projected to rise by 1.2%. To calculate the potential value of each option:

Jewelry: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250
Electronic gadgets: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Comparing the potential values, the electronic gadgets offer a higher return. To determine the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the potential value:

Profit = Potential value - Initial cost
For jewelry: $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
For electronic gadgets: $8,160 - $8,000 = $160

Based on the analysis, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit. The correct answer is:

A) $250
B) $160
C) $500
D) $1,000

The correct answer is B."
"As a transportation expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a solution.

Since the two trains left San Rafael at the same time and traveled westward for 80 miles each, they are now 80 miles apart. On the second day, they traveled northward for 150 miles each, which means they are now 80 miles apart in the north-south direction.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to consider the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Let's denote the distance covered by each train as 'd'. Since they are 80 miles apart in the east-west direction and 150 miles apart in the north-south direction, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find 'd':

d² = 80² + 150²
d² = 6400 + 22500
d² = 28900
d = √28900
d = 170

So, each train covered a total distance of 170 miles.

The final answer is: 170"
"As a financial analyst specializing in salary calculations, I'd be happy to help you determine Jill's annual salary.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Weekly earnings: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700 * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Weekly earnings: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450 * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. Claire makes 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will make 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs):
84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for Marissa to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can use the concept of average speed and the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the desired average speed (4 miles per hour) and the total distance (12 miles). We also know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. 

Let's denote the time spent walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be the sum of the time spent walking the first 6 miles (2 hours) and the time spent walking the remaining distance (t hours).

Total Time = 2 + t

We can set up the equation using the average speed formula:

4 = 12 / (2 + t)

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t):

4(2 + t) = 12

Expanding the equation:

8 + 4t = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

4t = 4

Dividing both sides by 4:

t = 1

Now that we know the time spent walking the remaining distance (1 hour), we can calculate the required speed:

Required Speed = Distance / Time

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two drinks: orange and pineapple. The orange drink is 2/3 water, and we have 10 liters of it. The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, and we have 15 liters of it. We want to find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after spilling 1 liter of the orange drink.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in each drink:

Orange drink: 10 liters * (2/3) = 20/3 liters
Pineapple drink: 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters

Now, let's add the amount of water in both drinks:
Total water = 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters

However, we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, so we need to subtract that from the total amount of water:
Remaining water = 49/3 - 1 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 ÷ 3 = 14.67

The final answer is: 14.67"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is currently 31 years old. To find Raymond's current age, we subtract 6 from Samantha's age.

Raymond's current age = Samantha's age - 6
= 31 - 6
= 25

Now, we know Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago the son was born, we subtract the son's age from Raymond's current age.

Years ago the son was born = Raymond's current age - son's age
= 25 - 23
= 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To calculate the total number of DVDs sold, we can break down the sales into separate groups and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers. Since each of them bought one DVD, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 3.

Next, we have the next 2 customers who bought 2 DVDs each. To find the total number of DVDs sold to this group, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each bought: 2 x 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 0.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total length of the candle that melts, we need to calculate the difference in hours between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

The time difference is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can multiply the time difference by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we can use the formula:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items and subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total cost of Mishka's clothing items, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Shorts x Price per Short) + (Number of Pants x Price per Pant) + (Number of Shoes x Price per Shoe)

Given:
- Number of Shorts = 3
- Price per Short = $16.50
- Number of Pants = 3
- Price per Pant = $22.50
- Number of Shoes = 3
- Price per Shoe = $42

Total Cost = (3 x $16.50) + (3 x $22.50) + (3 x $42)
Total Cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
Total Cost = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To calculate the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to determine the number of cartons she will purchase and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

Let's break it down:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, since the second stop is before the end of the trip, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. This would result in a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. 

Instead, we should calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop directly. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop: 20 + 15 = 35 miles

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the cost of the two pairs of heels is $99, and the boots cost five dollars less than this total. To find the cost of the boots, we can subtract $5 from the total cost of the heels.

Cost of boots = Total cost of heels - $5
Cost of boots = $99 - $5
Cost of boots = $94

Therefore, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To calculate the average guess, we need to find the total number of jelly beans guessed by all three individuals and then divide by the number of guesses.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"As a canine care expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the time spent on dog care. To calculate the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can calculate the total daily care time as follows:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find the total weekly care time, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's dive into the world of coin counting and solve the problem.

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use algebra to represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which equals 110. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25.

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"Yogurt Consumption Calculator

As a nutrition expert, I can help you calculate Terry's yogurt expenses. To determine the total cost of yogurts over 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of yogurts consumed and then multiply it by the cost of one yogurt.

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, so in 30 days, he consumes 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts.

Since the yogurts are on sale for 4 for $5, we can calculate the cost of one yogurt as follows:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts = 15 sets of yogurts
Cost of one yogurt = $5 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we can multiply the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days by the cost of one yogurt:

60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the initial amount of money he had and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he had $35 left after buying the video games, we can infer that he initially had $35 + $5 = $40.

Now, we know John initially had $40 and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. Since he initially had 13 Lego sets and sold them all, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total weekly running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

Since John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate his total weekly running time as follows:

Total weekly running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total weekly running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total weekly running time = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's break down the information step by step to determine the age of Brandon's iPhone.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, we can calculate Ben's iPhone age as follows:

Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age
Ben's iPhone age = 2 * 1
Ben's iPhone age = 2 years

Now, we are told that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. To find Brandon's iPhone age, we can multiply Ben's iPhone age by 4:

Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age
Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * 2
Brandon's iPhone age = 8 years

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone is three times her throwing distance without the gemstone. Let's denote the throwing distance without the gemstone as x. Then, the throwing distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1200.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 1200 / 3 = 400.

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames. This distance is the difference between the throwing distance with the gemstone (3x) and the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet): 3x - 1000.

Substituting the value of x, we get: 3(400) - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. We also know that the remaining pieces are 14. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests can be calculated as: P = T - remaining pieces
P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then find out how many servings you can have.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 * 300 = 240g

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"As a beekeeping expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Charlie's candle-making business.

To calculate the net profit, we need to consider the cost of materials and the selling price of the candles. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the wicks, and he sells each candle for $2.00, we can calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the wicks, and he used 1 pound of beeswax, the total cost is:

Total cost = 1 pound * $10.00 per pound
Total cost = $10.00

However, we need to account for the cost of the wicks. Since the cost of the wicks is already included in the initial cost of the pound of beeswax, we don't need to add it separately.

Now, we can calculate the net profit:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"As a freelance blogger specializing in health topics, I've analyzed Meredith's writing schedule to calculate the total hours she spent on articles. To do this, I'll break down her writing activities for each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, each taking an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. With each article taking 4 hours, the total hours spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total hours spent writing articles in the three days, I'll add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse. She then purchased a package of Post-it notes and used 220 notes at work. After that, she had 23 notes remaining.

To find the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially, we need to add the notes she had in her purse and the notes she used at work. This can be represented as:

Initial notes = Notes in purse + Notes used at work
Initial notes = 80 + 220
Initial notes = 300

However, Candice had 23 notes remaining. So, the total number of notes she had initially must be 300 + 23 = 323.

Since Candice initially had 80 notes in her purse, the number of notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243.

The final answer is: 243"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can represent the number of blue ties as 'x'. This means the number of red ties is 2x.

The cost of a blue tie is $40, and the cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. We can represent the cost of a red tie as 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on blue ties is $200, so we can set up the equation:
40x = 200

To find the number of blue ties, we can divide both sides by 40:
x = 200 / 40
x = 5

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties:
2x = 2 * 5
2x = 10

The total amount spent on blue ties is $200, and the total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600. The total amount spent on ties is:
200 + 600 = $800

"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units and then find the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"As an expert in agricultural economics, I can provide a detailed analysis of Lloyd's egg farm.

To calculate the weekly revenue from egg sales, we need to consider the number of eggs produced and sold per week. Given that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can calculate the total number of eggs produced per week as follows:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from egg sales per week:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we can start by calculating the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"As a tire repair expert, I can analyze the given scenario to determine the day with higher revenue.

To calculate the total revenue for each day, we need to consider the number of truck tires and car tires repaired.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, Friday's revenue ($480) is greater than Thursday's revenue ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is $40."
"The problem can be solved by adding the number of kittens adopted by the Doubtfire sisters to the number of kittens born to their two house cats. 

First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying 12 by 3. 

P = 3 * 12
P = 36

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens (7) to the number of kittens Patchy had (36) and the number of kittens Trixie had (12). 

Total kittens = 7 + 36 + 12
Total kittens = 55

The Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the remaining lollipops are:
30 - 2 = 28

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. This leaves 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds available for the weight of the boxes.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes as follows:

Maximum number of boxes = Available weight for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 pounds / 15 pounds
= 16.33

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the total weight does not exceed the bridge's limit. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to determine the total amount of the extra fees and then add the tip.

First, we calculate the 25% fee, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee to get a total of $13.00 in extra fees.

Next, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00. Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to get the final price: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

"To determine the number of good oranges, we need to first find the total number of oranges that are not good. 

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, construction, and insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be calculated as 0.10 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch is $1430.

The final answer is: $1430"
"Let's break down Marcy's pension calculation into two parts: the fixed annual pension and the 5% annual pension.

Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. This is a straightforward calculation:

Fixed pension for 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

5% of $1,000,000 = $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is the sum of the fixed pension and the 5% pension:

Fixed pension for 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
5% pension for 10 years = $50,000/year * 0.05 * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:

Average annual pension = Total amount / Total years = $525,000 / 30 years = $17,500

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to consider the monthly subscription fee and the discount applied to the second half of the year.

The monthly subscription fee is $140. For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 months of this amount:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To find the discounted amount, we calculate 10% of the original monthly fee:
140 * 0.1 = $14
The discounted monthly fee for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, Aleena paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can help Sophia determine how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. To do this, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her vehicle.

We know that Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. To find the remaining capacity, we subtract the used amount from the total capacity:

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon by dividing the miles traveled by the remaining gallons:

100 miles ÷ 8 gallons = 12.5 miles per gallon

So, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles per gallon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To calculate the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to consider Jim's daily habits. 

Since Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time (1 hour), the total daily hours spent on both activities is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 

As he repeats this pattern 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. 

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have four schools, each with two teams: a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team. Each team has 5 players, and each school also sent a coach.

To find the total number of players, we multiply the number of teams per school by the number of players per team: 2 teams per school * 5 players per team = 10 players per school. Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Next, we need to add the number of coaches. Each school sent one coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"Treasure hunters often face intriguing challenges when deciphering the contents of a buried treasure chest. In this case, we're presented with a treasure chest containing diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. To determine the total number of gems, we need to analyze the given information.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so we can calculate it as: Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140.
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we can calculate it as: Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies = 2 * 140 = 280.

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595.

The final answer is: $\boxed{595}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. To find out how much money she started with, we need to subtract the total amount of her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of 8 weeks.

Let's denote the initial amount as x. The total amount at the end of 8 weeks is $100. We can set up the equation:

x + 5(8) = 100

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

x + 40 = 100

Subtract 40 from both sides:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

So, Bailey started with $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday. To find out how much she makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and she teaches 5 classes per day, so the total number of classes on weekdays is 5 * 5 = 25.

Next, we add the 8 classes she teaches on Saturday to get the total number of classes in a week: 25 + 8 = 33.

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Finally, Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

"When analyzing the problem, we can use the concept of a geometric series to find the total square footage of the sandcastle. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as a geometric sequence: 16, 8, 4, 2.

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) * 2
= 30

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

Average = S / n
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To calculate the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to consider the feeding schedule for the puppy.

The puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. This can be calculated as:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is the sum of these two amounts:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

"To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to first determine the amount of laundry each person does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up an equation to find David's laundry:

Let's denote David's laundry as x. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

Now that we know David's laundry, we can find Raymond's laundry, which is half of Sarah's laundry:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

"Let's dive into the world of sports statistics. As a football enthusiast, I'll apply my knowledge to solve this problem.

We know that the football team played a total of 22 games. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which equals 22. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we have the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x:
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

"As a salary increase expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service.

To calculate Sylvie's salary, we'll apply the 10% annual increase to her salary for each year. 

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

We know that Cindy has 4 pets.

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can express this as an equation: Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2. Substituting the value of Cindy's pets, we get Marcia's pets = 4 + 2 = 6.

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so we can express this as an equation: Jan's pets = 3 * Marcia's pets. Substituting the value of Marcia's pets, we get Jan's pets = 3 * 6 = 18.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has: Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

We have four siblings: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This implies that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, we can calculate Amy's age as 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now, we need to find Jackson's age. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, we can set up an equation: Amy's age = Jackson's age + 5. Substituting Amy's age, we get 9 = Jackson's age + 5.

To find Jackson's age, we need to isolate the variable. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

9 - 5 = Jackson's age + 5 - 5
4 = Jackson's age

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentage increase. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2
38 = x + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
x = 38 - 2
x = 36 seconds

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by dividing his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement).
Gerald's new time = 36 / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 32.73 seconds

The final answer is 32.73."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. If we let D represent the number of dogs and C represent the number of cats, we can express this relationship as:

R = D + C - 12

We are also given that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write:

C = 2D

Substituting this expression for C into the first equation, we get:

R = D + 2D - 12
R = 3D - 12

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

R = 3(60) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

The final answer is: 348"

Since Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours, we can find the difference by subtracting the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final answer is: 3"
"To determine the number of tomatoes used, we can start by finding the total ounces of tomatoes used. Since the sauce made 32 ounces and it's half the volume of the tomatoes, we can multiply 32 by 2 to get the total ounces of tomatoes used.

32 * 2 = 64 ounces

Since each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, we can divide the total ounces of tomatoes used by 16 to find the number of cans used.

64 ÷ 16 = 4 cans

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can multiply the number of cans used by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes used.

4 * 3 = 12 tomatoes

The final answer is 12."
"Let's analyze the situation. We know that the total number of cars on the motorway is 30, and 5 cars took an exit, leaving 25 cars that drove through the traffic jam. Since the remaining 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, we can set up an equation to find the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.

Let x be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. We can write the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 20
x = 5

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"As a gardening expert, I can help Mary determine the number of potted plants she will have left after giving some away.

To calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has, we need to multiply the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges. Since each ledge has 2 potted plants, and there are 40 ledges, the total number of potted plants is:

2 * 40 = 80

Now, Mary will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants. To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had:

80 - 40 = 40

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the total number of pages from all the textbooks. 

The total number of pages from all the textbooks is the sum of the pages from each subject: 
4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"Let's break down John's water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day, and there are 5 weekdays. To find the total number of glasses he drinks on weekdays, we can multiply the number of glasses per day by the number of days: 3 * 5 = 15.

On weekends, John drinks 2 glasses of water per day, and there are 2 weekend days. To find the total number of glasses he drinks on weekends, we can multiply the number of glasses per day by the number of days: 2 * 2 = 4.

To find the total number of glasses John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we can represent this as a ratio: 5 cookies for Amir to 3 cookies for Cody. To find the total number of cookies eaten by both, we can add the number of cookies eaten by each.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let A be the number of cookies eaten by Amir and C be the number of cookies eaten by Cody. We know that C = 3A and A = 5. We can substitute the value of A into the equation for C: C = 3(5) = 15. Now, we can add the number of cookies eaten by each: A + C = 5 + 15 = 20.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total inner volume of the boxes, we need to find the inner dimensions of the box and then multiply them together. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions.

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"Let's break down Frankie's TV watching schedule to determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1-hour episodes, which is equivalent to 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

To find the time he watched on Wednesday, we subtract the total time watched on other days from the total time watched: 7 - (2 + 1.5 + 2) = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode is 30 minutes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes watched on Wednesday by the length of a single episode (30 minutes) to find the number of episodes: 90 / 30 = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"As a fuel efficiency expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

The total cost of gas can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

The cashback amount can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons by the cashback per gallon:

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Now, we subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of gas to get the final cost:

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups and then divide by 2.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which Julia's boat is taking on water and then calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time she reaches the shore.

First, let's find Julia's rowing speed. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 20 feet / 16 seconds
Speed = 1.25 feet/second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the rate at which the boat takes on water as follows:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have 4 teachers sharing a whiteboard, and each teacher uses it 2 times a day. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson. To find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to multiply the number of teachers by the number of lessons per day and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day = Number of teachers * Number of lessons per day * Number of times cleaned per lesson
= 4 * 2 * 3

"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to understand the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and the capacity of Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship.

Let's denote the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as B and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as D. We know that B = 300 (as calculated earlier). We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone. This can be represented as:

1800 = 6B

To find the value of B, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

B = 1800 / 6
B = 300

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be represented as:

B = 50D

Substituting the value of B, we get:

300 = 50D

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

D = 300 / 50
D = 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

"As a seasoned lumber expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate Sasha's profit.

To determine the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we can multiply the number of boards by the cost per board: 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

Now, let's add the total cost of both types of boards: $100 + $80 = $180.

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

To find the total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we multiply the number of boards by the selling price per board: 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

Similarly, we calculate the total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

Now, let's add the total revenue from both types of boards: $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not required, we can directly focus on the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to total parts is 7/20. We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation:

7/20 = 120/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7x = 120 * 20

7x = 2400

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 2400 / 7

x = 342.86 (approximately)

So, Katy used approximately 343 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: 343"
"To calculate the total amount John paid for the shoes, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Pairs * Cost per Pair

Given:
Number of Pairs = 2
Cost per Pair = $60
Number of Children = 3

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, we multiply the number of pairs by the number of children:

Total Pairs = 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we multiply the total pairs by the cost per pair:

Total Cost = 6 * $60
Total Cost = $360

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple arithmetic sequence where we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

We know that there were initially 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, resulting in a total of 10 vehicles. On the second day, the total number of vehicles increased to 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the final number:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:

20 vehicles ÷ 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to consider their individual salary increases.

First, we know that Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago. Since his salary increased by 30% in the first instance, we can calculate his current salary as follows:

Adrien's current salary = $40,000 + 30% of $40,000
= $40,000 + 0.3 * $40,000
= $40,000 + $12,000
= $52,000

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40,000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.3
= $30,769.23

Now, we need to find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of $30,769.23 = 0.4 * $30,769.23
= $12,307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30,769.23 + $12,307.69
= $43,076.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
= $52,000 + $43,076.92
= $95,076.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95,076.92."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad. To find out how many sheets of paper he uses every month, we need to multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply 2 pads per week by 4 weeks per month:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Now, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Since the problem doesn't specify the type of fruit, we can consider them as separate entities. The total number of fruits Morisette brought is 5 + 8 = 13.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's add the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought: 13 + 14 = 27.

Therefore, Morisette and Kael have 27 fruits in total.

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and the distance covered at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

The distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 30 miles

The distance covered at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
= 20 miles

To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the two distances together:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
= 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

Final answer: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps and a pile of letters already stamped. She stamps one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we need to find the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began. Let's denote the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began as x. Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the pile now is x + 20. We are given that the number of letters in the pile now is 30.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: x = 30 - 20

x = 10

Therefore, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jenni began is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package as x.

We know that Julia initially bought a package of spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to find the number of fish sausages. Since Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can add 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

We are given that Lily has 50 friends, so we can substitute L = 50 into the equation: A = 50 + 20.

Simplifying the equation, we get A = 70.

Now, to find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Amy and Lily have: A + L = 70 + 50.

Calculating the sum, we get 120.

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"As a citrus and vegetable expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem.

To find the total cost of the items Dillon is buying, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. 

First, we know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = 45$. 

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 45 - 5 = 40$. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$
- 10 oranges: 10 * 40 = 400$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the profit, we need to find the total revenue and subtract the total cost. 

First, we calculate the total time spent on patients:
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

The hospital charges the patients $200 an hour and the doctors $150 an hour. To find the total revenue, we need to calculate the revenue from patients and doctors separately.

Revenue from patients: 
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Revenue from doctors: 
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Total revenue: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there is no cost mentioned for the hospital, the total cost is $0.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $130,000 - $0
Profit = $130,000

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 60 elves. A third of them quit after children vomit on them. To find the number of elves that quit, we can divide 60 by 3.

60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit. To find the number of elves remaining, we subtract 20 from the original 60.

60 - 20 = 40

Now, 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves.

40 - 10 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 elves left.

The final answer is 30."

Total annual cost: 48 car washes/year * $15/car wash = $720/year

Therefore, Tom's annual car wash expenses will be $720.

The final answer is: $720"
"To determine the number of video games Bobby has, we need to first calculate Brian's current video game collection. Since Brian initially had 20 video games but lost 5, we can calculate his current collection as follows:

Brian's current video games = Initial video games - Lost video games
Brian's current video games = 20 - 5
Brian's current video games = 15

Now, we can calculate Bobby's video games using the given relationship: Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. This can be represented as:

Bobby's video games = 3 * Brian's video games - 5
Bobby's video games = 3 * 15 - 5
Bobby's video games = 45 - 5
Bobby's video games = 40

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To determine the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can follow a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find the total number of Scottish unicorns, which is one third of the total number of unicorns. Since there are 27 unicorns in total, we can calculate this as:

Total Scottish unicorns = Total unicorns / 3
Total Scottish unicorns = 27 / 3
Total Scottish unicorns = 9

Now, we know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find the number of female Scottish unicorns, we can multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3:

Number of female Scottish unicorns = Total Scottish unicorns * 2/3
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 9 * 2/3
Number of female Scottish unicorns = 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"As a math enthusiast, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is 2 x $7.50 = $15.00.
The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is 2 x $1.50 = $3.00.
The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is 2 x $1.00 = $2.00.

The total cost of the order is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

A 20% delivery fee is added to the total cost, which is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00.

The total cost with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, adding a $5.00 tip brings the total cost to $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

The final answer is: $29.00"
"To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract it from the total number of questions in each test.

Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 8 hours in the first test, so he completed 5 * 8 = 40 questions.

Mark completed 5 questions per hour for 6 hours in the second test, so he completed 5 * 6 = 30 questions.

In total, Mark completed 40 + 30 = 70 questions.

Since the first test had 75 questions and Mark completed 70, he left 75 - 70 = 5 questions incomplete.

The final answer is 5."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We can represent this relationship as an equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * Number of blue gumballs + 22

We are given that the number of blue gumballs is 12. To find the number of pink gumballs, we can plug in this value into the equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4 * 12 + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

We know that there are 20 cars in total, and we need to find the number of semi-automatic cars. Since 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, we can subtract these from the total to find the number of semi-automatic cars:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can plug this value into the formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"In the context of apiculture, understanding the dynamics between the different bee populations within a hive is crucial for effective management. When analyzing the given information, we can establish the following relationships:

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as babies (W = 2B) and twice as many babies as queens (B = 2Q).

We can express the total number of bees as the sum of the three populations: W + B + Q = 700.

Substituting the relationships between the populations, we get: W + 2W + 2Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we have: 3W + 2Q = 700.

Since we want to find the number of worker bees (W), we need to determine the value of Q. We can use the relationship B = 2Q to express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Substituting B = 2Q into the equation 3W + 2Q = 700, we get: 3W + 2(2Q) = 700.

Simplifying, we have: 3W + 4Q = 700.

Now, we need another equation to solve for W. We can use the relationship W = 2B to express W in terms of B: W = 2B.

Substituting W = 2B into the equation 3W + 4Q = 700, we get: 3(2B) + 4Q = 700.

Simplifying, we have: 6B + 4Q = 700.

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute this into the equation: 6(2Q) + 4Q = 700.

Expanding, we get: 12Q + 4Q = 700.

Combining like terms, we have: 16Q = 700.

Dividing both sides by 16, we get: Q = 700/16 = 43.75.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of worker bees: W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 2(2*43.75) = 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate Jordan's potential earnings if he spent his video game time working, we need to determine the total hours he would work in a week. Since he plays video games for 2 hours every day, we can multiply the number of hours he plays per day by the number of days in a week.

Total hours worked in a week = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, we can multiply the total hours worked by his hourly wage to find his total earnings.

Total earnings = Total hours worked * Hourly wage
= 14 hours/week * $10/hour
= $140/week

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 per week if he spent his video game time working.

Final answer: $140"
"As a financial analyst specializing in retail pricing and taxation, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs.

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items. 

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost of everything: $11 (non-food items) + $5 (food items) = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"As a financial analyst specializing in small business operations, I've reviewed Kim's housekeeping business calculations. To determine the profit, we need to calculate the total expenses and subtract it from the total income.

Kim's expenses consist of bleach and cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and he needs 2 bottles per client. With 8 clients, the total number of bleach bottles required is 8 * 2 = 16. The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.

Similarly, the cost of cloths is $5 per pack, and Kim needs 1 pack per client. With 8 clients, the total number of cloths required is 8 * 1 = 8. The total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Now, let's calculate the profit. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.

Total income = $92
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"As a citrus expert, I can provide a precise calculation for John's pineapple harvest.

To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to consider the yield per hectare and the frequency of harvesting. Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year as follows:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can break it down into three separate calculations.

First, we have the initial 500-piece box. Then, we have a box with 3 times more pieces, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. Lastly, we have a box with 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, which is 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: 2125"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

First, let's calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the first 6 hours: 30 bees.

In the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

Then, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.

The total number of bees that left before the last 6 hours is 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the adult ticket and the child ticket.

Total cost = Cost of adult ticket + Cost of child ticket
Total cost = $12 + $10
Total cost = $22

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Total cost = Amount given to cashier + Change received
$22 = Amount given to cashier + $8

To find the amount given to the cashier, we need to isolate the variable. We can do this by subtracting $8 from both sides of the equation:

Amount given to cashier = $22 - $8
Amount given to cashier = $14

The final answer is: $14"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We can represent this as an equation:

Charlie's friends = 3 * Dorothy's friends

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

12 = 3 * Dorothy's friends

To find Dorothy's friends, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3
Dorothy's friends = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4:

James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to cover their respective distances.

First, let's convert the distances to feet: 
Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for each person to get home:
Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between their times to determine how long Tim will be waiting:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

"The problem at hand involves a series of events that affect the number of french fries in a pack. To solve this, we can work backwards.

Let's denote the original number of fries as 'x'. 

1. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the original amount. This can be represented as: 1/3 * x = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 5 * 3 = 15.

2. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 15 - 9 = 6.

3. A seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 6 - 7 = -1. However, since we cannot have a negative number of fries, this indicates an error in the previous steps. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 6 - 7 = -1. However, we should re-examine the initial steps.

Let's re-evaluate the problem from the beginning.

1. Dave ate 14 fries, leaving 43 - 14 = 29 fries.

2. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 29 - 7 = 22.

3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 22 - 9 = 13.

4. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's call the remaining fries 'y'. Then, 1/3 of 'y' is 13. So, y = 13 * 3 = 39.

5. The raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries, so the remaining fries after the raccoon ate 2/3 is 1/3 of the original amount. Let's call the original amount 'z'. Then, 1/3 of 'z' is 39. So, z = 39 * 3 = 117.

The final answer is: 117"
"As a math enthusiast, I'd be delighted to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on each type of day and then add them up.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, so he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, so he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. Since there are 2 days, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 9 * 16 = 144 hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 * 16 = 128 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes is 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

"To calculate the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert each type of baked good to feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, let's convert the length of the croissants to feet:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Now, let's convert the length of the baguettes to feet:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Finally, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in managing primate populations, I can confidently calculate the total number of bananas required for the apes.

To determine the total number of bananas needed, we must consider the monthly consumption of each species. The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption of each species by 2:

Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs a total distance of 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs a total distance of 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

"Let's dive into the world of marine biology and tackle this problem.

To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Lastly, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15

"Let's tackle this problem with a fresh perspective.

We're dealing with a simple algebraic equation, and I'm excited to dive into it. The problem states that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, and in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. We can represent Seth's current age as x and Brooke's current age as x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify, let's combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and add them together.

Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Total legs = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs

The final answer is: $\boxed{1210}$"
"Let's break down the information given to determine the total age of the four birds.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"As a financial analyst, I've broken down Jessica's monthly payments to determine her annual expenditure. To calculate the total monthly payment, I added the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage:

Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, I calculated 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, I added the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, I multiplied the monthly payment by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. Since the potatoes are roughly the same size, we can assume that the time to peel and cut each potato is consistent.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut one potato is 5 seconds. To add these values, we need to convert the time to cut the potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

To find the total time to prepare 60 potatoes, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"The art of calculating lemonade profits! As a lemonade connoisseur, I'd be delighted to help you crack this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade, and we know the following:

- The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
- They sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon.
- The total profit made is $25.

To find the total revenue, we can multiply the number of glasses sold per gallon by the price per glass: 20 glasses/gallon * $0.50/glass = $10/gallon.

Now, let's set up an equation to find the total cost: Revenue - Cost = Profit. We know the revenue is $10/gallon, and the profit is $25. So, we can write:

$10 - Cost = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:

$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:

$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

The final answer is: $35"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple ratio-based problem. 

We know the total number of Asians is 240, and the number of Japanese participants is 80. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asians.

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Now, we're given that the number of Chinese boys is 60. To find the number of Chinese girls, we subtract the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100.

The final answer is 100."
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $350"
"To calculate the total number of crabs, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R. We are given that B = 40, M = B - 4, and R = M + 10.

We can substitute the value of M into the equation for R: R = (B - 4) + 10
R = B + 6

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for R: R = 40 + 6
R = 46

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: 
B + M + R = 40 + (40 - 4) + 46
B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46
B + M + R = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Let's break down Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks.

To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked for each week and then add the results.

Hourly wage: $10
Hours worked in the first week: 5
Hours worked in the second week: 8

Total earnings for the first week: $10/hour * 5 hours = $50
Total earnings for the second week: $10/hour * 8 hours = $80

Total earnings for the first two weeks: $50 + $80 = $130

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the loser got the remaining 1/4 of the votes.

Number of votes the loser got = (1/4) * 80

The final answer is 20."
"As a florist, I understand the importance of meeting customer demands, especially when it comes to timely delivery. In this scenario, Sandra, the florist, has ordered a combination of flowers, and it's essential to determine the number of red roses she needs to receive by 5 pm to avoid losing her business.

Let's break down the information provided:

- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
- She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.

To find the number of white carnations, we can set up an equation using the information about the pink calla lilies:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Jan is 30 years old. To find Mark's current age, we need to consider his age two years ago. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 30 / 2 = 15. So, two years ago, Mark was 15 + 5 = 20 years old.

Since then, Mark has aged 2 years, so his current age is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Now, we know Mark's current age and the fact that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's age can be calculated as Mark's age + 2. 

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Jean's age = 22 + 2
Jean's age = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"In the context of track and field, a 4x400 meter relay is a classic event that requires a combination of speed, endurance, and strategy. As someone who appreciates the nuances of athletic performance, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's analyze the times for each runner on the less well-rounded team. The first runner's time is 60 seconds, followed by a 3-second decrease in time for each subsequent runner. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -3 seconds.

The times for the less well-rounded team are: 60, 57, 54, and 51 seconds.

To find the total time, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51. Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 4/2 * (60 + 51)
S = 2 * 111
S = 222 seconds

Now, let's compare this to the well-rounded team's time, which is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"When analyzing the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row, we can approach this problem from a combinatorial perspective.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (6). This results in a probability of 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (3/6 = 1/2) and then the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 1/2). Multiplying these probabilities together gives us (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: 25%"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mom's share by 2.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

To find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Mom's apples + Jenna's apples
Total apples = 20 + 10
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"As a rodent behaviorist, I've studied the distribution patterns of rodents in various environments. In this scenario, we're dealing with rats and hamsters, both common small mammal species. 

To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to first calculate the total number of straw pieces used for the rats. We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw, and a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw. The total straw used for these animals is 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70.

Since the total straw used for all animals is 160, the straw used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90.

Now, we know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. To find the number of straw pieces per cage, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3:

Straw pieces per cage = 90 / 3 = 30

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the straw pieces per cage by 6 to find the number of rats in each cage:

Number of rats in each cage = 30 / 6 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months. We can plug these values into the formula:

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict:

Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 
Total Revenue = 30x

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation:
Total Cost = 20x + 2x
Total Cost = 22x

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
400 = 30x - 22x
400 = 8x

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8:
x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the total cost of the expenses, we need to calculate the cost of the food and the rides separately and then add them to the cost of the tickets.

The cost of the tickets is given as $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and there are 2 rides. 

Cost of rides = 2 * $33
Cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can use the formula:

Total peaches = Number of hours * Number of peaches per hour

Given that John collects peaches for 3 hours and can collect 2 peaches per minute, we first need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute:

Total peaches = 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"As an expert in avian nutrition, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ducks.

To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, the ducks require 0.5 pounds of insects per day to maintain their nutritional needs.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To calculate the number of trees Tom has left, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over the 10-year period.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, resulting in a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees. However, he also chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Initially, Tom had 50 trees. Adding the net gain to the initial number of trees, we get:

50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3:

130 * 0.3 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

130 - 39 = 91 trees

The final answer is: 91"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the change Violetta will receive, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. The cost of a pencil is $1.20, and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. To find the cost of a pen, we simply add these two costs together.

Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
= $1.20 + $0.30
= $1.50

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we need to calculate the difference between the total amount of carrots available and the total amount distributed.

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds. To find the total amount distributed, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each receives:

Total amount distributed = 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds

Now, we subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available to find the amount that will not be used:

Amount not used = Total amount available - Total amount distributed
= 200 pounds - 80 pounds
= 120 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can use the principle of set theory. The total population is the sum of the number of men, women, and children. We know the number of men and women, so we can subtract their sum from the total population to find the number of children.

Let's calculate the number of children:

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. This can be represented as 20 + 3 * 20.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. This can be represented as 20 + 3 * 20 - 20.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is 20 + 3 * 20 + 20 - 20 = 60 + 40 = 100. Twice that number is 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month: 
20 + 3 * 20 + 20 - 20 + 200 = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"As a copy-editor, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total amount Mark makes in a week. 

First, we know that Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Let's denote the number of sentences for each publisher as 'x'. Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences, we can set up the equation:

x + x = 1000

Combine like terms:

2x = 1000

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 500

Now that we know each publisher receives 500 sentences, we can calculate the amount Mark earns from each publisher. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so the amount from Publisher A is:

500 sentences * 5 cents = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, the amount from Publisher B is:

2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we add the amounts from both publishers:

2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"

"To calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. There were 9 pens in each bag of blue and 6 pens in each bag of red.

To find the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens of each color:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens.

"To find the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we need to consider the average of the six tests. Since she can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then determine the required score for the sixth test.

Let's denote the sum of the first five test scores as S. We know the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

S = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
S = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, which is 71, we subtract it from the total score:
S - 71 = 438 - 71
S - 71 = 367

Now, we need to find the total score for six tests, which is the desired average multiplied by 6:
Total score = 93 * 6
Total score = 558

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the total score for six tests:
Required score = Total score - S
Required score = 558 - 367
Required score = 191

The final answer is 191."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first period and the second period.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. This can be calculated as 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is the sum of the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: 860"
"To calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to consider the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of cakes she bought on Monday as M, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday as T, and the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday as W.

We know that M = 4 (given).
T = 3M = 3(4) = 12 (since she bought three times the number of cakes on Monday)
W = 5T = 5(12) = 60 (since she bought five times the number of cakes on Tuesday)

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day:
Total = M + T + W = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. 

First, we need to find the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as x.

The total amount Sara needs to earn is $50 (jacket and shoes) - $10 (initial savings) = $40.

Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up the equation: 4x = 40.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 40 / 4.

x = 10

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's dive into the world of poultry farming and crack the code of the chicken egg production problem.

We're given that Jerry has a flock of chickens, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected is 42. We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and white chickens (w). We can express the relationship between the number of white chickens and red chickens as w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected can be represented by the equation: 3r + 5w = 42. Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. We also know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the number of customers on the first day. Let's represent the number of customers on the first day as 'x'. Then, the number of customers on the second day is 'x + 50'.

The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on the first and second days, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that this sum is equal to 250.

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day:

x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150

The number of customers on the third day is the total number of customers on the third day minus the total number of customers on the first two days:

500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

250"
"Let's dive into the problem of finding the amount of water in the small pool.

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water four minutes ago.

Since both pools have been leaking for 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool now as y gallons. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting 2x - 16 for 4y in the first equation: 2x - 16 = 2(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 2x - 32. This equation is true for all values of x, so we need to use the second equation to find the value of x.

Substituting x - 16 for y in the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 4x - 64. Adding 64 to both sides, we get 2x + 48 = 4x. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 48 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 24.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 24 - 16 = y, so y = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Now, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

Final answer: 44"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. To find the total amount she needs to pay, we need to calculate the additional amount she borrowed, which is 10% of $2000.

The formula for calculating the additional amount is:

Additional amount = 10% of $2000
= 0.10 * $2000
= $200

So, the total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months.

Total amount paid = $165 * 12
= $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can use basic arithmetic. 

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias by adding 7 to the number of roses.

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + 11
= 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we need to first determine their current ages.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Next, we can calculate Adrian's age, which is three times the age of Harriet: 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, Brianna's points as B, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Y = (1/2)N + 10
Y = (1/2)(68) + 10
Y = 34 + 10
Y = 44

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
B = N + 17
B = 68 + 17
B = 85

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85
= 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.
J = 251 - (N + Y + B)
J = 251 - 197
J = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles, we can use the following formula:

Time spent = (Number of crossword puzzles * Time per crossword puzzle) + (Number of sudoku puzzles * Time per sudoku puzzle)

Given that Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles, and it takes her 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time spent = (3 * 10) + (8 * 5)
Time spent = 30 + 40
Time spent = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the water tank contains 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

Since the collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left, we can calculate it as 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

Now, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

The number of geraniums is given as 90. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, the number of petunias can be calculated as:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"Advertising Budget Calculation

When calculating the total advertising expenditure for a company over two years, it's essential to consider the initial investment and the subsequent expenditure. In this scenario, the company initially spends $15,000 on advertising for a year. 

To determine the total amount spent in the second year, we need to calculate a third of the initial expenditure. This can be done by dividing the initial expenditure by 3.

Total Expenditure = Initial Expenditure + (Initial Expenditure / 3)
= $15,000 + ($15,000 / 3)
= $15,000 + $5,000
= $20,000

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.

The final answer is: $20,000"

"To calculate the total number of days for the round trip, we need to consider the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"Let's dive into the world of Pokémon card counting. As a Pokémon enthusiast and a keen observer of probability, I'd be happy to help James determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card.

To calculate the probability, we need to find the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards. 

Initially, James had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards. After buying 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

The total number of cards James has now is 30 (fire type) + 34 (grass type) + 32 (water type) = 96 cards.

The probability of picking a water type card is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards: (32 / 96) * 100.

To find the percentage, we can simplify the fraction: 32 / 96 = 1/3. Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage: (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 33%.

The final answer is 33."
"Let's break down the costs of Chad's meal:

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Next, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Then, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so 2 x $0.25 = $0.50, making the total $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. Finally, the upgrade for $3.00 brings the total to $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so subtracting this from the total, we get $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, we can divide 360 by their combined rate to find the total time it will take them to complete the puzzle.

360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. We need to find out how many were ready for harvest after two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 30% of 120
= 0.3 * 120
= 36

Now, let's find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm.

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36
= 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we can calculate 3/4 of 84.

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 3/4 * 84
= 0.75 * 84
= 63

To find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Number of watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63
= 21

"As a financial analyst specializing in automotive purchases, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved in buying a fleet of cars.

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the purchase price, tax, and registration fees.

The cost of the cars is calculated as follows:

12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. Assuming a 10% tax rate, the tax amount is:

0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Finally, we need to add the registration fees, which are $1,000 per car:

12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the cars, tax, and registration fees:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, Mark will pay a total of $276,000 for the fleet of cars.

"Let's dive into the world of shell collecting. As a beach enthusiast, I can tell you that the key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the number of shells collected by Kylie and Robert.

We know that Robert collects 20 shells, and Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Monday, we can simply add 5 to Robert's total:

Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 20 + 5
Kylie's shells on Monday = 25

Now, let's move on to Tuesday. We're told that Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. To find out how many shells she collects on Tuesday, we can multiply her Monday total by 2:

Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * Kylie's shells on Monday
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 * 25
Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 50

"Let's dive into the world of penguin behavior and solve this problem.

We know that there are 36 penguins initially. One-third of them jump in the ocean, which is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner, also 12 penguins. To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins.

36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12

Therefore, the number of penguins left sunbathing is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we can start by calculating the total number of tomatoes required per week. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

Steve's weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

His girlfriend's weekly consumption = 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Total weekly consumption = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption = 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by 3 to find the number of vines needed:

Number of vines = Total weekly consumption / 3 = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 = 21 vines/week

To account for the fact that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can multiply the number of vines by 2:

Number of vines = 2 * 21 vines/week = 42 vines/week

However, this calculation assumes that the vines will produce tomatoes at a constant rate. In reality, vine production can be affected by factors such as climate, soil quality, and pest management. To be on the safe side, it's best to round up to the nearest whole number to account for any potential variability.

Number of vines = 42 vines/week → 43 vines/week

Final answer: 43"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use the following calculation:

Number of slices needed = Total number of friends * Slices per friend

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices needed by 8 to find the number of pizzas:

Number of pizzas = Total number of slices needed / Slices per pizza
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's dive into the world of pen economics. As someone who appreciates the vibrant color yellow, I'll focus on the task at hand.

Ram starts with 25 pens and can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens. To find out how many full pens he can make, we can divide the total number of pens by 5.

25 pens ÷ 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is: 30"

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

We have three individuals: Jessa, Joan, and Mary. We know that Jessa is 20 years old. 

Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. We can calculate Mary's age as follows:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

To find the sum of their ages, we can add their ages together:
Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of their ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of their ages = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can calculate this as:

Number of students through exit A = 30% of 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

Remaining students = 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students:

Number of students through exit B = (3/5) * 700
= 3/5 * 700
= 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C:

Number of students through exit C = 700 - 420
= 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. We can represent this as an equation:

Let R = number of candies Robert has
Let J = number of candies John has

J = 2R

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

54 = 2R

To solve for R, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 ÷ 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' total from John's total:

J - J = 54 - 33
= 21

John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: 21"

Pandora will read 1 book from Dolly's book and 1 book from her own book, for a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we add the number of books each person will read: 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 6 books."
"To calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to consider the number of pages he writes and his writing speed.

Since Mike writes 30 pages per week and can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing as follows:

Time = Total pages * Time per page
Time = 30 pages * 6 minutes/page
Time = 180 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time = 180 minutes / 60
Time = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing per week.

We know that Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. This left Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Now, let's say Ginger gave Griffin x fries. After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 27 - 7.

x = 20

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"Let's dive into the world of aquariums and snails. As a snail enthusiast, I'd be delighted to help you solve this problem.

We have two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 28. This difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can denote the number of fish as 'x'. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

Now, let's set up the equation based on the given information:

32 - 4 = 2x
28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since we're looking for the number of fish in each aquarium, and both aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is:

There are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"As a makeup artist specializing in film and television productions, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.

To calculate the total amount paid, we need to consider the total hours worked and apply the discount. 

First, let's calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost without the discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $30,000: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we need to calculate the total cost of all the party supplies and then divide it by the number of people.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

The final answer is $32."
"To calculate the total cost of the onions, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Bags * Weight per Bag * Cost per Pound

Given:
Number of Bags = 4
Weight per Bag = 50 pounds
Cost per Pound = $1.50

Total Cost = 4 * 50 * $1.50
Total Cost = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister, and then find the difference in calories consumed.

Let's start by finding the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday and Tuesday. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

To find the difference in calories consumed, we subtract the calories consumed by her sister from the calories consumed by Sue:

Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: 5600"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we need to apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we subtract the number of apps deleted from the initial number of apps: 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps downloaded to the result: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rick's hunting expedition can be analyzed using basic arithmetic operations. We'll start by identifying the number of wolves and cougars he killed each day.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

To find the number of cougars he killed today, we subtract 3 from the number of cougars he killed last night: 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we add up the total number of animals Rick killed: 
- Wolves: 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
- Cougars: 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars
- Total number of animals Rick killed: 55 wolves + 27 cougars = 82 animals.

The final answer is: 82"
"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can use a simple mathematical equation. 

Bill's current floor is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

Let's represent Bill's starting floor as 'x'. The equation would be: 

4x + 6

Since Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can substitute x with 3:

4(3) + 6

First, multiply 4 and 3:
12 + 6

Now, add 12 and 6:
18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The final answer is 18."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each initially. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. To find the number of cows in each stall after the division, we can calculate the total number of cows in all 20 stalls and then divide by 20.

The total number of cows in all 20 stalls initially is:
10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
200 cows + 40 cows = 240 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
240 cows / 20 stalls = 12 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
12 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 96 cows

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"Let's calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank. We can break it down by coin type and add the values together.

First, we'll calculate the value of the coins:
- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 = $5

Next, we'll add the value of the dollar bills: $5 + $40 = $45

Brady has $45 in his piggy bank."
"As a forestry expert, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the weight of the redwood.

To find the total weight of the redwood, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites and subtract it from the total weight of the redwood.

First, we need to find the total weight of the redwood. Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, we can divide the total height of the tree (200 feet) by 10 to find the number of sections:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can multiply the total weight of the redwood by 0.30 (which is equivalent to 30%):

8000 pounds * 0.30 = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue, we get: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation to represent the number of apples Jamal has:

Let x be the number of apples Jamal has.
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Andrea has x + 8 apples.
We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation: x + 8 = 52.

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
x = 52 - 8
x = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can set up an equation to represent the number of bananas Jamal has:

Let y be the number of bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so y = x + 4.
We know x = 44, so we can substitute this value into the equation: y = 44 + 4.
y = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
y / 2 = 48 / 2
y / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

The total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies and then divide by 12, as 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following calculation:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62."
"Let's calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has. We know she initially had 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find the total number of marbles, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

Total marbles = Number of boxes * Number of marbles per box
Total marbles = 5 * 50
Total marbles = 250

Then, Maddison received 20 marbles from her friend. To find the new total, we add the marbles she received to the initial total.

New total = Initial total + Marbles received
New total = 250 + 20
New total = 270

Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, Ferdinand's yard as F, and Harry's yard as H.

We know that C = 6 (Chris has 6 trees).

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so H = 2F + 5 = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three variables: Carmen's money (C), Samantha's money (S), and Daisy's money (D). We know that:

1. C = $100
2. S = C + $25
3. D = S + $50

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for S: S = $100 + $25 = $125.

Now, substitute the value of S into the equation for D: D = $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money the girls have, we add up the amounts: C + S + D = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

The selling price of the house is $350,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. To find the total price of the house, we add the selling price and the total additional fees: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"As a financial analyst specializing in real estate transactions, I can break down the costs associated with selling a house. To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to consider the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

Transfer fees: 3% of the selling price = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of the selling price = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

The time to heat up the oil to 300 degrees is given as 20 minutes. Then, it takes 40% longer to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. 

First, we need to find 40% of 20 minutes. 
40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes

Now, we add this to the initial 20 minutes to get the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees.
Total time to heat up the oil = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

The time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil.
Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes

"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by finding the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information provided.

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20. To find their ages in 10 years, we need to consider the linear relationship between their ages.

Assuming their ages are x and y, we can write an equation: x + y = 20.

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's tackle this problem using algebraic equations. We're given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, let's substitute R = 6S into the second equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: 6"

"Let's dive into the world of reptilian populations and spot counts.

To determine the total number of spots, we need to first find the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park. To find the total number of spots, we can multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra and add it to the product of the number of mambas and the number of spots on each mamba.

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

Now, to find half the number of spots, we can divide the total number of spots by 2.

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To calculate the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game, we need to determine the total number of people attending the event.

"As a jewelry expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts. To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones and then divide it by the length of each bead.

The total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches, and the total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The space between the gemstones can be found by subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches ÷ (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

68"
"To calculate the total number of stories written, we need to consider the number of stories each child wrote in the first week and double it for the second week.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled it to 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled it to 80 stories in the second week.
Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled it to 120 stories in the second week.

Now, let's add the number of stories each child wrote in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can simply add 3 to his current age. 

Current age of Ann's brother = 2 * Ann's age = 2 * 9 = 18 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"Let's break down Kelly's coins to determine how much money she has. We know she has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, we need to calculate the total value of her quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we multiply the number of quarters by the value of each quarter: 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

Next, we calculate the total value of her dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, we multiply the number of dimes by the value of each dime: 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

Now, we add the total value of her quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money she has: 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she will have left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has: 145 - 55 = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we can start by finding the total number of stars. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so the total number of stars in these rows is 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

To find the number of rows, we divide 40 by 5, which is 40 / 5 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to consider the weight capacity of each truck and the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find the number of trucks needed, we can divide the total weight of the flagstones by the truck's capacity.

Let's calculate the number of trucks required:

Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Truck capacity
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
= 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"When calculating the time it takes for an object to cover a certain distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as follows:

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 30 miles/hour

Now, we can use the formula to find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. To find the number of medals Izzy has, we subtract 5 from 22:

Izzy's medals = 22 - 5
Izzy's medals = 17

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is the sum of their individual medals:

Total medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
Total medals = 22 + 17
Total medals = 39

Since the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together, we can set up the equation:

Total medals = 10 × (Ali's medals + Izzy's medals)
Total medals = 10 × 39
Total medals = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available and then divide them equally among the children.

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, resulting in a total of 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

The adults will receive 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars. To find the remaining chocolate bars, we subtract the number given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we divide the remaining 16 chocolate bars among the 8 children. This can be calculated as 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes she works by multiplying the hours by 60. 

Total minutes worked = 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works. 

Adjusted total minutes worked = 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can calculate her earnings by dividing the adjusted total minutes worked by 10 and multiplying by 5.

Earnings = (150 minutes / 10 minutes) * $5
Earnings = 15 * $5
Earnings = $75

The final answer is $75."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have the following information:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony get an extra point each, and Jim does not get an extra point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we add up the points of all three players to find the total points:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we need to calculate the total number of oranges washed by the sons. 

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washed 8 oranges. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old. Therefore, he washed 4 oranges.

In total, the sons washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Since Will bought 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges is 15 - 12 = 3.

The final answer is 3."
"To calculate the total count of activities Darren has done in the two days, we need to analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he increased the number of pushups by 20, decreased the number of squats by 10, and doubled the number of dumbbell presses.

Let's calculate the number of each activity on both days:

Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg ÷ 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates sold. 

Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. 

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can calculate the difference by subtracting the total crates sold from the target.

Difference = Target - Total crates sold
= 120 - 65
= 55

Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"The problem can be solved by calculating the total amount of money Carmen spent on the desk. Since the bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, we can use an arithmetic sequence to find the final cost.

Let's denote the first bid as $200 and the common difference as $50. The number of bids made by Carmen is 3 (after each of the 3 other people). 

The final bid can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: 

an = a1 + (n-1)d

where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the number of terms, and d is the common difference.

In this case, a1 = $200, n = 4 (since Carmen bids 3 times after the other 3 people), and d = $50.

an = 200 + (4-1)50
an = 200 + 150
an = 350

However, this is the final bid, not the total cost. To find the total cost, we need to add the initial bid of $200 to the final bid of $350.

Total cost = Initial bid + Final bid
Total cost = $200 + $350
Total cost = $550

The final answer is: $550"
"As a transportation expert, I can break down the problem into manageable components to calculate the total cost of driving for John.

To determine the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. Since John's work is 30 miles away and he goes there and back each day, the daily round-trip distance is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. 

Since John goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 

Now, we multiply the weekly miles driven by the number of weeks in a year (50 weeks) to get the total miles driven per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year.

The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference between his desired exercise time and the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Desired exercise time = 2 x (Monday's exercise time + Sunday's exercise time)
= 2 x (16 + 23)
= 2 x 39
= 78 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, he needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday.

The final answer is: 78"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the pattern of page placement. 

When folding a tabloid, each side has an equal number of pages. Since the pages are arranged in pairs, we can pair them up. 

There are 32 pages in total, so we can pair them up as follows: (1-2), (3-4), (5-6), ..., (31-32). 

Since each pair consists of two pages, we can divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the number of pairs. 

32 ÷ 2 = 16 

Since each pair consists of two pages, we multiply the number of pairs by 2 to find the total number of pages. 

16 × 2 = 32 

However, this counts each pair twice, so we need to divide the result by 2 again. 

32 ÷ 2 = 16 

Therefore, 16 pairs of pages are used in a 32-page tabloid.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's break down Annika's expenses step by step.

Annika initially had $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. This can be represented as:

$50 - (1/2) × $50 = $50 - $25 = $25

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. To find the remaining amount, we subtract this from the previous result:

$25 - $10 = $15

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to analyze the given information.

Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is 2 * 45 = 90.

We know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200. So, the number of books sold in the second year is 200 - 90 = 110.

Since each book sells at 20$, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"

So, John lost to 4 people."
"As a bakery management expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon.

First, we need to calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales. Since two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Now, we subtract the morning sales from the total to find the remaining loaves:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate this as:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

As the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in each is:

10 / 2 = 5 loaves

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to analyze the rate at which Joey loses weight.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weight loss rate as follows:

Weight loss rate = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight loss rate = 2 pounds per week

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight, we can divide the total weight by Sandy's weight loss rate:

Number of weeks = Total weight / Weight loss rate
Number of weeks = 8 pounds / 2 pounds per week
Number of weeks = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey."

"The Lots-of-Limbs Serum: A Mathematical Analysis

As a renowned expert in the field of bio-mathematical modeling, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of extra arms as A and the number of extra legs as L. We know that the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, so the number of extra arms after 15 days can be calculated as:

A = 15 / 3 = 5

Similarly, the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so the number of extra legs after 15 days can be calculated as:

L = 15 / 5 = 3

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs:

Total new limbs = A + L = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs after 15 days.

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits and suitcases: 6 business suits at $100 each is 6 * $100 = $600, and 3 suitcases at $50 each is 3 * $50 = $150. The total cost of these items is $600 + $150 = $750.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the flight ticket. Since it costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, we can express this as 5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items purchased so far: $750 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

"Egg-cellent question! As a math enthusiast, I'd be delighted to crack open the problem for you.

To determine the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption and then multiply it by 7.

Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so their total daily egg consumption is 3 x 3 = 9 eggs. This accounts for 3/5 of the family's daily egg consumption.

The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, contributing 2 x 2 = 4 eggs to the daily total. This accounts for 2/5 of the family's daily egg consumption.

To find the total daily egg consumption, we add the contributions from both groups: 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: 91"

"Let's dive into the world of population dynamics and age relationships. As someone who appreciates the vibrant hue of yellow, I find the interplay between ages and populations fascinating.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Find Noah's current age: Since Cera is 46 years old now, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, we can find Noah's current age by adding 6 to Cera's age.

Noah's current age = Cera's current age + 6
Noah's current age = 46 + 6
Noah's current age = 52

2. Find the population of Chile six years ago: The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's current age
Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * 52
Population of Chile six years ago = 156,000

3. Find the current population of Chile: Since the population of Chile six years ago was half of the current population, we can find the current population by multiplying the population six years ago by 2.

Current population of Chile = Population of Chile six years ago * 2
Current population of Chile = 156,000 * 2
Current population of Chile = 312,000

"In the context of football team management, understanding the relationship between offense, defense, and special teams is crucial for strategic planning. As a football strategist, I'd like to break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so the total number of people in these families is 2 x 6 = 12. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so the total number of people in these families is 3 x 4 = 12. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, so we need to subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

Additionally, 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. We need to subtract these 2 people from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total weight of marbles, we need to calculate the total number of marbles first. Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the dimensions of the pool: Length = 6 feet, Width = 4 feet, and Depth = 5 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool would be:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Since there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3.

Number of girls = 3 * 30
Number of girls = 90

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we can multiply the number of boys by 1/10.

Number of nongendered children = 1/10 * 30
Number of nongendered children = 3

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children
Total number of children = 30 + 90 + 3
Total number of children = 123

The total number of children in the classroom is 123."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there were initially 25 men and 15 women at the party. The total number of people at the party is the sum of men and women, which is 25 + 15 = 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of men who left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

Now, we know that 3 men and 10 people in total left the party. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8

"To determine the total number of boxes needed, we need to calculate the total number of pencils first. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Additionally, Meg has 46 pencils.

Let's calculate the total number of pencils: 26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

72 ÷ 24 = 3

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the cooling effect and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Let's analyze the situation. We know that 5 people traded their old records for new ones, and the exchange rate is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record received, 2 old records were given up.

To find the total number of old records traded, we can multiply the number of new records received by 2. Since 5 people received 7 new records, the total number of old records traded is:

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the company has 100 employees in total. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which can be calculated as:

Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
= 2/5 * 100
= 40

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is:

Salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400
= $2400

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is:

Total amount for junior programmers = Number of junior programmers * Salary of a junior programmer
= 40 * $2000
= $80,000

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is:

Total amount for senior programmers = Number of senior programmers * Salary of a senior programmer
= 60 * $2400
= $144,000

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

Total amount = Total amount for junior programmers + Total amount for senior programmers
= $80,000 + $144,000
= $224,000

The final answer is: $224,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple addition and subtraction problem involving the number of people getting on and off a bus.

Initially, we know that 5 people got on the bus at the first stop. Then, at the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. To find the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we need to consider the net change in the number of people on the bus.

The net change in the number of people on the bus is the difference between the number of people who got on and the number who got off. At the second stop, 8 people got on and 7 got off, resulting in a net gain of 1 person.

Since we know that 20 people were heading to the third stop, and we've accounted for the net gain of 1 person, we can set up the equation:

Initial number of people on the bus + net gain = 20

Let's represent the initial number of people on the bus as x. We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, so the initial number of people on the bus is x = 5. However, we also need to account for the net gain of 1 person at the second stop. Since 8 people got on and 7 got off, the net gain is 1, so we can represent the total number of people on the bus as x + 1.

Now, we can set up the equation:

x + 1 = 20

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

So, the initial number of people on the bus was 19. Since 5 people got on at the first stop, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 19 + 5 = 24.

The final answer is: 24"
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, let's analyze the sequence of events:

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he passes 14 out to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. After that, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. Finally, he eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 36 - 3 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more. This can be represented as:

Initial lollipops + Additional lollipops = Total lollipops
7 + 10 = 17

Next, we subtract the 3 lollipops Erin gives to Ella:

Total lollipops - Lollipops given away = Lollipops left
17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards they received and the discount applied.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

Final Answer: The final answer is $72."
"As a financial analyst specializing in tax planning and compensation, I'd be happy to help you compare the net pay of two job offers.

To determine which job Nick will make more, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay, Job B has a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can calculate 40% of the total number of castles and then divide that result by 2.

40% of 220 castles = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final Answer: The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100. However, since we are looking for the cost difference, we can express this as a positive value by taking the absolute difference: |$3,350 - $3,450| = $100.

The final answer is $100."
"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and divide it by 4.

The total number of guns is the sum of the guns each person has: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

Now, we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find the number of guns each person would have:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can multiply the number of batches of suckers by the amount of sugar required per batch and add the amount of sugar needed for the batch of fudge.

The amount of sugar needed for suckers is 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.
The amount of sugar needed for fudge is 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we can use the concept of percentage change. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price: 
50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
Value after the first year: $8 + $4 = $12

Then, we calculate the decrease in the second year: 
25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
Value after the second year: $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:
8 shares * $9 per share = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L, the number Thomas ate as T, and the number John ate as J.

We know that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so L = 2.

We also know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so T = 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Finally, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so J = T/2 = 6/2 = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: J - L = 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 200 students divided into three groups. Two of the groups are equal in size, and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in size, each of them has 2x students.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of students:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's use 'c' to represent the number of cows and '2c' to represent the number of chickens.

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can set up the equation:

c + 2c = 60

Combine like terms:

3c = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

c = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:

2c = 2(20) = 40 chickens

To find the total number of legs, we need to multiply the number of cows and chickens by their respective leg counts:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls after each week is as follows:
- Week 1: 3
- Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4
- Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5
- Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6

Since Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught, he loses 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds, and the green toad also weighs 50 pounds. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird) = 200 pounds.

"As a sports analytics expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Tyson's training regimen.

To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to first determine the new daily distance. Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than his original 5000 meters. This can be calculated as:

New daily distance = Original daily distance + (Original daily distance * 1/5)
= 5000 + (5000 * 1/5)
= 5000 + 1000
= 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June can be calculated as:

Total distance = New daily distance * Number of days
= 6000 * 30
= 180,000 meters

Therefore, Tyson will cover a total distance of 180,000 meters in June.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the prices of three juice boxes: Juice Box A, Juice Box B, and Juice Box C. We know that Juice Box A costs $4. 

Since Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, we can calculate its price as follows:

Juice Box B = Juice Box A + $5
Juice Box B = $4 + $5
Juice Box B = $9

Now, we are asked to find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B. We know that Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A:

Juice Box C = Juice Box A + $7
Juice Box C = $4 + $7
Juice Box C = $11

To find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is:
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"When calculating the total cost of the shirts after a 40% discount, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price)

In this case, the original price of one shirt is $30, and the discount percentage is 40% or 0.4.

Total Cost = $30 - (0.4 * $30)
Total Cost = $30 - $12
Total Cost = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total Cost for 2 shirts = $18 * 2
Total Cost for 2 shirts = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to find the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to consider the duration of each activity.

The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the cooking class on Tuesday is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, which is 3 hours. So, the museum tour on Thursday is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she requires twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can calculate the total number of pots needed as follows:

Number of pots for daisies = 30
Number of pots for roses = 2 * 30 = 60
Total number of pots needed = 30 + 60 = 90

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had:

100 - 90 = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."

"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can use the given information. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as S, the height of the second tree as S + 5, and the height of the tallest tree as T.

We know that S = 6 feet. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is S + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is S + (S + 5) = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so T = 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. Additionally, she wants to give each of her friends $5 in arcade tokens, so the total cost for arcade tokens is $5 * number of friends.

Let's denote the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5x (arcade tokens). We know that the total cost should not exceed her budget of $90. So, we can set up the inequality:

$5 + $20 + $5x ≤ $90

Combine like terms:

$25 + $5x ≤ $90

Subtract $25 from both sides:

$5x ≤ $65

Divide both sides by $5:

x ≤ 13

Since we can't have a fraction of a friend, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Morgan can invite 13 friends to her party.

The final answer is 13."
"Let's break down Marisa's daily expenses and savings.

Marisa's daily pocket money is $5. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. To find the total cost of lollipops, we multiply the number of lollipops by the cost of each lollipop:

4 lollipops * $0.25 = $1

Since Marisa saves the change, we subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:

$5 (daily pocket money) - $1 (total cost of lollipops) = $4

So, Marisa saves $4 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $4"
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.

Let's calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:

$2 ÷ $1.5 = 1.33 pounds

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the calculation yields a precise value, so we can provide the exact answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable S, which represents the son's age.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. To find the distance from the third city to the first city, we subtract 50 from the sum of the other two distances:

Distance from third city to first city = 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles

The total distance traveled in one trip is the sum of the individual distances:

Total distance = 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is:

Total distance per day = 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in a day by the service interval:

Number of days between services = Total distance per day / Service interval
= 900 miles/day ÷ 18,000 miles
= 0.05 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

Number of hours between services = 0.05 days * 24 hours/day
= 1.2 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Number of minutes between services = 1.2 hours * 60 minutes/hour
= 72 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 72 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total amount of stuffing needed, we need to find the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and add them together.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total time taken for John's trip, we need to break it down into three parts: the trip to his friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and he drives at a speed of 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate the time taken for this part of the trip:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

The detour adds 10 miles to the trip, but since the speed remains the same, the time taken for the detour is:

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

For the return trip, John covers a distance of 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add up the times for each part of the trip to find the total time taken:

Total time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Let's break it down step by step:

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

So, there were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to consider the given information. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can represent the number of boys as 2x and the number of girls as x. We know that the number of girls is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x = 6

To find the number of boys, we can multiply the number of girls by 2:

Number of boys = 2x
Number of boys = 2(6)
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Jane has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, for a total of 33 points. To meet the requirement of at least 42 points, we can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

where x represents the points Jane needs on the third test.

Subtracting 33 from both sides of the inequality gives us:

x ≥ 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"Let's analyze the situation step by step. We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. 

We are given that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. This is a straightforward piece of information. 

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, four times that many is 4 * 3 = 12. Minus 5 is 12 - 5 = 7. So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, three times that many is 3 * 7 = 21. So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out. 

50 (total) - 3 (refusing to wear masks) - 7 (shoplifting) - 21 (physical violence) = 19

Therefore, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons.

Final answer: 19"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to set up an equation.

Let's say Sara had x points before. Then, Erin had 3x points. Since Erin scored 14 points, we can set up the equation:

3x = 14

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Let's assume Sara had 4 points before.

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before, we can multiply Sara's points by 3:

Erin's points before = 3 * 4
Erin's points before = 12

The correct answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of senior gifts, we need to consider the costs associated with picture frames, pins, and cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching the logo. This can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24 per frame

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to calculate the cost of pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. The total cost for pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12. The total cost for cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

To find the total cost of senior gifts, we add the costs of picture frames, pins, and cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"When it comes to calculating the cost of a DIY hand-painted wallpaper, it's essential to consider the original cost and the discount. In this case, the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. To find the cost after the 20% discount, we can use the following formula:

Cost after discount = Original cost - (Original cost * Discount percentage)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Cost after discount = $400 - ($400 * 0.20)
= $400 - $80
= $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The shoe store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday. On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, 6 people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50

The final answer is: 50"
"Let's break down the dance practice hours for Hallie:

Hallie has dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. On Saturdays, she has practice that lasts twice as long as Tuesday's night class. To find the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to add the hours for each day.

Saturday: 2 hours (twice as long as Tuesday's night class)

Total hours per week = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the company bought $400,000 worth of equipment and 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. To find the total amount spent on functioning pieces, we need to first find the total number of pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. Since the total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000, the amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The amount spent on functioning pieces can be represented as:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = Total amount spent on all pieces - Amount spent on faulty pieces
= $400,000 - 0.4x

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 0.6 * 400,000

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

x = 0.6 * 400,000 / 0.6
x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = $400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to consider the milk production from both halves of her sheep.

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg of milk from the other half, we can calculate the total milk production as follows:

Total milk production = (1 kg * 15 sheep) + (2 kg * 15 sheep)
Total milk production = 15 kg + 30 kg
Total milk production = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

Final Answer: The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Mrs. Sherman started with a dozen (12) bread rolls. A dozen is equal to 12. 

Next, she fed 6 of the rolls to her children. To find the number of rolls left, we subtract 6 from 12.

12 - 6 = 6

Now, we know that the remaining 6 rolls were broken into 8 pieces each. To find the total number of pieces, we multiply 6 (the number of rolls) by 8 (the number of pieces per roll).

6 * 8 = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 40 pupils in the class. Half of the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 pupils.

The remaining pupils are 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so the number of pupils who like green is 20 / 4 = 5.

To find the number of pupils who like yellow, we subtract the pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow.

The final answer is 15."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked, and she earned $56. To find out how many apples she picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount earned ($56) by the price per apple ($4).

$56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples

Since Lucy picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, and she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as follows:

12 (Tuesday) × 2 = 24 apples

Now, we can add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of apples picked.

14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples

The total number of apples picked over the three days is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many cookies are left for Rachel, we need to subtract the number of cookies she initially had, the number of cookies Janet gave her, and the number of cookies her brother ate.

Initial cookies: 23
Cookies from Janet: 42
Cookies eaten by brother: 44

Total cookies: 23 + 42 = 65
Cookies left after Janet gave some: 65 - 42 = 23
Cookies left after brother ate some: 23 - 44 = -21

Since you can't have a negative number of cookies, it means that Rachel doesn't have any cookies left.

"To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = $3,650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ $802.19

So, Karan needs to pay approximately $802.19 per month.

The final answer is: $802.19"
"To calculate the distance hiked by Cho and Chloe, we need to multiply their respective speeds by the time they hiked.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. We can calculate the distance using the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. We can calculate the distance using the same formula:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To calculate the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to add the amount of silver and gold they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

Final answer: 350"
"As a lemonade stand expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to determine the profit per hour. 

First, let's calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with her initial investment. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she buys enough supplies for 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Next, we need to calculate her total revenue. Since she sells each cup for $1, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Now, let's calculate her total cost. We know she spends $18 on supplies.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find her profit per hour, we need to divide her total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we need to calculate the total number of people performing. Since the choir has 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls, we can calculate the number of girls as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

However, the choir decides to perform with just the female members, so we only consider the 26 girls. Unfortunately, half of the people performing can't make it to the show due to the bus breakdown. To find the number of people who can perform, we need to subtract half of the total number of people performing from the total number of girls. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

So, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30.

In this case, Dasha saves $30 - $18 = $12.

Since we are looking for the amount David saves, the answer is $12.

"Let's break down the costs to determine the savings from cancelling the cable package.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. The discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - (20% of $10) = $10 - $2 = $8 per month. Since there are two services, the total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package: $60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42 per month.

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"

"To calculate the total number of bugs, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we are told that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

First, let's calculate the energy used in 8 hours a day:
Energy used in 8 hours a day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Next, we'll calculate the energy used in 3 hours a day:
Energy used in 3 hours a day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Now, we'll find the energy saved per day by subtracting the energy used in 3 hours from the energy used in 8 hours:
Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert the energy saved per day to kilowatts, we'll divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Finally, we'll calculate the energy saved in 30 days:
Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the average number of stripes, we need to add up the total number of stripes and divide by the number of zebras.

The first two zebras have 17 stripes each, so together they have 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.
The third zebra has 36 stripes.
The fourth zebra has half the number of stripes of the third zebra, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

Now, let's add up the total number of stripes: 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.

The average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"To determine the total cost of the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can represent the number of corns as 2 * 40 = 80.

However, it's mentioned that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. This implies that the number of corns he bought is 40 - 40 = 0. Since he already had 0 corns, the number of corns remains 0.

Now, we can find the total number of cannolis by adding the initial number of cannolis (40) to the number of cannolis bought (60). This gives us 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 0 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 100.

Final answer: 100"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to consider the steps completed before the jog and the remaining steps.

Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. This totals 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since Elliott aimed to take 10,000 steps in total and had 2,000 steps left after the jog, we can calculate the steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

The final answer is: 8,000"
"To determine how many minutes it will take Toby to finish the book, we can use the formula:

Time = Total words / Reading rate

Given that the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words is:

Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute. Plugging in the values, we get:

Time = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Since Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 60 - 30 = 30 minutes early.

The final answer is 30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This means the total amount paid in May is:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 
1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. 
So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"Let's break down Sally's expenses to determine how much money she has left.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the taffy. The sale is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for every 2 pounds, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. Since Sally bought 2 pounds, we can calculate the cost as follows:

Cost of 2 pounds of taffy = (1 pound * $3) + (1 pound * $1.50) = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, we add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells and the 4 magnets:

Total cost = $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7

Sally started with $10, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:

Money left = $10 - $7 = $3

The final answer is $3."
"To calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, we need to consider the cost of the two packages and the finale firework.

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the total cost of the two packages, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can use the following calculation:

Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find the number of dozens:

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two sets. Since 5% of the candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 2.5% of the candles are more dangerous and will explode, we can assume that these two defects are independent events.

The probability of a candle smelling like wet dog is 5% or 0.05, and the probability of a candle exploding is 2.5% or 0.025. To find the probability of a candle having both defects, we multiply the probabilities:

0.05 x 0.025 = 0.00125

Now, we can multiply this probability by the total number of candles (50,000) to find the expected number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:

0.00125 x 50,000 = 62.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a candle, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is approximately 62.

Final answer: 62"
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to find the discount amount for each blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses.

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples from the average trees as z.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30. We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathers y = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3y = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + y + 3y = 3x + 4y. We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 4y = 500 - z

Since Joanne gathers z apples from the average trees, her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

We can substitute x = 30 and y = 15 into the equation:

3(30) + 4(15) = 500 - z
90 + 60 = 500 - z
150 = 500 - z
z = 500 - 150
z = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"Let's dive into the world of camel and dromedary populations. As a camel expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that the total number of heads is 180 and the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can set up the following equations:

Let c be the number of camels and d be the number of dromedaries.

We know that the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries, so we can write the equation:

c + d = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is the sum of twice the number of camels (since each camel has two humps) and the number of dromedaries (since each dromedary has one hump). This gives us the equation:

2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into one of the original equations:

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
" locker sizes are a fascinating topic in the realm of spatial geometry. As someone who appreciates the vibrant hue of yellow, I find the relationships between locker sizes to be particularly intriguing.

To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can start by analyzing the given information. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. We can use this information to find Zack's locker size.

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
= 4 * 5 cubic inches
= 20 cubic inches

Now that we have Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size, which is half as big as Zack's locker.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
= 2 * 20 cubic inches
= 40 cubic inches

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. He then received $4000 from the first bank and twice as much ($8000) from the second bank. To find the total amount of capital he has now, we need to add these amounts together.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Final answer: $17000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, we have 50 cats on the rock. Four boats come and carry away 5 cats each. To find the total number of cats carried away, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carries: 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

Now, we subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats: 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining cats run after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18 cats.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into three parts:

The first 6 months at $8 per month is equivalent to 6 * $8 = $48. The next 8 months at $12 per month is equivalent to 8 * $12 = $96. The last 8 months at $14 per month is equivalent to 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's represent the original price of the tattered jeans as x. Then, the original price of the jogger jeans is x - 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3) * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(2/3) * x + 4 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 6

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

Now that we know the original price of the tattered jeans is $3, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:

Original price of jogger jeans = x - 6
= 3 - 6
= -3

However, since the price cannot be negative, we re-evaluate our initial assumption. Let's re-examine the problem.

If the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and Cole saved a total of $6, it's possible that the original price of the jogger jeans is actually $6. In this case, the original price of the tattered jeans would be $12.

"As a transportation expert, I can help you calculate the total capacity of the vehicles.

To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"Bird Feeder Analysis: A Study on Attraction Rates

As a renowned ornithologist specializing in bird behavior and ecology, I have conducted extensive research on bird feeder dynamics. In this analysis, I will apply my knowledge to determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden.

To calculate the total number of birds, we need to consider the attraction rates of both store-bought and homemade bird feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 × 20 = 60.

The homemade bird feeders, on the other hand, attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, resulting in an attraction rate of 20 + 10 = 30 birds per feeder. Since Lillian builds 3 of these feeders, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 × 30 = 90.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden by adding the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: 150"
"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost as $4 + (25% of $4), which is $4 + $1 = $5. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $50, and each card is sold for $1.5.

The equation to represent the situation is:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying the fractions and the price per card:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50
(2/3)x * 1.5 = $50
(2 * 1.5) / 3 * x = $50
2.5x / 3 = $50

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to isolate x:

2.5x = $150

Finally, divide both sides by 2.5:

x = $150 / 2.5
x = 60

Therefore, Kenny started with 60 cards.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can use the concept of total demand and supply. The caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, which is equivalent to 36 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.

Let's calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests to have two hotdogs:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, there was a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

To find the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can subtract the number of guests who received two hotdogs from the total number of guests:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

Therefore, 22 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in each name separately and then add them together.

Indras' name has 6 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and adding 4 to that gives us 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"As a seasoned expert in retail mathematics, I'd be delighted to help Charlotte with her order.

To calculate the total cost of her order, we need to apply a 20% discount to the total cost of the items. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, we'll calculate the 20% discount:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we'll subtract the discount from the total cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"A delightful problem involving a series of dragon-slaying princes. As a dragon-slaying expert, I'll break down the information step by step.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword.
2. Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be represented as 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter, armed with a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be calculated as 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, relied on a nail file to slay dragons. He slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. This can be calculated as 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can divide the total amount of gas (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5) to find out how many gallons each container holds. Then, we can multiply that amount by 1/4 to find out how many gallons Josey needed.

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can multiply 3 gallons by 8 to find out how many pints Josey needed.

3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 24 pints of gasoline."
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how much money George spent on chips and candy bars combined. Since he spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

We know that George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20

Since the remaining lollipops were shared equally among 4 friends, we divide the remaining lollipops by 4.

Lollipops per friend = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom had from the total weight of the cake.

Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 / 8 = 2.5 ounces. However, since Rory and her mom each had a piece, we need to subtract 2 pieces from the total weight.

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Number of pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2
Weight of the remaining cake = 18 ounces

The remaining cake weighs 18 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people. 

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Now, we'll divide the total oranges by the total number of people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends): 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Therefore, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"To calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to consider the total cost of the ingredients and the number of servings.

The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00
The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings:

Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings
= $12.00 / 6
= $2.00

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time difference between their travel times.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as B. We know that B = 4W (since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel).

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation: B = W - 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get: 4W = W - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3W = 5.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: W = 5/3.

Now that we know the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater: B = 4W = 4(5/3) = 20/3.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to subtract the time it takes for her to get to the theater from the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater: 5 - (20/3) = 5 - 20/3 = (15 - 20)/3 = -5/3.

Since we can't have a negative time, we can convert this to a more meaningful answer. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and then round it to the nearest whole number. 

Converting -5/3 to a decimal, we get -1.67. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get -2.

However, since we can't have a negative number of minutes, we can re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 20/3 minutes to get to the theater. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 20/3 + 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Converting 20/3 to a decimal, we get 6.67. Adding 5 to this, we get 11.67. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we can round this to the nearest whole number. Rounding 11.67 to the nearest whole number, we get 12.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes due to baking and cooling.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. When Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the temperature increase is:

Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

However, when Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. This means the cooling rate is 0.2 degrees/minute. To find the total cooling effect, we need to calculate the cooling effect for 30 minutes:

Cooling time = 30 minutes
Cooling rate = 0.2 degrees/minute
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:

Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"As a sports analytics expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote Jon's swim time as S, bike time as B, and run time as R. We know that S = 40 minutes, B = 80 minutes, and R = 50 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so James' swim time is 0.9S. We can calculate this as 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so James' bike time is S + 5 = 40 + 5 = 45 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James' total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time. Jon's total time is S + B + R = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.

Since James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times, we can set up the equation: 0.9S + 45 + R = 180.

We already know that R = 50 minutes. Substituting this value into the equation, we get 0.9S + 45 + 50 = 180.

Simplifying the equation, we get 0.9S + 95 = 180. Subtracting 95 from both sides, we get 0.9S = 85. Dividing both sides by 0.9, we get S = 95.

However, we are asked to find James' run time, not Jon's swim time. We know that James' swim time is 36 minutes, and we can find his run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time: 180 - 36 - 45 = 99 minutes.

The final answer is 99."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, we know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long. We convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes ÷ 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total distance the horse runs, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. 

Time = 30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.5 hours

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 MPH * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay eaten is:
Hay eaten = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Hay eaten = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Hay eaten * $3 per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = $30 - $24

"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide it by the number of eggs per tray.

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass needs 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses as 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Now, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays: 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"

The salesman initially bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them at a flash sale on Monday for $20 each, generating $340 in revenue. The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. 

Let's calculate the revenue from the remaining sneakers: 
Number of sneakers left = 48 - 17 = 31
Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25 = 31 * $25 = $775

Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, which are worth $800 each. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, which are worth $1200 each. To find the total value of her jewels, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she has left: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires. The value of the sapphires she has left is 5 * $800 = $4000.

Next, let's calculate the value of the rubies she received: 2 rubies * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is $4000 (sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: 35%"
"As a farm management expert, I can help you determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed.

To calculate the total weight of the feed, we need to add the weight of each item together. 

The weight of the sugar cubes is 2 pounds, carrots are 48 pounds, hay is 3150 pounds, and oats are 1300 pounds. 

Total weight of feed = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4400 pounds

Now, we need to divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips. 

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As a recycling expert, I can help you calculate Grayson's earnings from recycling cans and bottles. To determine her total earnings in a month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

Total earnings per week is 6 + 15 = 21 cents.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, her total earnings in a month is 21 * 4 = 84 cents.

The final answer is 84."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find Toni's plants, we can calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total.

60% of 10 = 0.6 * 10 = 6

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 6
= 10 + 6
= 16

Now, we know Toni has 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. To find Shondra's plants, we subtract 7 from Toni's total.

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
= 16 - 7
= 9

The final answer is: 9"

"When calculating the tip for Ashley's pizza delivery, we need to determine 1/5 of the cost of the pizza. 

The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of this amount, we can multiply the cost by 1/5 or divide by 5.

Tip = $15 ÷ 5
Tip = $3

Since Ashley wants to give a tip equal to 1/5 of the cost of the pizza, the total amount she should give the delivery man is the cost of the pizza plus the tip.

Total amount = $15 + $3
Total amount = $18

The final answer is: $18"
"Let's analyze Finley's movements in the 100-meter race. We can break it down step by step:

Finley started in 1st place and fell back 5 spots, so she was in 6th place. This is a common mistake in racing, as runners often lose ground due to fatigue or misjudging the competition.

Next, Finley moved ahead 2 spots, which would put her in 4th place. However, she then fell behind 3 spots, resulting in a net loss of 1 spot. This is a common phenomenon in racing, where runners may struggle to regain lost ground.

Finally, Finley jumped ahead 1 spot, which would put her in 3rd place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 3rd place.

"As a math enthusiast, I'd be happy to help Miss Maria with her card distribution problem.

To find the total number of cards Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards separately.

Basketball cards: 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 cards
Baseball cards: 5 boxes * 40 cards per box = 200 cards

Total cards: 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300 cards.

Since each student got 10 cards, we can divide the remaining cards by 10 to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.

The final answer is 30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost of the apples they bought and subtract the discount.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.45 = $9.
Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 x 0.50 = $10.
Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is 10% of 10 = 0.10 x 10 = $1.
Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total.
$9 - $8 = $1.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs, which is equivalent to 10 individual shoes (since each pair consists of 2 shoes). So, the total number of shoes he has after Monday is 200 + 10 = 210.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is equivalent to 30 individual shoes. Adding this to the previous total, we get 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

Finally, on Friday, he gains 30 more pairs, which is equivalent to 60 individual shoes. Adding this to the previous total, we get 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

However, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. To find the total number of shoes he has left, we subtract 180 from 300: 300 - 180 = 120.

"To determine the number of pencils left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in 2 months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Now, we subtract the used pencils from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils to find the pencils left at the end of the year: (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

The number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is x. Since Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, and he gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, we can set up the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can start by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

Final Answer: The final answer is 6."
"When calculating the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to consider the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each measuring 6 inches, we first convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is equivalent to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we divide the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10\%}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. Let's say the total number of students is x. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We can set up the equation (1/4)x = 20 and solve for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.

Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, we can calculate the number of yellow tubes by multiplying the number of yellow tubes Ben has by 3. This gives us 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the number of blue tubes and yellow tubes together: 2 + 9 = 11.

Therefore, Jasper has a total of 11 tubes of paint.

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate the difference in their song capacities. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we can express this as:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player. We can do this by subtracting Luri's songs from the maximum capacity of Gabriel's player:

Gabriel's remaining capacity = 100 - 60
Gabriel's remaining capacity = 40

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 40.

"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We know that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes. This relationship can be expressed as:

h = 3s - 20

We are given that her shoes cost $80, so we can substitute s = 80 into the equation:

h = 3(80) - 20
h = 240 - 20
h = 220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, we can assume the average height of the bottom layer is 64"" (as the 10th girl is 60"" tall, which is the shortest).

The bottom layer has 4 girls, so the total height of this layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let x be the number of guests. The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food cost), while the cost of the second venue is $25x (per guest charge). Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

Therefore, the number of guests required for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

Final Answer: The final answer is 10."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43. Let's use variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let x be the number of insects Bodhi found. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.

Finally, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts. To find the total number of gifts, we add these to the previous total: 16 + 10 = 26.

Therefore, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the length of the couch, we can use the given information. The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, making it 8 feet wide. 

Since the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of couch = 2 * width of rug + 2
= 2 * 8 + 2
= 16 + 2
= 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total, 2 of which were strawberry. We also know she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum. 

First, let's find the total cost of the grape and green apple gum. The cost of the grape gum is $2, and the cost of the green apple gum is half of that, which is $2 / 2 = $1. The total cost of these two is $2 + $1 = $3.

Since Suzie spent a total of $7, the amount she spent on strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of strawberry gum by the number of packs, which is $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"The art of popsicle stick production! As a seasoned expert in the field of woodworking and popsicle stick manufacturing, I'm delighted to help Frederick optimize his lumber purchase.

To determine the most cost-effective option, we need to calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber. Let's crunch some numbers!

For 2 x 4 lumber:
Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

For 2 x 8 lumber:
Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

As we can see, the 2 x 8 lumber is the clear winner in terms of cost per stick. Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make with his budget of $24.

Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4
Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600, which can be achieved by purchasing 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber.

The final answer is: 1600"

"As a transportation expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the cost savings of buying a weekly bus pass.

To determine the total weekly cost of bus trips, we need to multiply the number of bus trips per week by the cost per trip. Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is 2 x 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 x $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. So, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we can add the number of cows and sheep from both places. 

Total animals = 30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

"To determine the cost of the house, we can use the concept of ratios. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up a proportion:

House cost / Lot cost = 3
Let's represent the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

The total cost is the sum of the house and lot costs: x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot (x), we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate Josh's cookies as follows:

Josh's cookies = Suzanne's cookies / 4
Josh's cookies = 36 / 4
Josh's cookies = 9

Now, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. To find out how many cookies Kelsie made, we can multiply Josh's cookies by 2:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 * 9
Kelsie's cookies = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ali has a total of $160, consisting of 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. To find the amount of money Ali gives to his sister, we need to calculate half of the total amount.

Half of $160 is calculated as: $160 / 2 = $80.

Now, we subtract the amount given to his sister from the total amount: $160 - $80 = $80.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining amount of money, which is $80. To do this, we multiply $80 by 3/5:

"The art of strawberry picking! As a strawberry connoisseur, I can assure you that the key to maximizing yields lies in understanding the unique picking patterns of each individual. Let's break it down:

Tony, the seasoned strawberry picker, can collect 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. His efficiency is unmatched, much like the bright sunshine that ripens the strawberries to perfection.

Bobby, on the other hand, picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, which translates to 5 quarts per hour. This slight decrease in yield is akin to the subtle nuances in flavor that set high-quality strawberries apart from the rest.

Kathy, the strawberry enthusiast, can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, resulting in a total of 10 quarts per hour. Her dedication to the craft is reminiscent of the vibrant yellow hues that adorn the strawberry fields.

Lastly, Ricky, the young and ambitious picker, can collect two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, yielding 8 quarts per hour. His eagerness to learn is as boundless as the yellow sun that shines upon the strawberry plants.

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarts that can be picked per hour by adding the individual yields:

6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29

The total number of quarts of strawberries that can be picked per hour is 29.

Final Answer: The final answer is 29."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we need to consider the total number of loaves baked, the number of loaves sold, and the number of loaves returned.

The bakery initially baked 200 loaves of bread. In the morning, they sold 93 loaves, and in the afternoon, they sold 39 loaves. To find the total number of loaves sold, we can add the morning and afternoon sales: 93 + 39 = 132.

To find the number of loaves left, we subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked: 200 - 132 = 68.

However, the bakery received 6 unsold loaves back from the grocery store. To find the final number of loaves left, we add the returned loaves to the number of loaves left after sales: 68 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can use the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time required to complete the task.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as 10 days (twice the time for half a house). 

Now, we can use the formula: Time = (Total Work) / (Number of Workers)

In this case, the total work is 1 whole house, and the number of workers is 5. 

Time = 1 / 5 = 0.2 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24:

0.2 days * 24 hours/day = 4.8 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people approximately 4.8 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 4.8"

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Remaining amount = Total amount paid - Cost of the headphone set
= $48 - $44
= $4

Since the cost of one CD is $4, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought:

Number of additional CDs = Remaining amount ÷ Cost of one CD
= $4 ÷ $4
= 1

Therefore, Tom could have bought 1 more CD if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

The correct answer is A."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. Let's calculate James' age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30 years.

Twice James' age in 8 years is 2 x 30 = 60 years. Since his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age, his cousin's age in 8 years will be 60 - 5 = 55 years.

To find the current age of James' cousin, subtract 8 years from his age in 8 years: 55 - 8 = 47 years.

The age difference between James and his cousin is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. To find out how much he needs to save in the second half of the month, we can start by assuming the first half of the month is x. Since the second half is twice as much, it's 2x.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms: 3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3: x = 375

So, Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. The second half is 2x, which is 2 * 375 = $750.

To find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half, we divide the total savings for the second half by 15 (the number of days in the second half):

$750 ÷ 15 = $50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

where S is the sum, a is the first term (3), r is the common ratio (3), and n is the number of terms (4).

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (3^4 - 1) / (3 - 1)
S = 3 * (81 - 1) / 2
S = 3 * 80 / 2
S = 120

Therefore, the total number of families notified in the fourth round is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use the concept of linear decline. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's break it down:

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to calculate the number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{402}$"
"As an engineering student, I can help you calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy. To do this, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

The final answer is: $27"
"Let's calculate the total cost of Carly's order.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together.

The cost of hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20
The cost of potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3
The cost of fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10

The total cost of the items: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly pays with a $50 bill. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill:
$50 - $33 = $17

Carly gets $17 in change.

The final answer is: $17"
"As a marketing expert, I can break down the commission calculation into two parts: the base commission and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

The base commission for sales up to $1000 is calculated as 30% of the sales amount, which is $1000. This can be expressed as 0.3 * $1000.

To calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000, we need to find the amount exceeding $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). The additional commission is then 10% of this amount, which is 0.1 * $1500.

The total commission earned by Antonella can be found by adding the base commission and the additional commission.

Base commission = 0.3 * $1000 = $300
Additional commission = 0.1 * $1500 = $150
Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

Final Answer: The final answer is $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs, we can follow a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill already has. Since he has 2 cases of water with 24 bottles each, we can multiply the number of cases by the number of bottles per case: 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Bill needs for his guests. He wants 2 bottles of water for each of his 70 guests, so we multiply the number of guests by 2: 70 * 2 = 140 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles Bill needs, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles.

Therefore, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"Let's dive into the world of swimming speeds and times. As someone who appreciates the vibrant color yellow, I find it fascinating how it can evoke feelings of warmth and energy, much like the sensation of swimming through calm waters.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold and hot day. 

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we can multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 × 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 × 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: 54"
"Let's break down John's weekly earnings to determine how many weeks it will take him to save $80.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked per day and then by the number of days worked per week:

Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week = $40/week

To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we can divide the amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

$80 ÷ $40/week = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We know that x + y = 14 (since there are 14 buttons with four holes). We also know that the total number of buttons is 21.

We can set up the equation: x + y = 21

We are given that 7 buttons have two holes, so x = 7.

Now, we can substitute x into the equation: 7 + y = 21

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get: y = 14

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes: 7 x 2 = 14

The total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 14 x 4 = 56

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70

The final answer is: 70"
" locker sizes are a fascinating topic in spatial geometry. As someone who appreciates the beauty of yellow, I'd like to dive into the problem at hand.

To find the size of Peter's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the locker sizes. We know that Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, and Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's. This can be represented as:

Zack's locker size = (1/2) × Timothy's locker size
Zack's locker size = (1/2) × 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 12 cubic inches

Now, we're told that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. This can be represented as:

Peter's locker size = (1/4) × Zack's locker size
Peter's locker size = (1/4) × 12 cubic inches
Peter's locker size = 3 cubic inches

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.

"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we need to calculate the difference between his current consumption and the recommended amount.

Juan's current consumption is 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, and since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, her daily consumption is 0.5 cups. Therefore, Juan's daily consumption is 0.5 * 10 = 5 cups.

The recommended daily intake is 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from Juan's current consumption:

5 - 4 = 1

Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"As a rodent expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of rodents in the pet shop.

The pet shop has 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. To find the total number of rodents, we can use the formula:

Total Rodents = (Number of hamster cages * Hamsters per cage) + (Number of guinea pig cages * Guinea pigs per cage)
Total Rodents = (3 * 10) + (3 * 5)
Total Rodents = 30 + 15
Total Rodents = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.

The final answer is: 45"
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we can use the formula for average:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20
Susan's weight = 150 - 20
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's weight:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"The angle of the sun's position relative to the ground can be calculated using trigonometry. Given that the initial angle is 32 degrees and the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle after 10 hours.

Let's denote the initial angle as θ1 = 32 degrees and the hourly movement as d = 5 degrees. The total angle after 10 hours can be calculated as:

θ2 = θ1 + 10d
= 32 + 10(5)
= 32 + 50
= 82 degrees

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: 82"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we need to calculate the number of candles required and then multiply it by the cost per pack.

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. As a parent, I can confidently say that James needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles for his sons.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs needed by the cost per pack: 10 / 5 * 3 = 6.

Therefore, James will spend $6 on birthday candles.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the pages read in the first week. Since Judy reads 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can find the total minutes she read in the first week by multiplying the minutes per night by the number of nights.

Total minutes in the first week = 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Since Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find the pages read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5.

Pages read in the first week = 105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page = 70 pages

Now, we know Judy read 70 pages in the first week. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Total pages read in two weeks = Pages read in the first week + Pages read in the second week
= 70 pages + 100 pages
= 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor.

Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches, which is (1/3) × 12 = 4 sandwiches.

Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches, which is (1/4) × 12 = 3 sandwiches.

In total, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial number of sandwiches: 12 - 7 = 5.

There are 5 sandwiches left."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationship between Shiloh's and his nephew's ages.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be represented by the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break it down into three parts.

First, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. This is a fixed amount.

Next, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each. This is a linear increase of $1.00 per tooth. So, the total amount for these three teeth is 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. So, that's 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"Soccer enthusiasts, let's dive into the world of goal scoring. As a sports enthusiast, I've got the inside scoop on this one.

We're given that Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna. We also know Richie scored 80 goals. To find the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can set up two equations:

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

From the first statement, we can write an equation:
Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

Solving for M, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now, we can solve for Anna's goals:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Solving for A, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"

$84 - $63 = $21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam selling lemonade that weekend.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate his daily expenditure and the remaining amount of money.

Peter has $70 initially and spends an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $5 each day, so his total expenditure for these four days is:
$5 * 4 = $20

He has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $50 left, so he can buy:
$50 / $2 = 25

Since he can't buy a fraction of a figure, he will buy 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
- 3 wooden action figures
- 25 plastic action figures

Total action figures = 3 + 25 = 28

The final answer is 28."
"As a feline behaviorist, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of the situation. To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to consider the expenses associated with spaying, vaccinations, and damages.

The cost of spaying the kitten is a one-time expense, which is $200. The cost of vaccinations is a recurring expense, with each vaccine costing $20. Since Leah has 3 vaccines, the total cost of vaccinations is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the broken vases is a one-time expense, with each vase costing $12. Since the kitten broke 4 vases, the total cost of damages is 4 * $12 = $48.

To find the total cost, we can add these expenses together: $200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccinations) + $48 (damages) = $308.

The total cost of the kitten so far is $308."
"As a gardening expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a solution.

Ford's garden produces 40 roses per week. To determine the total number of roses needed to supply all the flower shops, we need to calculate the total demand. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

Total roses per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses per week by 4 to find the total roses needed per month:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Ford's garden produces 40 roses per week. To find out how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed:
260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P - (P * r * t)

Where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial amount) = $3000
r = monthly withdrawal rate = $100
t = time (in months) = 24

However, since this is a simple subtraction problem, we can simply multiply the monthly withdrawal by the number of months:

Total amount withdrawn = $100 * 24
Total amount withdrawn = $2400

Now, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
Remaining amount = $3000 - $2400
Remaining amount = $600

The final answer is $600."
"As a financial analyst specializing in food truck operations, I've crunched the numbers to determine the net profit of this grilled cheese food truck.

To calculate the net profit, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost.

Total revenue: 
Number of sandwiches sold = 10
Price per sandwich = $7.00
Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, each containing 64 crayons. To find the total number of crayons, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box.

Total crayons = 3 * 64
Total crayons = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together to make a muffin, we need to divide the total number of crayons by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons she can make.

Muffin crayons = Total crayons / 8
Muffin crayons = 192 / 8
Muffin crayons = 24

Now, we know Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

Total money = Muffin crayons * $1.50
Total money = 24 * $1.50

"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

The correct answer is: 540.8"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can represent this as 12 cups.

She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

To find the total number of cups, we can add Judy's cups and her friend's cups: 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

To find the total number of dishes, we can add Judy's dishes and her friend's dishes: 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is the sum of cups and dishes: 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"As a contact lens expert, I can provide you with the most accurate information. 

To calculate the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first find the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. Since each box is $100.00 and is currently 10% off, we can calculate the discounted price as follows:

Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes. Since 1 box contains 90 pairs, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"

To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we need to determine the total calories burned from her activities.

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. We can calculate the total calories burned as follows:

Total calories burned = (500 calories/hour * 2 hours) + (600 calories/hour * 1 hour)
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find the number of 200-calorie units:

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Now, we multiply the number of units by 100 to find the total amount of water needed:

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"The delightful world of jelly bean proportions! As a color connoisseur with a soft spot for the vibrant hue of yellow, I'm excited to dive into this problem.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. We're given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Furthermore, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we have:

G = 1.01B

Now, let's substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.01B = 4500

Simplify:

2.01B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.01:

B = 2250

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(2250)
R = 2227.5

And, finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(2250)
G = 2260.5

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 2260.5 - 2227.5
G - R = 33

The final answer is: 33"
"To calculate the average of Jared's typing speeds, we need to add the three measurements and divide by 3.

Let's denote Jared's initial speed as x = 47 WPM, his increased speed as x + 5 = 52 WPM, and his new speed as x + 10 = 57 WPM.

The sum of the three speeds is x + (x + 5) + (x + 10) = 3x + 15.

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
(3x + 15) / 3 = x + 5

Since we know Jared's initial speed is 47 WPM, we can substitute x = 47 into the equation:
(3(47) + 15) / 3 = 47 + 5

Now, let's calculate the sum:
(141 + 15) / 3 = 156 / 3

Finally, we divide by 3:
156 / 3 = 52

The average of Jared's typing speeds is 52 WPM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"As a nutrition expert, I can analyze the impact of breakfast choices on weight gain or loss. When considering the effects of daily breakfast options on weight, it's essential to understand the caloric intake and macronutrient balance.

Martin's daily breakfast choices have a significant impact on his weight. If he consumes Cheerios, a low-calorie, high-fiber cereal, he can expect to lose 1.25 pounds per week. On the other hand, if he chooses donuts, a high-calorie, high-sugar food, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week.

To determine the difference in weight after 5 weeks, we can calculate the weight change for each option:

Weight change due to Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change due to donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - (-6.25) = 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the number of people initially invited by Alex, the number of friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Alex initially invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of friends invited is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"As a canine nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the weights of the dogs in the waiting room.

The weights of the dogs are related in a specific sequence. Let's break it down:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"When comparing the costs of the boots on Amazon and eBay, we need to consider the prices and shipping costs for an accurate calculation.

The boots cost $16 on Amazon, and shipping costs $4. On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

To find the total cost of the boots on eBay, we add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost: $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, let's compare the total costs:

Amazon: $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20
eBay: $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21

The difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

Final Answer: The final answer is $1."
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the realm of exponential functions. As someone who appreciates the beauty of yellow, I'd like to highlight that the growth pattern of the beanstalk can be modeled using the equation:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t, and t is the number of days.

To find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (20 feet), we need to solve for t when h(t) > 20.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk on each day:

Day 1: h(1) = 4 * 2^1 = 8 feet
Day 2: h(2) = 4 * 2^2 = 16 feet
Day 3: h(3) = 4 * 2^3 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window (20 feet).

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to multiply the grams of protein he gets per day by 7.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can set up a proportion to find the grams of protein per day.

Let x be the grams of protein per day. We can set up the proportion:

200 grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein per cup = x grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein per cup

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

200 * 3 = 3x
600 = 3x
x = 600 / 3
x = 200 grams of protein per day

Now, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week:

200 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week = 1400 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 1400"
"Let's dive into the problem of Jerry's age.

We're given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be represented by the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by distributing the 2:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So, Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The base price of each implant is $2000, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours to cover the remaining amount.

The final answer is: 260"
"In the context of triangle geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle (x) and the third angle is three times the smallest angle (3x), we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the largest angle is 90 degrees, the correct answer is:

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"Let's break down Colby's available funds to determine the maximum number of gumballs he can buy.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is equivalent to 8 x $0.25 = $2.00.
He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
Additionally, he has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
Lastly, he has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."

The total number of legs can be calculated as follows:

(5 dogs * 4 legs/dog) + (2 cats * 4 legs/cat) + (10 birds * 2 legs/bird)
= 20 + 8 + 20
= 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs in the store is 48.

The final answer is 48."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. To find the weight he uses after increasing it by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

The weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. So, we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight Jamaal uses now is 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the three years.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This totals to 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve receives another 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This totals to 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month. This totals to 5 + 24 = 29 games. He also receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after three years, we add the games from each year: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the time it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its rate as follows:

Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Final answer: 5"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to find their individual hourly production rates and then multiply those rates by 12.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his hourly production rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz in an hour. To find her hourly production rate, we multiply Ruiz's rate by 3/4: (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"Let's break down Howard's spending pattern to determine how much money he has left.

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. This is a straightforward transaction.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64.

To find the total amount spent, we add the individual amounts: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find the amount left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"As a lemonade sales expert, I can break down the problem into two distinct periods and calculate the total earnings accordingly.

Let's analyze the situation:

Patrick sold lemonade for 4 hours at a rate of 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup. This can be calculated as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold lemonade at a rate of 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup. This can be calculated as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods:

$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"As a tire expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the tire's lifespan.

To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations and then divide it by the maximum number of rotations the tire can undergo.

Given that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in 6 years.

"Let's dive into the world of shampoo economics. As a color theory enthusiast, I find the vibrant hue of sunshine yellow to be particularly inspiring. Now, let's get to the task at hand.

We're given that a jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and yields 120 washings when 2 pumps are used. To find the cost of each pump, we need to calculate the cost per washing and then divide it by the number of washings per pump.

Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump.

Cost per pump = $0.20 / 1 = $0.20

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100.

Cost per pump = $0.20 * 100 = 20 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 20 cents.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of $25. 

The discount amount is $25 * 0.3 = $7.50.

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount. The sales tax rate is 8% (0.08). 

The tax amount is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase.

The final amount Joe will have left is -$6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter required per dozen. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can set up the following equation:

Butter needed per day = 4 dozen croissants/day * (1/4 pound/dozen)
Butter needed per day = 4 * (1/4) pound
Butter needed per day = 1 pound

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

Total butter needed = Butter needed per day * 7
Total butter needed = 1 pound * 7
Total butter needed = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"As a civil engineer specializing in road construction, I can provide a precise calculation for the cost difference between repaving two streets of different lengths.

Given:
- Cost per meter: $194
- Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
- Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street:

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $194 × 490 = $94,660

Next, we calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street:

Cost of repaving Monica's street = $194 × 150 = $29,100

The difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street is:

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
= $94,660 - $29,100
= $65,560

Therefore, repaving Lewis' street costs $65,560 more than repaving Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,560"
"As a researcher in the field of biotechnology, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs associated with John's cancer cell research project.

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000 per month, totaling $500,000. This represents a fixed cost for the initial phase of the research.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This is a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula:

Funding (in thousands) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(month - 5)

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:

- Month 6: 100,000 * (1.5)^(6-5) = 100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: 100,000 * (1.5)^(7-5) = 100,000 * 2.25 = $225,000
- Month 8: 100,000 * (1.5)^(8-5) = 100,000 * 3.375 = $337,500
- Month 9: 100,000 * (1.5)^(9-5) = 100,000 * 5.0625 = $506,250
- Month 10: 100,000 * (1.5)^(10-5) = 100,000 * 7.59375 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625.

"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators and parents, and then subtract that from the total number of seats.

First, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators:
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by parents:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 54 seats = 0 seats

However, this result doesn't make sense, as there must be some students present. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation is:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats * 1/3 = 24 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 24 seats = 30 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 30."
"As a traffic engineer specializing in street lighting, I can provide a precise calculation for the total number of functioning street lights.

With 4 intersections on the road, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

However, 20 street lights are not functioning. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning ones: 96 - 20 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76.

Final Answer: The final answer is 76."
"When calculating the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to consider the remaining lifespan of each DVD. 

Let's analyze the situation:

DVD 1 has been played 356 times, leaving it with 1000 - 356 = 644 times left.
DVD 2 has been played 135 times, leaving it with 1000 - 135 = 865 times left.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we simply add the remaining times for each DVD: 644 + 865 = 1509.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"As a physical therapist, I can provide a detailed analysis of John's physical therapy sessions.

To calculate the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to determine the total number of hours John attended therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour. Since John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, we can calculate the total number of sessions as follows:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Each session is 2 hours long, so the total number of hours is:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost is:

24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000.

The final answer is: $3000"
"To calculate the number of pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to break down his gum-chewing activities throughout the day.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can calculate the total number of pieces chewed at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to the total.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces

Now, let's calculate the number of pieces Jim has left after chewing 6 pieces. Initially, he had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 - 6 = 14 pieces

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's current age, we need to subtract 12 from her age in 12 years. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can calculate her current age as follows:

Current age = Age in 12 years - 12
Current age = 16 - 12
Current age = 4

Now, we need to add 4 to her current age to find her age 4 years from now.

Age 4 years from now = Current age + 4
Age 4 years from now = 4 + 4
Age 4 years from now = 8

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now."
"Let's dive into the world of sports shopping. As a sports enthusiast, I'd be happy to help you calculate the difference in spending between the two coaches.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent is:
9 × $3 = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent is:
8 × $14 = $112

Now, we need to find the difference between the two amounts:
$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden, we can multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers
Fraction bloomed = 4/5

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * Fraction bloomed
= 200 * 4/5
= 200 * 0.8
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160.

Final answer: 160"
"As a digital speed expert, I can help you convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h).

To do this, we need to perform a unit conversion. We know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). So, we can convert Ashley's speed from kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h by multiplying by 60:

0.02 Mb/s × 60 s/min × 60 min/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb/h.

The final answer is: 72"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We have a tow truck that pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days. To find the total number of cars towed on these days, we can multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Since there are 4 remaining days, we can multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide by his annual growth rate.

The required height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"As a seasoned automotive expert, I can break down the problem step by step.

To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, which means they paid $7,500 per car. The selling price of each car is $25,000. The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

Now, James gets a 10% commission on the profits. To find his commission, we multiply the total profit by 0.1: 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate 25% of the total number of riders, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 25 by 0.6, which equals 15. 

The remaining riders who can stay upright are men, so we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is 10."
"As a jewelry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel, which is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we add the prices of diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16 (given). We also know that T = S + 3 (since Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps) and R = T - 9 (since Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps).

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for T: T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Then, we can substitute the value of T into the equation for R: R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding the number of each type of stamp: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since Bob is driving 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up as 't' hours. In this time, Bob will cover a distance of 55t miles, and Tom will cover a distance of 70t miles. Since Tom needs to catch up with Bob, the distance between them should be zero when Tom catches up.

We can set up the equation: 55t - 70t = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get: -15t = 0

Dividing both sides by -15, we get: t = 0

However, this is not possible since Tom needs to catch up with Bob. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. Since they are moving in the same direction, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed.

First, we need to find the relative speed. Since Tom is driving 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour, the relative speed is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"Let's dive into the world of fish catching and solve this problem.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi. To find out how many fish Darren caught, we can subtract 6 from Naomi's total:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we can add 3 to Darren's total:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. To find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes: 

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. To do this, we subtract the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes:

10 (classes signed up for) - 6 (maximum classes) = 4 classes

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. To find Julie's daily production, we can multiply Jewel's daily production by 2.

Julie's daily production = 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is the sum of their daily productions.

Total weekly production = 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by 7.

Total weekly production = 150 * 7 = 1050 customers

The final answer is: 1050"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 x 4 = 20 miles. Since Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can set up an equation to find Lynn's distance:

Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3
20 = Lynn's distance + 3

To solve for Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Lynn's distance = 20 - 3
Lynn's distance = 17

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can use the given prices and multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

Therefore, Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is:

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3:

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to consider the base price and the additional features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an additional $7,500. Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so the cost of leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, let's add up the costs:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current monthly salary of $20,000. This can be calculated as:

Raise = 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the raise and bonus to his current monthly salary to get his new monthly salary:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

Yearly salary = $31,000 x 12 = $372,000

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the initial number of likes and then add the new likes.

The number of likes after 1 week is 2000. Three weeks later, the number of likes is 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. 

Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. Then, the number of likes after 3 weeks is 70x. We know that 70x = 2000. To find x, we can divide both sides by 70.

x = 2000 / 70
x = 28.57

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes.

"To determine the number of eggs needed for the party, we can use a simple multiplication problem. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves per guest.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 x 3 = 48

Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we can divide by 12.

"As an aviation expert, I can break down the costs associated with owning and maintaining a plane. To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly rent, and monthly fuel costs.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

To find the total monthly cost, we add the monthly rent and fuel cost: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we need to calculate the individual cooking times for each food item. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut purchase, we need to consider the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate the cost per pound as follows:

Cost of normal brand = $5 per pound
Increase in cost = 20% of $5 = 0.20 x $5 = $1
Cost of more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the more expensive brand is:

7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, we get:

$42 + $2 = $44

Therefore, the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut purchase is $44.

Final answer: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased and subtract that from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chips and other items: 
2 * $2.00 = $4.00
$4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's break it down:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we subtract the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total:

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To calculate the total number of recipes John learns, we need to determine the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours required to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total number of hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we can divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

48 ÷ 1.5 = 32

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"To determine the number of math teachers, we can calculate the percentage of teachers that are not history teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - (0.6 * 150)
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

The total amount of money they have is the sum of their individual amounts:

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
= 120 + 90 + 150
= 360

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

Shared amount = Total amount / 3
= 360 / 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"As a sports enthusiast and basketball aficionado, I can confidently calculate the total game duration.

The game consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. To find the total time, we can multiply the number of quarters by the length of each quarter:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

However, since the last quarter was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie, we need to add this extra time to the total:

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

The final answer is: 53"
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of the total employees and then find 30% of that result.

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, find 30% of the 10 management employees:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we can multiply the amount of each ingredient by the number of muffins.

For flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
For sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
For salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

Total amount of dry ingredients needed: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To find the total amount of candy, we need to add the amount of candy each person had: 
3 (Robert) + 5 (Cindy) + 4 (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Since they want to share it equally, we divide the total amount by 3:
12 ÷ 3 = 4

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."
"To calculate the change Adam received, we need to determine the total cost of the candies he purchased. 

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is $4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days and eight bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we need to find the number of good days left in the month.

To find the number of good days left, we need to first find the total number of good days. We know that the first 8 days were good, and the next 3 days were good. So, the total number of good days is:

Total good days = 8 + 3 = 11

Now, we can find the number of good days left in the month by subtracting the total number of good days from the total number of days:

Good days left = Total days - Total good days
= 30 - 11
= 19

The final answer is 19."
"Let's dive into the world of algebra to solve this problem. As someone who loves the bright and cheerful color yellow, I find the concept of variables and equations to be quite fascinating.

We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent this relationship with the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate the variable x, which represents the number of books Sally has, we'll follow the order of operations. First, we'll subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 18 ÷ 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs 1 toy. This is a basic understanding of canine needs and toy allocation.

When James returns to the shelter, he finds that there are 8 more dogs, making the total number of dogs 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog requires one toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, upon his return, James discovers that 3 dogs have left the shelter, reducing the number of dogs to 12 - 3 = 9 dogs. Therefore, James now needs 9 toys.

To calculate the total number of toys James needs, we can subtract the initial number of toys he had (4) from the current number of dogs (9), which gives us 9 - 4 = 5 additional toys. Adding these to the initial 4 toys, James requires a total of 4 + 5 = 9 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 9.

9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a joint savings account with an initial investment of $1200. Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount. To find out how much Dylan invested, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 * (2/5) = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

$1200 - $480 = $720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find out how much Frances invested, we multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 * (2/3) = 480

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:

$720 - $480 = $240

So, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their goal and the total number of signatures they already have.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they have is C + J = 20 + 44 = 64.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we can set up an equation: C + J + x = 100, where x is the number of signatures they need to collect. We can substitute the values of C and J into the equation: 20 + 44 + x = 100.

Now, let's solve for x: 64 + x = 100. Subtracting 64 from both sides, we get x = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Lorie earns $10 per hour. To find out how much she earns in two days, we need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in two days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Lorie works 2 * 24 = 48 hours in two days.

Lorie's earnings in two days = 10 * 48 = $480

Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, Karen's earnings in two days are:
2 * 480 = $960

Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns in 3 hours per day for 2 days. 
Karen's daily earnings = 3 * 10 = $30
Karen's earnings in two days = 30 * 2 = $60

The final answer is $60."
"As a potato expert, I can confidently calculate the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes. 

To determine the number of hash browns, we can use the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

Answer: 576"
"When calculating the total weight of the 9 people, we need to consider the weight of each individual. Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can multiply this value by the number of people to find the total weight.

Total weight = 9 x 80 kg
Total weight = 720 kg

To determine the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator (700 kg) from the total weight.

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator's maximum load of 700 kg will be exceeded by 20 kg when Jack rides with 8 other adults."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's cookies. To find Max's cookies, we can add 5 to Katarina's cookies:

Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5
Max's cookies = 73

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookies by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:

Cookie Monster's cookies = Max's cookies - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 73 - 12
Cookie Monster's cookies = 61

Now, we know the number of cookies each person has. To find the total number of cookies, we can add them up:

Total cookies = Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookie Monster's cookies + Summer's cookies
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + Summer's cookies

We are given that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. To find Summer's cookies, we can add 23 to Max's cookies:

Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies = 73 + 23
Summer's cookies = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding up all the cookies:

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. 

The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can use the concept of average speed. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can calculate the average time as follows:

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Average time = (Time taken in ""turtle"" mode + Time taken in ""rabbit"" mode) / 2
Average time = (60 + 40) / 2
Average time = 100 / 2
Average time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the remaining time available.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They have already spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Time spent so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"Let's break down the costs of the items Catherine purchased.

The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4. Since she buys 1 kilo, the total cost remains $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.

The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

To find the total cost, we add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"As a baking expert, I can confidently calculate the number of cookies left in the box. 

To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's tackle this problem with a fresh perspective.

We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can represent the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as an equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since we're dealing with whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number for the triplet's age, as age is typically measured in whole years. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before dinner. 

First, we convert 3 hours into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time for all his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to consider the individual costs of each item. 

The cost of one lollipop is $0.40, so the cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of one candy is $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rong saves 20 coins per month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find Neil's monthly savings, we can calculate 2/5 of Rong's savings and add it to Rong's savings.

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
= 20 + (2/5 * 20)
= 20 + 8
= 28

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply their monthly savings by 120 (12 * 10).

Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
= 2400

Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
= 3360

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.

Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
= 2400 + 3360
= 5760

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"As a veterinarian, I'd be happy to help you calculate the amount John leaves with after paying for his dog's vet visit.

To find the total cost of the vaccines, we multiply the cost of one vaccine by 2: 
2 vaccines * $20 = $40

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's call the total bill 'x'. We can set up the equation: 
0.6x = 40
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

The total bill is $66.67. Now, we subtract the total bill from the amount John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with:

"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the expressions for B and G into the equation for W:
W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for W:
W = 14 - 2
W = 12

Now that we have the number of each color, we can calculate the total area:
Total area = R + B + G + W
Total area = 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + 12
Total area = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total area = 68

"To determine the total points the class is missing, we need to calculate the points for each student and then subtract the total from the minimum threshold.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is 145 points short of the minimum threshold to go on the trip."
"To calculate the total number of great grand-babies, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each of Great Grandma Jones' children has three children, and each of those children has three babies of their own, we can represent this as a geometric progression.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"To calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the fireworks in the city and the fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate 40% of the total number of fireworks in the city. The city has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

To find 40% of 300, we can multiply 300 by 0.4:
300 * 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard:
120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to consider the number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 19 people in total, including Aiden and his 12 friends, and the 7 additional friends who join them. Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

The total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

The total amount the three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount Gissela and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total: 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can use the information provided. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and each male ate 1 more than each female, we can express the number of dumplings eaten by each male as 3 + 1 = 4.

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as F and the number of dumplings eaten by each male as M. We know that F = 3 and M = F + 1.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8M, and the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6F. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females.

We can set up the equation: 8M + 6F = Total dumplings

Substituting M = F + 1, we get: 8(F + 1) + 6F = Total dumplings
Expanding the equation: 8F + 8 + 6F = Total dumplings
Combine like terms: 14F + 8 = Total dumplings

We know that F = 3, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 14(3) + 8 = Total dumplings
Simplifying the equation: 42 + 8 = Total dumplings
Evaluating the expression: 50 = Total dumplings

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

Final answer: 50"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means that the total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

To find Gerald's initial amount, we can use the formula: (Gerald's share / Total parts) * Total amount. 

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so his initial amount is (3/5) * 100 = $60.

Now, Gerald spent $10 on a book. To find out how much he had left, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount: 60 - 10 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"Let's dive into the world of animal locomotion and explore the speed of Martha's turtle.

When comparing the speed of the cat and the turtle, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can express this relationship as a ratio:

Cat's speed : Turtle's speed = 5 : 1

Given the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5:

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second ÷ 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, to find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can divide the remaining amount they need to raise ($6300 - $2100 = $4200) by the amount they raise per hour.

$4200 ÷ $2100 per hour = 2 hours

Since the firefighters need to raise $4200 in total and they raise an equal amount per hour, they need to fundraise for 2 more hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: 2"
"As a hydrologist specializing in water resource management, I can provide a detailed analysis of the Colorado River's water usage.

To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.

Let's calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes: 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%.

Now, subtract this from 100% to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%.

Therefore, 68% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we can multiply the number of days in 2 weeks by her daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be:
14 days x $12 per day = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"As a pastry expert, I can calculate the total bill with ease. To find the total cost of Marcus' order, I'll add up the cost of each item.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:
- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, I'll calculate 10% of the total cost: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The total bill is $45.00."
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we can apply the concept of fractional parts to the deal. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can consider it as a 3:1 ratio. 

Let's calculate the total number of scoops Erin can afford with her $6.00. Each scoop costs $1.50, so we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find the total number of scoops:

$6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops

Since Erin gets 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops she buys, we can consider the effective cost of 3 scoops. 

So, Erin should buy 3 scoops of ice cream.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: 14"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles needed to cover two thirds of a 36 sq ft bathroom, we can use the following calculation:

(2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24:

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To calculate the cost-effectiveness of picking blueberries, we need to consider the total cost of both options. 

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as follows: 
Initial cost: $20
Additional cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30
Total cost of picking: $20 + ($1.5 * 30) = $20 + $45 = $65

On the other hand, the cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 per pound, and James picked 30 pounds. So, the total cost of buying blueberries at the store is $2.5 * 30 = $75.

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10.

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

"As a clog dancing expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total number of taps Helga performs.

Let's analyze the situation:

Helga dances for 5 minutes with her arms at her sides for 3 minutes and with her arms raised for 2 minutes. We need to calculate the total number of taps for each scenario and then add them together.

Scenario 1: Both hands at her sides (3 minutes)
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 900 taps
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 750 taps
- Combined taps: 900 + 750 = 1650 taps

Scenario 2: Arms raised (2 minutes)
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps

"As a road maintenance expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a detailed calculation to determine the cost savings of fixing the pothole.

To calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole, we need to consider the cost of materials and labor. Assuming Ron will perform the repair himself, the cost of materials is $120 (fine) + $75 (3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each) = $195. However, this calculation only accounts for the costs associated with the fine and asphalt. We also need to consider the cost of the damage to Ron's car, which is $450.

The total cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the cost of materials and the cost of the damage to the car: $195 (materials) + $450 (damage) = $645.

Now, let's calculate the cost savings by fixing the pothole. The cost savings is the difference between the total cost of not fixing the pothole and the total cost of fixing the pothole: $645 (total cost of fixing the pothole) - $450 (cost of not fixing the pothole) = $195.

Therefore, Ron saves $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

Final answer: $195"
"To determine the number of chairs left, we need to subtract the total number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total number of chairs.

Let's break it down:

Initial total chairs = Normal chairs + Baby chairs
= 170 + 23
= 193

Chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs sent + Baby chairs sent

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"To determine the number of slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten and subtract it from the total number of slices.

Since there are 5 pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60.

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate ¾ * 12 = 9 slices.

Total slices eaten = 8 + 9 = 17 slices.

To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 17 = 43.

The final answer is 43."
"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can use the formula for average:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

Given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time taken by dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
= 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time:

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Since Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, we first convert 8 feet to inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 96 + 4 = 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

Now, we can write the equation: 9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

This means 2000 people voted by midday. To find the number of people remaining, we subtract this from the total number of people:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

This means 2000 more people voted by 16:00. To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the total number of people who voted from the total number of people:

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we can calculate the total number of smores required and then divide it by the number of smores per box.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores, we can calculate the total number of smores per box:
3 sleeves/sleeve * 8 smores/sleeve = 24 smores/box

Now, we can divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores per box to find the number of boxes required:
24 smores/box ÷ 24 smores/box = 1 box

Therefore, 1 box of graham crackers is needed.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Dora's age is 15 years. We can use this information to find the ages of her father and mother.

Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can represent this as an equation:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 38 years

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can represent this as another equation:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34 years

Now, we can find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. To find Beck's initial amount of apples, we subtract 23 from Boris's initial amount.

Beck's initial amount = 100 - 23
Beck's initial amount = 77 apples

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find the new amount of apples Beck has, we add 10 to Beck's initial amount.

Beck's new amount = 77 + 10
Beck's new amount = 87 apples

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's new amount from Boris's new amount.

Difference = Boris's new amount - Beck's new amount
Difference = 90 - 87

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Clara has 20 books, and she has two times as many books as Steven. To find out how many books Steven has, we can divide Clara's total by 2.

Clara's total books = 20
Steven's total books = Clara's total / 2
Steven's total books = 20 / 2
Steven's total books = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can subtract 6 from Steven's total to find Alice's total.

Alice's total books = Steven's total - 6
Alice's total books = 10 - 6
Alice's total books = 4

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we can subtract Alice's total from Clara's total.

Clara's total books - Alice's total books = 20 - 4
Clara's total books - Alice's total books = 16

"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students who like to bake as B, the number of students who like to play basketball as C, the number of students who like to play video games as V, and the number of students who like to play music as M. We are given that T = 50, B = 10, and C = 5.

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, so M = 2C = 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is B + C = 10 + 5 = 15, we can find the number of students who like to play video games or play music by subtracting this from the total number of students: T - (B + C) = 50 - 15 = 35.

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can use the information that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Let's denote the total number of students in each class as x. Since 40% of the students are girls, the number of girls in each class is 0.4x.

We know that the total number of students in each class is 40, so we can set up the equation:

x = 40

Since 40% of the students are girls, the number of boys in each class is the remaining 60% of the total number of students. We can express this as:

Number of boys = 0.6x

Substituting x = 40 into the equation, we get:

Number of boys = 0.6(40)
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Mark buys 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total Cost = 3 packs * $1800 per pack
Total Cost = $5400

Mark finds 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. The total value of these two cards is:

Total Value of High-Value Cards = $4000 + $1000
Total Value of High-Value Cards = $5000

In addition to the high-value cards, Mark finds 30 cards worth an average of $50 each. The total value of these cards is:

Total Value of Low-Value Cards = 30 cards * $50 per card
Total Value of Low-Value Cards = $1500

The total value of all the cards Mark finds is the sum of the high-value cards and the low-value cards:

Total Value of All Cards = Total Value of High-Value Cards + Total Value of Low-Value Cards
Total Value of All Cards = $5000 + $1500
Total Value of All Cards = $6500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of all the cards:

Profit = Total Value of All Cards - Total Cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost of each park and then find the difference.

The first amusement park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:
$26 * 2 (adults) + $12 * 2 (children) = $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:
$14 * 2 (adults) + $10 * 2 (children) = $28 + $20 = $48

The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day. He used to buy them for $0.5 each but now buys them from a new vendor for $0.4 each. To find the daily savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

Daily savings = (Old vendor's cost - New vendor's cost) = $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
= $0.1 * 7
= $0.7

The vendor saves $0.7 per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles, and he has half as many marbles as Cal. To find out how many marbles Cal has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we can find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together.

Carl and Cal's marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Carl and Cal's marbles = 224 + 112
Carl and Cal's marbles = 336

"As a chair rental expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

To calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months, we need to consider the number of weekdays and weekend days separately. 

Let's break it down:

- Weekdays: There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20.
- Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

- Weekends: There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8.
- Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in 4 weeks: 
Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"In the context of council voting dynamics, understanding the relationship between votes in favor and against is crucial. When a vote passes with twice as many votes in favor as there are against, it indicates a significant level of support. Given that the total number of council members is 33, we can model this situation using a simple equation.

Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which must equal 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against, we can calculate the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"

"Let's dive into the world of canine demographics. As a canine expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We know that 1/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of those Pomeranians are girls. To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can set up an equation:

1/3 * Total Pomeranians = 6

To isolate Total Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:

Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Now, since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:

2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2:

Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the total, it will need 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need 2x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 125 + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x + 125 = 250

Subtract 125 from both sides:

3x = 125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 41.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact value for calculation purposes. The third house needs 2x cases, which is 2 * 41.67 = 83.33 cases.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Total time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"

Emma's score can be calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score can be calculated as follows:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: $\boxed{895}$"
"To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 34

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, which can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15. 

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so we multiply 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2x

where x is the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = -11/2

x = -5.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. However, we can try to find a whole number solution.

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

"As a fuel efficiency expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car.

To determine the total distance traveled in a week, we need to consider the one-way distance between Andy's home and office, which is 5 miles. Since he travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is:

Total distance = 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week using Andy's fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
= 25 miles / 10 MPG
= 2.5 gallons

To find the cost of gas consumed per week, we multiply the gas consumed per week by the current price of regular gas, which is $3 per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters.

Carrie had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. To find the amount she spent, we multiply 3/5 by 20 (the value of one twenty). This can be represented as (3/5) * 20.

To calculate (3/5) * 20, we multiply the numerator (3) by 20 and then divide by the denominator (5). This gives us (3 * 20) / 5 = 60 / 5 = 12.

So, Carrie spent 12 twenties. Since she had 10 twenties initially, she has 10 - 12 = -2 twenties left. However, since we cannot have a negative number of twenties, we will assume she spent the 12 twenties and kept the rest of the money in other denominations.

Carrie had 140 quarters. She spent all of them. The value of 140 quarters is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

The total amount she spent is the sum of the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters. This can be represented as 12 + 35.

12 + 35 = 47

The final answer is 47."
"As a botanist specializing in horticulture, I can provide a detailed analysis of Ricardo's garden.

To calculate the total number of fruits, we need to consider the yield of each plant type. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, each yielding 22 tomatoes, and 8 eggplant plants, each yielding 4 eggplants.

Total tomatoes = 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Total eggplants = 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

The total number of fruits in Ricardo's garden is the sum of the total tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.

The final answer is: 142"
"As an expert in sales analysis, I can break down the problem into its components to determine the number of OLED TVs sold.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we can calculate the temperature difference between the day and night, and then divide that by the heating capacity of one log.

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the heating capacity of one log:

12 / 5 = 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. However, in this case, we can use the ceiling function to find the minimum number of logs needed. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest whole number.

The minimum number of logs needed is ⌈12 / 5⌉ = 3.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we need to calculate the number of groups that had members bring back seashells and multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

Number of seashells = Number of groups * Number of seashells per group
= 3/5 * 10 * 2
= 3/5 * 20
= 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells collected is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train, we can follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"Let's dive into the world of bottle cap economics. As a numerical analyst, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Damien's daily earnings can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottle caps he finds per day (10) by the value of each bottle cap ($0.25). This gives us:

10 bottle caps/day × $0.25/bottle cap = $2.50/day

To find out how much Damien makes in a 30-day month, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in the month:

$2.50/day × 30 days = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which can be calculated as:

$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour

The total earnings for the additional hours are:

3 hours * $30/hour = $90

To find the total earnings for the day, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours:

$160 + $90 = $250

"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in animal behavior and enclosure management, I can confidently calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure.

To determine the total number of lions, we need to consider the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = 12 (female lions) / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to find 25% of the original price and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. To find 25% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.25.

$40 x 0.25 = $10

The discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

The salary per employee is $4000 per month. To calculate the total salary paid per month, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid per month = 260 employees * $4000 = $1,040,000

To find the total salary paid after three months, we multiply the total salary paid per month by the number of months:

Total salary paid after 3 months = $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000

The final answer is: $3,120,000"
"As a music enthusiast and a color theorist, I can assure you that the total caroling time can be calculated by adding the time for each song.

The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, which is 2 x 150 seconds. This equals 300 seconds.

Additionally, they will sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is 240 seconds.

To find the total time, we add the times together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total caroling time is 540 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate Billy's hourly wage after the two raises. Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can use simple arithmetic. 

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6. 
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

The difference in cost is $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

"To find the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Pierson's score = 278
Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139
Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150

Now, let's add their scores together:
Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the number of students and teachers participating in the reforestation campaign.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. This gives us a total of 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Additionally, there are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. As each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and set up an equation to find the number of goats that will make up 30% of her total collection.

Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. Let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the equation:

Number of stuffed goats / Total number of stuffed animals = 0.3

Let x be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

x / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 4.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 4.2 / 0.7
x = 6

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming sessions into two parts: the first 2 weeks and the last week.

In the first 2 weeks, Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays for 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

In the last week, Kris plays for 2 hours per day. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays for 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

Total hours played = 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The final answer is: 9"
"When two cars are traveling at different speeds on a highway, the distance between them can be determined by considering their relative motion. In this scenario, the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling faster, it will cover more distance in the same time frame. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = Relative Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to find the cost of the premium. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To calculate the overall pass rate, we need to find the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of Milo's mosaic, we need to calculate the total area of the mosaic and then divide it by the height. Since the area of a rectangle is length * width, and we know the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'b', the number of chips per bag as 'c', and the number of chips per square inch as 's'. We are given that b = 2, c = 72, and s = 12.

First, we calculate the total number of chips: b * c = 2 * 72 = 144.

Next, we find the total area of the mosaic: total area = total chips / chips per square inch = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the height is 3 inches, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height: length = total area / height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we need to calculate the total amount consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 candies, he now has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies: 200 - 50 = 150.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 more candies to sell all of his candy.

Final Answer: The final answer is 150."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can model this growth using the formula:

Number of students at the end of the year = 10 * 2^12

where 10 is the initial number of students and 2^12 represents the doubling of students at the end of each month.

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of students at the end of the year = 10 * 2^12
= 10 * 4096
= 40,960

Since we want to find the number of additional students by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the total:

Additional students = 40,960 - 10
= 40,950

The final answer is: 40,950"
"As a tree climbing expert, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we can divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate the total number of petals in the vase, we need to consider the number of petals from each type of flower and account for the ones dropped.

Let's break it down:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type, we need to subtract the total number of petals dropped (5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals) from the total picked.

Total petals in the vase: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

The final answer is: 79"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is equal to the total number of marshmallows.

Total marshmallows = 35
Total S'mores = 35

However, they dropped 3 marshmallows, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Now, we know that John and DeSean made a total of 18 S'mores (9 each). To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the remaining marshmallows by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

Since we are not given any options, we will present the answer in the required format.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money used, we need to determine the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's break down the time each person played:

- Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
- The friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.
- The other friend also plays for 120 minutes, so they will use 6 quarters.
- The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"As a skilled perfumer and formulator, I can break down the problem step by step to determine the amount of oil used in Tanya's salt scrub recipe.

Let's denote the amount of salt used as x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is also x ounces.

Given that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. This means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.2). This gives us 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find the number of cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from the number he had after selling: 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"Let's dive into the world of Magic Card collections. As a card enthusiast, I'm excited to help you solve this problem.

We're given that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 Magic Cards. We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of cards:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We know that Cindy had 5 green eggs, so G = 5.

We also know that she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so B = 2G = 2(5) = 10.

Additionally, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so Y = P/3 = 9/3 = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs of each color together:
Total = G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the amount Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:

"As a mountain lifting expert, I can break down the problem step by step to find the height Naruto can lift.

First, we know that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. Then, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. Next, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, resulting in a total of 4 * 12 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, which gives us 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, we can represent Rory's dishes as 20 + 20 = 40.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so we can represent Jada's dishes as 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of clay dishes, we add the number of dishes each one made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80 to help her. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then subtract the number of slices Adam ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate (15 slices) from the total number of slices: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

The number of apple slices left is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the number of cows needed as x. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the equation:

5x = 25

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

Since the glue sticks are partially used, we can calculate the length of the used part and subtract it from the original length to find the length of the unused part.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we can use simple subtraction. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Gabriel has: $5000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200.

Next, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Final answer: $5600"
"When calculating change, it's essential to consider the total amount given and the price of the item. In this case, Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which equals $80. The price of the hat is $70.

To find the change, we subtract the price of the hat from the total amount given:

$80 - $70 = $10

Thea received $10 in change.

Final Answer: The final answer is $10."
"Let's break down Craig's expenses to determine how much money he has left.

Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is a total of $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and has twice as many dishes as socks. To find the number of socks Jack has, we can divide 60 by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply 30 by 2 to find the number of socks Peter has:

30 × 2 = 60 socks

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together:

60 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 120 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can set up an equation to find the number of socks Jack has:

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 's'. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, the number of dishes Jack has is 2s. We know that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can set up the equation:

2s = 60

To solve for 's', we can divide both sides by 2:

s = 60 ÷ 2
s = 30

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of dishes he has:

2s = 2(30)
= 60 dishes

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of dishes they have together:

60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 20 students in total. We also know that 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only. To find the number of students good at both math and English, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Number of students good at math or English = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only + Number of students good at both math and English

Since we know the total number of students and the number of students good at math only and English only, we can rearrange the equation to find the number of students good at both math and English:

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - Number of students good at math only - Number of students good at English only

Number of students good at both math and English = 20 - 5 - 8
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time and subtract the time taken by each group.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to consider the 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total available time is:

Total available time = 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes

The time taken by each group is 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage). To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the total available time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time taken by each group
= 130 minutes / 10 minutes
= 13

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Vicki can accommodate 13 groups in the concert.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we need to calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we can calculate the total amount after 3 years:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = P + Interest = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = P + Interest = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: 30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"As an agricultural economist, I can provide a detailed analysis of the farmer's situation.

To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the number of trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the selling price per tray:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have two farms, Farm X and Farm Y, with initial goat populations of 55 and 45, respectively. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y.

To find the number of goats left in Farm X, we subtract the number of goats sold from the initial population:
55 - 10 = 45

Since Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, we multiply the number of goats sold from Farm Y by 2:
2 x 10 = 20

Now, we subtract the number of goats sold from Farm Y from its initial population:
45 - 20 = 25

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the number of goats left in each farm:
45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

The final answer is: 70"
"To calculate the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can use the formula:

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs per month, we can first calculate the total number of pairs bought per year:

Number of pairs bought per year = 2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Now, we can calculate the average cost per pair:

Average cost per pair = $2640 / 24 pairs/year
= $110

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $110."
"To calculate the total cost of the food baskets, we need to consider the cost of both green and red food. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the $2 discount per basket:
3 * $18 = $54
$54 - $6 = $48 (discounted cost)

Now, we'll add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can use the formula:

Time = (Number of rooms / 2) * Time per room

Given that there are 90 rooms and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = (90 / 2) * 20
Time = 45 * 20
Time = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 900 / 60
Time = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break it down into three parts.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the following information:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then:
- Your brother's age is x + 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 2.
- Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We can re-express the equation as 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try different values of x to satisfy the equation.

Let's try x = 15: 
- Your age is 15.
- Your brother's age is 15 + 3 = 18.
- Your sister's age is 15 - 2 = 13.
- Your mom's age is 3(18) - 1 = 53.

The sum of your ages is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 14: 
- Your age is 14.
- Your brother's age is 14 + 3 = 17.
- Your sister's age is 14 - 2 = 12.
- Your mom's age is 3(17) - 1 = 50.

The sum of your ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 
- Your age is 13.
- Your brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16.
- Your sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11.
- Your mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of your ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

The solution to the problem is x = 13.

"As a hydrologist specializing in river flow analysis, I can provide a precise calculation for the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

Given that the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day, we can calculate the amount of water on the third day as follows:

Initial amount of water on the first day = 4000 gallons
Amount of water on the second day = 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons
Amount of water on the third day = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

Final answer: 14000"
"The problem at hand involves a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled using the exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * (r^t), where N0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time period.

In this scenario, the initial population (N0) is 10, and the growth rate (r) is 6, as each infected person infects 6 others. We are interested in finding the total population after 3 days (t = 3).

Using the formula, we can calculate the population after 3 days as follows:

N(3) = 10 * (6^3)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rafaela received 40 tips of $20 each, so we can calculate the total amount of tips she received. This can be expressed as:

Total tips for Rafaela = Number of customers * Tip amount per customer
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 * $20
Total tips for Rafaela = $800

Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can calculate her total tips by finding 90% of Rafaela's total tips. This can be expressed as:

Total tips for Julieta = 0.9 * Total tips for Rafaela
Total tips for Julieta = 0.9 * $800
Total tips for Julieta = $720

To find the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we add their individual totals:

Total tips for both = Total tips for Rafaela + Total tips for Julieta
Total tips for both = $800 + $720
Total tips for both = $1520

"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can use simple subtraction. 

Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. She distributed them as follows: 3 daughters received 2 oranges each, and her son received 3 oranges. 

The total number of oranges given away can be calculated by adding the number of oranges each child received: 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges, plus the 3 oranges given to her son, totaling 9 oranges.

Now, subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Claire earns 1 badge per month, and Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire's badges per year: 1 * 12 = 12 badges
Wendy's badges per year: 3 * 12 = 36 badges

Now, let's find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. We know that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

Wendy's extra badges compared to Amber: 36 - 6 = 30 badges

"Let's dive into the world of coin counting and solve the problem.

We know that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she has 70 gold coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x. The number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. Since we know the number of gold coins is 70, we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To calculate the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first determine the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, we can calculate this as 50 * 10 = 500 burritos.

However, Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos given to the students. This can be represented as 500 - 20 = 480 burritos.

"The bumper car rink's color distribution is a fascinating topic, and I'm excited to dive into it. As a color enthusiast, I must say that yellow is an excellent choice for a bumper car, don't you agree?

To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars. Since the rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
= 12 - 2
= 10

Next, we know that the number of blue cars is three times the number of green cars:

Number of blue cars = 3 * Number of green cars
= 3 * 10
= 30

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

Total number of red, green, and blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30
= 52

Since the total number of cars is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:

Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - Total number of red, green, and blue cars
= 75 - 52
= 23

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x.

Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can express Anne's books as x - 12. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie's books can be represented as (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13.

The total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

"To determine Keenan's weekly grocery expenditure, we need to calculate his monthly expenditure first. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find Keenan's monthly expenditure, we multiply the total expenditure by 0.4 (which represents 40%):

$400 * 0.4 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4 to find his weekly expenditure:

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

The final answer is $40."
"To calculate the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to break down his consumption over the three days.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find this, we multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = 24

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find this, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"
"To calculate the total cost of the items David wants to buy, we need to multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $8.00 = $16.00

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To calculate the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Bolts * Cost per Bolt
Total Cost = 16 * $0.03
Total Cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining Amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"As a canine behaviorist, I can provide a straightforward calculation to determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking.

To find Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the hourly rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings:

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

Therefore, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him 28 marbles. This can be represented as:

Initial marbles + marbles given by friend = Total marbles
52 + 28 = 80

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total marbles, which can be calculated as:

1/4 × 80 = 20

Since Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles, we subtract the lost marbles from the total:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to consider the weighted points for each type of question. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, while the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions are 8.

Next, we calculate the points from the true/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points. Again, each true/false question is worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions are 18.

Lastly, we calculate the points from the long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions are 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we need to calculate the total cost of the 180 chickens Isaias plans to sell. Since he wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling them at $50 each, we can set up an equation:

Total Revenue = Total Cost + Profit
$50 * 180 = Total Cost + $2000

Simplifying the equation:
$9000 = Total Cost + $2000
Total Cost = $9000 - $2000
Total Cost = $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to find the difference between their sales. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3 to find the number of glasses each person sold.

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, we can find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to determine the cost of each service and add them together.

The cost of the hair service is $400.

The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the hair service, which is 1/4 * $400 = $100.

The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the manicure, which is 3/4 * $100 = $75.

Now, let's add the costs together: $400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. Since her age will be thrice her present age in a certain number of years, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 3x

where 'y' is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 2x

Since Melanie's present age is 8 years, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

y = 2(8)
y = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"
"Let's break down the costs of the items in Kelly's cart.

The cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

To find the total cost, we add up the individual costs:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Since Kelly's budget is $65, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the total runtime of the final concert as 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime without the encore is 2x - 15. Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x - 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can add 15 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 + 15
2x = 80

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 40 minutes.

The final answer is: 40"
"To find out how many toys Argo has now, we need to subtract the number of toys he gave away from the total number of toys he had initially.

Initial number of toys: 200
Toys given away: 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150

Number of toys Argo has now: 200 - 150 = 50

Argo has 50 toys now."
"The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop's production of chimichangas can be analyzed using basic arithmetic operations. To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit in pairs. 

Let's denote the total number of microphones as 'T'. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that won't fit is 0.2 * T. 

The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is T - 0.2T = 0.8T. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 0.8T / 2 = 0.4T.

We know that T = 50. Therefore, the number of pairs is 0.4 * 50 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total number of birds, we need to break down the information into separate components and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to get the total:

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the number of cookies in each jar, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of jars.

"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals on each type of flower.

The number of petals on an orchid is 5, and there are 5 orchids. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The number of petals on a daisy is 10, and there are 4 daisies. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is 10 * 4 = 40 petals.

To find the difference, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) * 100 = 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Next, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants. This can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 75 = 50

Finally, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"The problem at hand involves determining the speed of a whirligig based on its relationship to the speed of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit. As a color theorist, I must admit that my expertise lies in the realm of color properties and their applications, but I'll apply my analytical skills to this problem.

Given that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can establish a ratio of their speeds. Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is 11x.

We're told that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. To find the speed of the thingamabob, we can set up the equation: 
11x = 121 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. 
Speed of whirligig = 5 * 11 
Speed of whirligig = 55 meters per second 

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"Let's break down Ellen's daily expenses. We know she spends $6 on a salad and $3 on yogurt, as the yogurt is half the price of the salad. The total cost of these two items is $6 + $3 = $9.

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots can be found by subtracting the cost of the salad and yogurt from her total daily expenditure. 

Cost of carrots = Total daily expenditure - (Cost of salad + Cost of yogurt)
= $11 - ($6 + $3)
= $11 - $9
= $2

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"Let's break down Mark's new weekly earnings. 

Mark's new hourly wage is $12, and he works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. To find his weekly earnings, we multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked per day and the number of days worked per week.

Weekly earnings = (hourly wage) * (hours/day) * (days/week)
Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

So, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"The problem at hand involves determining the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. To solve this, we need to analyze the information provided about her lawn-mowing activities.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is $6x, as Joe paid her $6 for his lawn. We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can follow the given information step by step.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"

Total earnings per month: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750
Total profit per month: $750 - $500 (car payment) = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph. If we let x be the number of notebooks Joseph had, then Martha had 3x notebooks. We are also given that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph had 2/3 notebooks, we can find the difference between Martha's and Joseph's notebooks. Martha had 7 notebooks, and Joseph had 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2/3 = 7 - 0.67
= 6.33

So, Martha has 6.33 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: 6.33"
"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can represent Anis' distance as 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 times Dijana's distance.

Let's denote Dijana's distance as x. Then, Anis' distance can be represented as (6/5)x.

We know that Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis' distance:
Anis' distance = (6/5)x
Anis' distance = (6/5)(50)
Anis' distance = 60

To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we can add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. Since we're dealing with a simple division problem, we can use the formula:

Cookies per nephew = Total remaining cookies / Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 ÷ 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is 16."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. This means the difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday is 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 23 pages (10 + 13). So, Denise read 18 - 23 = -5 pages more than Daniel.

However, since we can't have a negative number of pages, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. Let's recheck the calculation: Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. To find the difference, we need to subtract 23 from 18, which gives us -5. This means Denise actually read 5 fewer pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $-5$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the total number of bowls available and the number of bowls consumed for dinner.

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults, he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner.

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total cost, we can use the formula:

Therefore, William spent $8 in total."
"To calculate the total material needed for the face masks, we need to determine the amount required for both small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we know that 4 small masks can be made from 2 yards of material. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = x yards
20 / 4 = x / 2
5 = x / 2
x = 5 * 2
x = 10 yards

For large masks, we know that 3 large masks can be made from 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = x yards
8 / 3 = x / 2.25
(8 * 2.25) / 3 = x
18 / 3 = x
x = 6 yards

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the average price per ticket, we can use the formula:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

Given that Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre three times, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Total amount spent = $216

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

To find the average price per ticket, we can perform the division:

$216 ÷ 27 = $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the total marbles given away and subtract that from the initial amount.

Dean gave 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. Since he has 30 marbles, we can calculate 1/5 of 30 as follows:

1/5 * 30 = 6

So, Dean gave 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the total:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can represent this information using a mathematical equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

To solve for Adam's current age, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 60 / 2
x = 30

Now that we know Adam's current age, we can find his age in 8 years by adding 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

"To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"As a packaging expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Colby's earnings.

To calculate Colby's daily earnings, we need to multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day. Since he completes 40 packages per hour and works for 8 hours, his total packages completed in a day is 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

Given that he earns $0.20 for every package, his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * $0.20 = $64.

"To calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to determine the total time spent on sudoku puzzles and then divide it by the time interval between each bottle.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

However, since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. We also know that there were 20 red balloons and a total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown.

First, we can find the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons: 2 * 20 = 40.

Since the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.

Now, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3: 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can use a simple division problem. Since Jon drives 100 miles a day and his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the total number of tune-ups as follows:

Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / 1000 miles/tune-up
= 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up
= 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total hours worked by Bruce, we need to calculate the hours worked each day. 

First, we know Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. Then, he works twice the time on Wednesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so it's 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

The cost of the cake is $11, and the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6. The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira bought, we can simply add the quantities of each type of fruit.

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we need to subtract 2 from the total.

14 - 2 = 12

There are 12 pieces of fruit left."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, which is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The number of students playing soccer is given as 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students in each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised from selling lollipops, we need to consider the number of lollipops sold and the profit per lollipop.

The number of lollipops sold can be calculated by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold. In this case, there are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops.

Number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student
= 300 lollipops

The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. The selling price is $0.8 per lollipop, and the cost price is $0.5 per lollipop.

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Now, we can calculate the total profit by multiplying the number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop.

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 lollipops * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"As an animal care expert, I can break down the information provided to calculate the total number of pets Larry has.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, we can calculate the number of dogs as 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're told he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

Moving on to the fish tank, Larry has three times the number of fish as rabbits, which gives us 3 * 7 = 21 fish.

Lastly, his gerbil collection is 1/3 the number of fish, resulting in 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47 pets.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"Let's calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected. Since she collects one shell per month, we can simply multiply the number of years she has been collecting shells by 12.

Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years. To find the total number of shells, we multiply the number of years by 12:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows. 

Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 rows: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Therefore, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the time constraint of 8 hours and the time it takes for the sloth to make a round trip (4 hours). 

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can divide the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2) to find the number of berries he can pick per trip.

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days and subtract it from the initial amount in the tank.

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:
500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

The initial amount of water in the tank is 5000 gallons. After 6 days, the amount of water remaining in the tank will be:
5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

The final answer is: 2000"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses to determine how many movies he can see.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"As a pastry nutrition expert, I can help you calculate the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked.

To find the total calories of the pastries, we need to calculate the calories of each mini pastry and then add them together.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so a mini cinnamon roll has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so a mini blueberry muffin has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus traveled at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. Using the formula for distance (Distance = Speed * Time), we can calculate the distance the bus traveled:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car traveled at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance the car traveled:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 
Blocks = 31
Stuffed animals = 8
Rings = 9

Total initial toys = Blocks + Stuffed animals + Rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Since Sophie now has a total of 62 toys, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total initial toys from the current total:
Bouncy balls = Total current toys - Total initial toys
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"Let's dive into the problem of finding Peter's age.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages.

Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J. We can write the equation for the combined age as:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Simplifying the equation, we get:

P = P + J + 10

Subtracting P from both sides:

0 = J + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiplying both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:

P + J = 90
P + (-10) = 90

Subtracting -10 from both sides:

P = 100

So, Peter's age is 100.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each. To find the total number of balloons, we can multiply the number of friends by the number of balloons each friend received:

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Maria also had 1 balloon for herself, so we add that to the total:

8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), we multiply the number of people by the number of additional balloons:

5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Now, we add the initial 9 balloons to the additional 15 balloons:

9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. Since 10 people donated 5 boxes each, we can calculate the total number of donated boxes as follows:

10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes

Adding the existing boxes, we get:

50 boxes + 10 boxes = 60 boxes

Since each table can hold 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2:

60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables

However, the charity group already has 15 tables. To find the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed:

30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated items.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney, then divide by 2.

Zoey's total distance spat is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet. 
Sydney's total distance spat is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"As a financial analyst specializing in widget production and sales, I've crunched the numbers to determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000.

To calculate the total revenue from each machine, we need to consider the number of widgets produced and the selling price of each widget. Let's break it down:

Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in total revenue, we subtract the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To calculate the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to consider the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours beyond that. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. Since Cameron stays for 5 hours beyond the 12-hour mark, we need to calculate the cost of these additional hours.

The cost of the additional hours is 5 hours x 70 pesos per hour = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To determine how much Cameron would save by choosing the extended stay option instead of the 24-hour stay, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can calculate the amount of hay each animal requires and then sum them up.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which is 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. Since he earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, his total earnings are:

50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, he spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends a total of:

5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, he has:

250 - 50 = 200 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:

200 - 100 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25:

100 / 25 = 4

Therefore, John can buy 4 pens with the remaining money.

The final answer is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Craig spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

20 words * 15 letters = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total:

300 + 50 = 350

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."

"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we need to calculate the total number of bottles given to the students and subtract that from the total number of bottles the teacher can get.

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles the teacher can get is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.

There are 29 pupils in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher can get:
900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"As a plumbing expert, I can confidently calculate the total cost of the job. To determine the total cost, we need to consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts.

The fixed charge is $40, and the labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). This gives us:

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The total cost of parts is $60.

To find the total cost, we add the labor cost, the fixed charge, and the cost of parts:

Total cost = Labor cost + Fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially purchased 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of $150. Since he received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

The total cost after the discount is:

Total cost after discount = Total cost of CDs - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $150 - $60
Total cost after discount = $90

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of:

Total revenue from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total revenue from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total revenue from selling CDs = $200

To determine how much James was out, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost after the discount:

Amount James was out = Total cost after discount - Total revenue from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $90 - $200
Amount James was out = -$110

Since James was out $110, he actually lost $110.

Final answer: $110"

"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be represented as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact value of x as 110/7.

Now, we can find the number of loaves the bakery has by substituting the value of x into the expression 7x - 40:

Number of loaves = 7 * (110/7) - 40
= 110 - 40
= 70

The bakery has 70 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Marcus's age as M, and Deanna's age as D.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21.

Additionally, Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = L/2.

Substituting the value of M into the second equation, we get 21 = L/2.

To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in L = 2 * 21 = 42.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

42"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can represent Bahati's score as (x + 20). We know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can also represent Bahati's score as (x + 10).

We are given that the total points scored by all three is 45. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3

x = 18.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the exact value of x as a fraction.

Now, we can find Azibo's score by substituting the value of x into the expression (x + 10):

Azibo's score = (18.33 + 10)
= 28.33

However, since we are dealing with whole points, we can express Azibo's score as a whole number. We can round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can express the exact value of Azibo's score as a fraction.

Azibo's score = (55/3) + 10
= (55 + 30)/3
= 85/3
= 28.33

Since we are dealing with whole points, we can express Azibo's score as a whole number.

Azibo's score = 28.33 ≈ 28

However, since we are asked to provide the exact numerical value, we can express Azibo's score as a fraction.

Azibo's score = 85/3

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{85}{3}}$"

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we need to determine the total minutes he worked and then divide that by the time it takes him to staple 30 reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 15 hours by 60.

Total minutes = 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to consider the time she spent sleepwalking and her early morning wake-up.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.:

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. = 3 hours 22 minutes = 182 minutes

Now, let's add up the minutes:
120 + 135 + 23 + 182 = 460 minutes

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract 5 minutes from the total:
460 - 5 = 455 minutes

The final answer is: 455"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has two dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has. Two dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24 cups.

To find 2/3 of 24 cups, we can multiply 24 by 2 and then divide by 3:
(2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons initially. He gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so he is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons, so the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 + 10 = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to consider the initial capacity and the daily admissions.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied, which means there are 100 occupied beds. The number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 100 = 900 beds.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 x 14 = 700 patients.

To find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds:
900 - 700 = 200 beds

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of non-work emails:
Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family:
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we find the number of emails to her boyfriend:
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aliya is 3 years old. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, we need to find Shawna's father's age. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number. 

First, let's calculate 20% of 48. To do this, we multiply 48 by 0.20.

48 * 0.20 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48 to find the correct number of people who attended the concert.

48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up an equation to find Jeffrey's balls:

Jason's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
2 = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jeffrey's balls = 1

Now, we can find Jordan's balls by multiplying Jeffrey's balls by 2:

Jordan's balls = 2 * Jeffrey's balls
Jordan's balls = 2 * 1
Jordan's balls = 2

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:

Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 2 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's dive into the world of treasure hunting and excavation. As a geologist, I'll break down the problem step by step.

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). To find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day, we can simply add these values:

10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 × Total holes by the end of the third day
116 = 4 × 29

To find the total number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can subtract the total holes dug by the end of the third day from the total holes by the end of the fourth day:

Total holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes by the end of the third day
= 116 - 29
= 87 holes

The final answer is: 87"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we can use the information given. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the others got as x. Then, Collins got x + 15. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + (x + 15) = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 155 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 77.5. However, since we can't have half a corn chip, this is an issue. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the information. If Collins got 15 more than the others, and Amora and Lainey got 70 each, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15 = 85. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + 85 = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 225 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 75. Now, we can find the total number of corn chips by multiplying x by 3: 3 * 75 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To calculate the cost of the travel, we need to determine 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply by 0.5.

50% of $400 = 0.5 x $400 = $200

The cost of travel is the sum of the cost of supplies and 50% of the cost of supplies.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"A Pokémon conundrum! Let's dive into the world of Pokémon catching and unravel the mystery of the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.

We're given that the total number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. We also know that Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan, and Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We can represent the given information as a system of equations:

1. A + S + X = 339
2. X = S + 5
3. S = 4A - 13

To solve for S, we can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:

A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. To find the total number of episodes, we can divide the total minutes per episode by 2.

Total minutes per episode = 20
Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, to find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the total number of episodes by the total minutes per episode.

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can use the concept of displacement. Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object. In this case, the bird's initial position is the northern home, and the final position is the southern home.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
d1 = speed × time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
d2 = speed × time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
d3 = speed × time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net displacement is:
d = d1 - d2 = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can represent this as 12.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies at the office party. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1/2 by 12, which equals 6. So, she received 6 brownies at the office party.

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home. Again, 1 dozen equals 12, so 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Now, we add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 to a whole number, we multiply 1 by 12 and add 1/2 * 12, which equals 12 + 6 = 18. So, 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To calculate the total age of the family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: 30"
"As a tennis pro shop expert, I can break down the task into manageable components to determine the total time required to string all the racquets.

Time for synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Time for polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Time for hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{227}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, the cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"

"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats needed:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she had initially: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find the number of oranges she sold: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"When comparing the number of states in India and the USA, we need to consider the correct relationship between the two countries. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. To find the total number of states in both countries, we can calculate the number of states in the USA first. 

The number of states in the USA is 50. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to this gives us 25 + 4 = 29 states in India.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the saved amount from the total cost:

$39 - $14 = $25

To find the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage of $5:

Number of hours = $25 ÷ $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we need to calculate the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie sales separately and then add them together.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 per box, resulting in earnings of 10 * $6 = $60. He also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, which means he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie. At $15 per box, his earnings from apple pie sales on Saturday were 6 * $15 = $90.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. His earnings from gingerbread sales on Sunday were 15 * $6 = $90. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, resulting in earnings of 15 * $15 = $225.

To find the total earnings for the two days, we add the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie sales: $60 + $90 + $90 + $225 = $465.

The final answer is: $465"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, we can multiply the number of hours she will be outside by 1 (since she reappplies 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour).

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours
Total ounces needed = 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle to find the number of bottles she will need:
Number of bottles = Total ounces needed / Ounces per bottle
= 32 ounces / 8 ounces
= 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"When calculating the price of the red car, we need to find 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

The price of the blue car is $100. To find 40% of this amount, we multiply $100 by 0.4.

$100 x 0.4 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Emil is currently 19 years old. We can represent his current age as E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation 24 = D/2, where D represents his dad's age. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation 24 = 2B, where B represents his brother's age. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12. The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of beads, we need to add the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend. 

The total number of beads = 20 (from her mother) + (20 + 10) (from her sister) + (2 * 20) (from her friend)
The total number of beads = 20 + 30 + 40
The total number of beads = 90

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we can break it down by day:

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

The total amount of crawfish caught is the sum of the amounts caught each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

The length of the flower bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 1332 inches. Since each plant is 12 inches wide and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, the total space required for each plant and the space between them is 12 + 18 = 30 inches.

Now, we can calculate the number of plants Pat can fit in the bed: 1332 / 30 = 44.4. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 27 * 6 = $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. We know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so in a week, he eats 18 * 7 = 126 pretzels. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up the proportion:

x / 126 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 126 * 1/2
x = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

"When potting flowers, it's essential to consider the specific needs of each plant variety. In this case, we're dealing with roses, carnations, and sunflowers. Let's break down the soil requirements for each type of flower.

Roses require 1 pound of soil per plant, carnations need 1.5 pounds, and sunflowers need 3 pounds. We're given that they have a 30-pound bag of soil and want to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds = 15 pounds

Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Now, subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. This can be calculated as:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500 per month

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate the number of pairs she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a single pair:

$500 per month ÷ $1,000 per pair = 0.5 pairs per month

To find the total number of pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12:

0.5 pairs per month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the task into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the peeling rate:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Peeling rate
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the cooking rate:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Cooking rate
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 30
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 3 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by adding the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cook:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
Total time = 15 minutes + 3 minutes
Total time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room an additional 3 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled an additional 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. The room will warm up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The final temperature difference from the starting temperature is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect: Final temperature difference = Total cooling effect - Warming effect = 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(x + 30). Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 30) = 90

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 90 = 90

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill was born by adding 30 to x, which is 30 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(30 + 30) = 3(60) = 180 years old. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet by subtracting 30 from 180, which is 150 years old.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he was born by subtracting 30 from 150, which is 120 years old.

The final answer is 120."
"As a financial analyst, I've broken down Buford's check-writing habits to provide an accurate calculation.

To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check. 

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"Let's break down the information given to determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France.

We know the first plane makes a total of 88 trips. Since 3/4 of its flights are to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as 3/4 * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we subtract the flights to Greece from the total number of flights: 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is half of 22, which is 22 / 2 = 11.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined length of time for the howls of three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. To approach this, we need to understand the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know the total age of the children is 20, and the average age is 5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can set up the equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age:

W = 20 - 3 - 4 - H
W = 20 - 3 - 4 - 10
W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Walter initially collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, totaling $2000. His lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. To find the amount the lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate three times the total amount collected so far.

Total amount collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

However, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which will be subtracted from the total amount collected. This means the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we need to calculate the total number of cookies given to the church and then divide that by the number of cookies each person received.

The bride gave half of the total cookies to the church, which is 1/2 of 1500 cookies. 

Number of cookies given to the church = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To divide a watermelon among a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) such that each adult gets a slice twice as big as that of each kid, we can use the concept of proportional division.

Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Since each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, the number of slices for the adults is 2x.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults, which is x + 2x = 3x. Since there are 6 people in total, we can set up the equation: 3x = 6.

Solving for x, we get x = 2. This means the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"As a medical scheduling expert, I can help Doctor Jones optimize his time allocation. To determine the time left for updating records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to consider the total time required to complete each step and add them up.

The total time for making the cake is the sum of the time for each step: 
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can use the total number of boxes sold and the total number of chocolate bars sold. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars sold can be represented as 8x = 64.

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

8x = 64
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it is rented 3 days a week. To find the weekly cost, we multiply the cost per session by the number of days: $25 * 3 = $75 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. The weekly cost of students' lessons is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. The monthly cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.

Final Answer: The final answer is $480."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as 'x'. Since Peter has 4 boxes, his total number of chocolate bars is 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so her total number of chocolate bars is 7x.

We are given that Peter has 64 chocolate bars and Martha has 56 chocolate bars. We can set up the following equations:

4x = 64
7x = 56

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of each equation by the respective number of boxes:

x = 64 / 4
x = 56 / 7

x = 16
x = 8

Since we are looking for the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can subtract the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter:

16 - 8 = 8

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: 8"
"As a wildlife biologist specializing in rodent populations, I can provide a detailed analysis of the porcupine population growth.

To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the initial population and the birth rate. Given that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * 50 = 30

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the monthly birth rate by 12:

Total new porcupines per year = 120 * 12 = 1440

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:

Total porcupines after a year = Initial population + Total new porcupines per year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the pool's dimensions: Length = 25 feet, Width = 14 feet, and Depth = 4 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 25 x 14 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"In the world of pick-up sticks, I'm delighted to share my expertise on the color yellow, which, in my opinion, is the brightest and most vibrant color.

To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of blue and yellow sticks first. 

The number of red sticks is given as 9. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, the number of blue sticks can be calculated as:
Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so:
Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

Now, let's calculate the total number of sticks:
Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

For Shandy, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into two groups: students over 16 years old and students under 16 years old.

First, let's calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we can calculate this as:

Number of students over 16 = Total students / 2
= 3000 / 2
= 1500

Now, we know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. To find the number of male students over 16, we can calculate:

Number of male students over 16 = (1/4) × Number of students over 16
= (1/4) × 1500
= 375

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16:

Number of female students over 16 = Number of students over 16 - Number of male students over 16
= 1500 - 375
= 1125

Next, we calculate the number of students under 16. Since half of the students are under 16, we can calculate this as:

Number of students under 16 = Total students / 2
= 3000 / 2
= 1500

Now, we know that one-half of the students under 16 are male. To find the number of male students under 16, we can calculate:

Number of male students under 16 = (1/2) × Number of students under 16
= (1/2) × 1500
= 750

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16:

Number of female students under 16 = Number of students under 16 - Number of male students under 16
= 1500 - 750
= 750

Finally, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students:

Total number of female students = Number of female students over 16 + Number of female students under 16
= 1125 + 750
= 1875

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their lap counts.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can express Trey's lap count as 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, we find Shaelyn's lap count by dividing Trey's lap count by 2, which gives us 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Lastly, we calculate Quinn's lap count by subtracting 2 from Shaelyn's lap count, resulting in 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, to find the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's dive into the problem of filling a tank with water.

We have a tank with a capacity of 18,000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B are working together to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the charge remaining in the power bank over time. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

This equation still doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem again.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment, we need to find 20% of the cost of the car. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: 2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The prices are as follows:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:
3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
4 pears * $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis * $1 = $2
5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent so far = $1.50 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has spent more than he has, we need to recalculate the total amount he has left:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result)

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to calculate the total number of pieces given away and then divide it by the number of friends.

First, we find the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs Anne kept from the total number of packs:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"As a seasoned expert in pricing analysis, I can confidently calculate the price increase of carrots over three years. Given the initial price of $120, I'll apply the 5% annual increase to determine the final price.

Year 1: 
Price increase = 5% of $120 = 0.05 * $120 = $6
New price = $120 + $6 = $126

Year 2: 
Price increase = 5% of $126 = 0.05 * $126 = $6.30
New price = $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

Year 3: 
Price increase = 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * $132.30 = $6.615
New price = $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can use the information provided. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them into 8 albums. Since the number of pictures per album is the same, we can divide 72 by 8 to find the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The total number of portraits and selfies is the sum of these two values.

27 (selfies) + 18 (portraits) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use the concept of unit rates. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

Next, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. Therefore, the number of guests is now 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

The total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can break down the 60-question quiz as follows:

Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
Average and difficult questions: The remaining 60 - 24 = 36 questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so each type has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18 questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9 questions.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is 36."
"Let's dive into the world of stuffed animals and pricing. As a seasoned expert in the field of toy pricing, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the prices of large and small stuffed animals. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we can represent the price of a large stuffed animal as 3x, where x is the price of a small stuffed animal.

Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we can determine the price of a large stuffed animal: 3x = 3 * 4 = $12.

Now, let's consider the sales data. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so if she sold 's' number of large stuffed animals, she sold 2s number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, which gives us the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can use the formula:

Total sandwiches eaten per week = (sandwiches eaten per day) * (number of days in a week)

Given that the man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day, we can plug in the values as follows:

Total sandwiches eaten per week = (5 + 4 + 2) * 7
Total sandwiches eaten per week = 11 * 7
Total sandwiches eaten per week = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings step by step.

First, we need to calculate her earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80. 

Next, she sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240.

Now, we add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

However, she gave her two sisters $10 each, so we need to subtract the amount she gave them from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of eggs the friends found, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we subtract the number of eggs found by the twins (30) from the total number of eggs (100). This leaves us with 70 eggs. 

Since 10 eggs were not found, we can subtract these from the remaining 70 eggs to find the number of eggs the friends found.

Eggs found by friends = 70 - 10
= 60

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month. To approach this, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe compared to the iron pickaxe.

We know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf's efficiency increases to 24 pounds per day (twice the bare-hand rate). Furthermore, a steel pickaxe provides an additional 50% increase in efficiency over the iron pickaxe, resulting in 36 pounds of ore per day.

To find the total amount of ore mined per day by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we multiply the individual rate by the number of dwarves: 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

Now, we multiply this by 30 days to get the total amount of ore mined in a month: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: 43200"
"When analyzing the given information, we can observe that the prices of the sandwiches are proportional to the number of sandwiches in each package. This indicates a linear relationship between the number of sandwiches and the total cost.

Let's denote the price of the package with 8 sandwiches as x. Since the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, we can set up a proportion using the given information:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (4 sandwiches / $6) = (8 sandwiches / x)

We can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying:

2x = 3 * 4
2x = 12

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $6.

Final answer: $6"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom. This can be done by subtracting the amount received from the initial cost of the bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.

The final answer is: $200"
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons remaining after each event.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst:
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

The number of red balloons remaining is:
25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released:
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

The number of yellow balloons remaining is:
12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

Then, we calculate the number of blue balloons added:
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Finally, we calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:
15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem into its constituent parts. We have three scenarios to consider:

1. The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
2. The normal teacher comes in and gives an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 40% chance of getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
3. The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

To find the total probability, we add the probabilities of these scenarios: 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.8

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.8 * 100 = 80%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 80%.

Final answer: $\boxed{80\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to calculate the remaining seats after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish a relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans. This can be expressed as:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Since eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find the number of small beans:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans."
"As a juror compensation expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Melissa's hourly wage after expenses.

To calculate Melissa's hourly wage, we need to first determine her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Daily income: $15 per day
Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Since Melissa works for 3 days, her total income after expenses is $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage:
$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total amount Ted spent, we need to calculate the cost of the books and pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of 3 books at 16 dollars each is 3 x 16 = $48.
The cost of 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is 3 x 6 = $18.

Now, let's add the cost of the books and pencils together: $48 + $18 = $66.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of $66.

The final answer is: $66"
"To calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to determine the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To calculate the remaining amount of money Amor has to buy meat, we need to subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"As a financial analyst specializing in income and expenses, I'd be happy to help you calculate the time it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total amount of fabric needed for Jim's comforter, we must calculate the area of the comforter. 

The comforter's dimensions are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85. Adding 17 to that gives us 85 + 17 = 102.

Next, we need to find the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice Tuesday's delivery is 2 * 102 = 204. Adding 5 to that gives us 204 + 5 = 209.

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736.

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"

"To calculate the average amount lost, we need to consider the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

Let's break down the amount lost in each race:

1. The first race resulted in a loss of $5.
2. In the second race, the amount won was $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race. So, the amount won in the second race is $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
3. In the third race, the amount lost was 1.5 times the amount won in the second race. So, the amount lost in the third race is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."

Number of countries: 26
Number of cities per country: 5
Population per city: 1000

Total population = Number of countries * Number of cities per country * Population per city
Total population = 26 * 5 * 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we need to calculate their new heights.

Xavier's new height: 4 feet + 3 inches = 4 feet 3 inches = 51 inches
Cole's new height: 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height to find the difference:
52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch."
"To find the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x.

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760 / 3
x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To calculate the total hours worked by the team, we need to consider the fractional part of a day and convert it into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 3/8 by 24 to find the equivalent hours.

3/8 * 24 = 9 hours

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4) to find the hours worked per painter:

189 hours ÷ 4 painters = 47.25 hours/painter

"Let's dive into the world of tennis ball retrieval. As a tennis enthusiast, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^n

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can use the information provided. Since half of the books are written in English and 10% are written in German, the remaining books are written in Spanish.

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Total number of English and German books = 25 + 5 = 30

Since the total number of books is 50, the number of Spanish books can be found by subtracting the total number of English and German books from the total number of books.

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Total number of English and German books
= 50 - 30
= 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."

"Renovation Planning for Kitchen Floor

When it comes to calculating the cost of renovating a kitchen floor, we need to consider the total area of the floor and the cost of the tiles. 

The total area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet. Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, the area of each tile is 1 square foot. 

To find the total number of tiles required, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 
200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles

Now, we multiply the total number of tiles by the cost per tile to find the total cost:
200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"As a financial analyst specializing in insurance pricing, I can help James determine his annual insurance cost after an accident.

Given that the normal monthly cost is $120 and the accident resulted in a 60% increase, we can calculate the new monthly cost as follows:

New monthly cost = Normal monthly cost + (60% of normal monthly cost)
= $120 + (0.6 x $120)
= $120 + $72
= $192

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

Annual cost = New monthly cost x 12
= $192 x 12
= $2304

Therefore, James will pay $2304 per year for insurance.

The final answer is: $2304"
"To calculate the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to consider the washing capacity of his laundry machine. Since it can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week as follows:

Number of twin loads per week = 4 beds * 52 weeks / 2 = 104 loads
Number of king loads per week = 1 bed * 52 weeks / 1 = 52 loads

Total loads per week = 104 + 52 = 156 loads

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can multiply the total loads per week by 52 to find the total number of loads per year:

Total loads per year = 156 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 8,112 loads

The final answer is: 8,112"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. To find the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
Total slices = 4 × 8
Total slices = 32

Now, let's focus on the information about Becky's and Jake's eating habits. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, and she ate 3 more slices than Jake. We can set up an equation to find out how many slices Jake ate:

Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3

To solve for Jake's slices, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

Jake's slices = 10 - 3
Jake's slices = 7

Now that we know Jake's slices, we can find Silvia's slices. Since Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can multiply Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2 × Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 × 7
Silvia's slices = 14

To find the total number of slices they ate, we can add up the slices each person ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to find the time taken by Betsy and Donovan. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The final answer is 58."
"As a medical billing specialist, I can break down the costs associated with Hannah's doctor visit.

The total cost of the doctor's visit can be calculated by adding the costs of each service:

1. The cost of the cast: $200
2. The cost of the visit: $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150
3. The cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $120
4. The cost of parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

James receives 80 emails per day, and 20% of those emails don't require a response. This means 80 - (20% of 80) emails require a response. 

20% of 80 is 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails that don't require a response. 

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"
"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can use the following steps:

Let's start by identifying the number of classes that visited each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 2 * 32 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: 3 * 32 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we can add up the number of classes that visited each day to find the total:

32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The final answer is: $\boxed{247}$"
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. In this case, John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80.

The sum of these scores is 380. To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 4.

Average score = Sum of scores / Number of tests
= 380 / 4
= 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"As a postal expert, I can help you calculate the total cost of postage for Anthony's pizza parlor.

To determine the total cost, we need to calculate the number of small and big coupons first. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, so he will send out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00.

The total cost of postage is $7.00 + $21.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Two hours after the trucks departed, it was discovered that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser.

To find the number of trucks that could not deliver, we can calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20
= 5

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:

5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. We know that 5 trucks could not deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is:

20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"As a pastry expert, I can help you calculate the total cost of butter for Dennis's croissant production.

Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. To find the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the number of dozen croissants by the amount of butter per dozen:

6 dozen croissants x 1 pound/baker's dozen = 6 pounds of butter

The grocery store has a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To calculate the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to consider the base rental fee and the additional guests. The base rental fee is $125 for a party of 20 guests. Since Kayla invited 41 guests in total, we need to calculate the number of additional guests.

Number of additional guests = Total guests - Base guests
= 41 - 20
= 21

The cost for each additional guest is $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional guests is:

Cost for additional guests = Number of additional guests * Cost per additional guest
= 21 * $6
= $126

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the base rental fee and the cost for the additional guests:

Total cost = Base rental fee + Cost for additional guests
= $125 + $126
= $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie and Riza each had an equal amount of money, and they spent a portion of it. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3.

To find the initial amount of money they had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the initial amount of money they had is x. Since they each had $60, we can write the equation:

x + x = 60 + 60
2x = 120

Now, we can solve for x:

2x = 120
x = 120/2
x = 60

So, the initial amount of money they had is $60 each.

Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is 1/4 * 60 = 15. Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 1/3 * 60 = 20.

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

$60 - $35 = $25

The two of them have $25 left.

The final answer is $25."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total number of bananas by 7 to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

315 ÷ 7 = 45 bananas per week

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the number of bananas each monkey eats in a week by 7 to find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day.

45 ÷ 7 = 6.43 bananas per day

However, we are told that the first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey. So, the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats per day, we need to subtract the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas.

The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

The third monkey eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to consider the number of pieces he completed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he completed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, the correct answer is 750."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny wants to buy 15 roses. Roses cost $2 each, and a dozen (12) roses cost $15. We can calculate the cost of 15 roses in two ways:

1. 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30
2. 1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since we know that 1.25 dozen is equivalent to 15 roses, we can use either method to calculate the cost. Let's use the second method for consistency.

Now, let's calculate the change Jenny will receive:

Jenny pays with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of $25. The cost of the roses is $18.75. To find the change, we subtract the cost from the amount she paid:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can divide the change by 4:

$6.25 ÷ 4 = 1.5625

Since we can't give a fraction of a quarter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can give 1 quarter (0.25) and 1 dollar in change.

Jenny will receive 1 quarter and 1 dollar in change.

Final Answer: The number of quarters Jenny will leave with is 1."

- Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
- Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
- Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

To find the total revenue, we add these amounts together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162

The final answer is: $162"
"As a train scheduling expert, I can break down the waiting time for Paul into manageable segments. Let's analyze the train schedule:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. This means the time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

To find the total waiting time for Paul, we need to sum up the waiting times for each train:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 0 + 20
= 70 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we need to calculate the number of toothpicks she still needs to save.

Melanie has saved 120 toothpicks so far, and she needs a total of 200 toothpicks. To find the number of toothpicks she still needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

Final Answer: The final answer is 8."
"To calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The original price of the watch is unknown, but we know that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. Let's call the original price 'x'. Then, the sale price is 0.75x.

2. We know that Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 0.75x = 0.9x.

3. The sale price is 0.9x, and the original price is x. The discount is x - 0.9x = 0.1x.

4. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (0.1x / x) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10\%}$"
"As a marine biologist specializing in the study of jellyfish, I can provide a precise calculation for the number of jellyfish created by multiple springs.

To determine the total number of jellyfish created, we need to calculate the rate of jellyfish creation per hour by one spring and then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can assume that the rate of jellyfish creation is 1 jellyfish per second. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

The number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

If 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

In 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created is 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72,000}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. We can represent this mathematically as:

F = 2B + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. We can substitute this value into the equation:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is: $\boxed{195}$"
"To calculate the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

The total distance James walked is 4 miles (2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each or $3.00 for a bunch, and Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch. To find out how much money she saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually and compare it to the cost of buying 10 bunches.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches individually:
10 bunches * $0.80 per bunch = $8.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches:
10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
$8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

Since the result is negative, it means Jenny actually spent more money by buying in bunches instead of individually. However, if we want to find out how much she saved, we can take the absolute value of the result:
$22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To determine how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets. Since they are splitting the 100 feet of fence, we can set up an equation.

Let's say Sam gets x feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets x + 60 feet.

We know that the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount he gets from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

The amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet."
"To calculate the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can use the formula for linear growth:

Total growth = growth rate * number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, the growth rate is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"As a bicycle enthusiast and owner of a bicycle store, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the price of a BMX bike, which is half the price of an MTB. Since the price of an MTB is $500, the price of a BMX bike is:

Price of BMX bike = Price of MTB / 2
= $500 / 2
= $250

Now, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold:

Number of Trekking bikes = Total bikes * 0.5
= 300 * 0.5
= 150

Number of BMX bikes = Total bikes * 0.15
= 300 * 0.15
= 45

Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - (Number of Trekking bikes + Number of BMX bikes)
= 300 - (150 + 45)
= 300 - 195
= 105

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = Number of Trekking bikes * Price of Trekking bike
= 150 * $450
= $67,500

Earnings from BMX bikes = Number of BMX bikes * Price of BMX bike
= 45 * $250
= $11,250

Earnings from MTB bikes = Number of MTB bikes * Price of MTB bike
= 105 * $500
= $52,500

Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
= $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500
= $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"As a farm management expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a detailed breakdown of the hay production and harvesting process.

In this scenario, the farmer and the truck driver work simultaneously, which means their combined rate of hay production and harvesting is the sum of their individual rates. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Therefore, the combined rate of hay production and harvesting is 5 + 3 = 8 bales per hour.

Since they work for 6 hours, the total number of bales produced and harvested is 8 * 6 = 48.

However, the question asks for the number of bales left in the field. To find this, we need to subtract the number of bales picked up from the total number of bales produced and harvested. The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, it picks up 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

The number of bales left in the field is 48 - 18 = 30.

Therefore, 30 bales of hay are left in the field.

"To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to consider his class schedule and additional learning time.

John attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. This translates to a daily class time of 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Additionally, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, which is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

The total minutes spent on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"As a physics enthusiast, I'd be delighted to help you with this problem. When a bouncy ball bounces, its height is determined by the equation:

h = h0 * (2/3)^(n)

where h is the height after the nth bounce, h0 is the initial height, and n is the number of bounces.

In this case, the initial height (h0) is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

To find the height after the second bounce, we can plug in n = 2 into the equation:

h = 72 * (2/3)^(2)
h = 72 * (4/9)
h = 32 feet

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know the height of the first child is 6 feet, which is equivalent to 72 inches. 

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings from selling apples, we need to divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10) to find the number of bags sold.

2000 ÷ 10 = 200 bags

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000."
"As a paleontologist specializing in Mesozoic-era carnivores, I can provide a detailed analysis of the scenario.

To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. Let's denote the initial amount of meat as 'x'. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, the velociraptors ate x/2 kilograms.

The Allosaurus then consumed the remaining half of what the velociraptors had, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms. We are given that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270.

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080.

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 1080"
"To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans available.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 11 sodas left. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas.

The friend can choose from the remaining 7 cans (2 shaken + 5 unshaken). The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/7) * 100 = 28.57%

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57\%}$"
"When two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, their relative motion can be calculated using the concept of relative velocity. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their velocities to find the relative velocity.

Let's denote the velocity of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the velocity of the second train as v2 = 30 miles per hour. The relative velocity (v_rel) is the sum of their velocities:
v_rel = v1 + v2 = 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we multiply the relative velocity by the time:
Distance = v_rel * time = 90 miles/hour * 3 hours = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

"To calculate the total number of people Billy can help, we need to determine the number of days he is available to volunteer and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

Final answer: 150"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

Let's break it down step by step:

Number of people in buses = Number of buses * Number of people per bus
= 12 * 35
= 420

Number of people in cars = Number of cars * Number of people per car
= 20 * 3
= 60

Total number of people = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
= 420 + 60
= 480

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480."
"To determine Jeff's age, we can use the information provided about the age difference between Martha and Mike. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"As a waterpark enthusiast and a fan of the vibrant color yellow, I'm excited to dive into this problem. Given the information, we can calculate the time it takes to ride each slide.

The time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes. 

The time it takes to ride the second biggest slide is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down Bobby's daily routine to calculate the total time spent on his lunch and breaks.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks per day. To find the total time spent on these activities, we can add the time for lunch and the time for breaks.

Time for lunch: 30 minutes
Time for breaks: 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time per day: 30 + 30 = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time per day to hours:
60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5:
1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find Micah's distance, we multiply Amber's distance by 3.5.

Micah's distance = 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three.

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
= 52 - (8 + 28)
= 52 - 36
= 16 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item.

The frying pan was originally priced at $20.00 and had a 20% discount. The discount amount is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was originally priced at $30.00 and had a 10% discount. The discount amount is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items purchased is $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be $85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00, then $70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. This allows us to set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic relationship between the ages of Caroline, Ben, and Chris.

We know that Chris is 4 years old. Let's denote Caroline's age as C and Ben's age as B. According to the problem, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we can write the equation:

C = 3B

We also know that Ben is two times older than Chris, so we can write another equation:

B = 2C

Now, we can substitute the expression for B from the second equation into the first equation:

C = 3(2C)
C = 6C

To solve for C, we can subtract C from both sides of the equation:

C - C = 6C - C
0 = 5C

Now, we can divide both sides by 5:

C = 0 / 5
C = 0

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as Caroline's age cannot be 0. Let's re-examine the equations.

We can rewrite the second equation as:

B = 2C
B = 2(4)
B = 8

Now that we have the value of B, we can substitute it into the first equation:

C = 3B
C = 3(8)
C = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. As a financial expert, I'll provide a clear and concise solution.

To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year. 

Let's assume she saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is still a negative number. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

To calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement period, we can use the formula:

Total Amount Needed = (Annual Savings / Annual Savings Rate) * Number of Years

Since we don't know the exact amount she needs to save, let's assume she needs to save x dollars. We know she saves $20,000 per year and plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year.

We can set up an equation:

x = (20,000 / 0.20) * 20

x = 200,000

This means she needs to save $200,000 for her retirement period.

Since she saves $20,000 per year, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work:

Number of Years = Total Amount Needed / Annual Savings
= $200,000 / $20,000
= 10 years

However, this is the number of years she needs to save, not work. Since she needs to save $200,000 and saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

Number of Years = Total Amount Needed / Annual Savings
= $200,000 / $20,000
= 10 years

Since she needs to save $200,000 and saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for 10 years.

However, the question asks how many more years she needs to work. Since she needs to work for 10 years to save $200,000, she doesn't need to work any more years."
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of division. We start by dividing the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This can be represented as:

100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm per part

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be divided into (5). This can be represented as:

25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the total number of girls in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as x. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"
"As a gardening expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount spent by my mom at the gardening shop.

To find the total amount spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil, then subtract the coupon value.

Cost of pots: $19

"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we need to find the total height of all the heels and divide by the total number of heels.

The total height of the 4-inch heels is 3 x 4 = 12 inches.
The total height of the 2-inch heels is 3 x 2 = 6 inches.
The total height of all heels is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

Since there are a total of 6 heels (3 of 4 inches and 3 of 2 inches), we can calculate the average height by dividing the total height by the total number of heels:

Average height = Total height / Total number of heels
= 18 / 6
= 3 inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we need to calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.

The total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 + 4 = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially was 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques is 12 - 7 = 5 kg.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we need to consider the changes in temperature over the specified period.

The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight, which means the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. Then, it increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. 

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Drop in temperature + Increase in temperature
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down Raymond's financial situation step by step.

Initially, Raymond had $21. He then added $11 from his allowance, making his total $21 + $11 = $32. After spending $5 on a comic book, he had $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, leaving him with $27 - $19 = $8.

Raymond has $8 left.

"To determine the cost of each book, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each book as 'x'. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x. We know that the total amount she had initially was $16, and she spent $4 initially, leaving her with $12. After buying the books, she had $2 left. This means the total cost of the books is $12. 

We can set up the equation: 2x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

So, each book cost $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New value = Old value + (Old value * Percentage increase)

In this case, the old value is 50 students, and the percentage increase is 20%. We can plug these values into the formula:

New value = 50 + (50 * 0.20)
New value = 50 + 10
New value = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the concept of rate and proportion. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Let's denote the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times as x minutes. We can set up the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

255x = 459 * 5

255x = 2295

Now, we can divide both sides by 255:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9.00 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.00 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Let's dive into the world of aquatic life and calculate the difference between the number of female and male fish in Tate's garden pond.

To find the total number of male and female fish, we need to add the initial number of fish and the number of fish Tate bought.

Initial male guppies: 4
Initial female guppies: 7
Initial male goldfishes: 3
Initial female goldfishes: 5

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish:
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: 5"
"To calculate the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we need to analyze the given information.

Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Since Megan had to walk the dog and this task took her 2 hours longer than Amalia, we can calculate Megan's time as 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior's work was to do laundry, and she took over 4 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Therefore, Dior's time can be calculated as 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours."
"To calculate the total distance driven in a month, we need to consider the round trip distance. The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since John visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days. If Sofie walks 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she covers in 7 days.

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/day * 7 days
Distance = 70 miles

Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can divide the total distance by 2 to find out how far Brian walks in 7 days.

Brian's Distance = Sofie's Distance / 2
Brian's Distance = 70 miles / 2
Brian's Distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to analyze the production capacity of the first four workers and the total number of toys required to fulfill the order.

Let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, and two workers produce 4 toys per hour. They work for 10 hours.

The production of the first two workers is 2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys.
The production of the last two workers is 2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys.

The total production of the first four workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to ship the order, the total number of toys required is 200 + 20 = 220 toys.

The fifth worker must produce 220 - 200 = 20 toys in 10 hours.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: 20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris, and Kris had 16 stickers, Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers initially.

Now, we need to find out how many stickers Seth had initially. We know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis had 23 stickers. This means Seth had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers initially.

Therefore, Seth had 46 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is: 46"
"Let's dive into the world of M&M's and calculate the number of small bags John can make.

To find the total number of M&M's, we need to multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag and then multiply by the number of M&M's per ounce.

Total M&M's = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce
Total M&M's = 3 * 10 * 30
Total M&M's = 900

Now, we need to divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag to find the number of small bags.

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
Number of small bags = 900 / 10
Number of small bags = 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's."
"As an ornithologist specializing in seabirds, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the number of days it would take Alfie, the albatross, to fly half the circumference of the earth.

To calculate the number of days, we need to divide the distance Alfie needs to fly (half the earth's circumference) by his daily distance.

Half of the earth's circumference = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Alfie's daily distance = 400 km

Number of days = Distance to fly / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"As a speed enthusiast, I'm excited to dive into the world of high-performance vehicles. When it comes to determining the speed of the fastest car, we need to break down the information provided.

Let's start by finding the speed of the 2nd fastest car. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which can go 120 mph. To find the speed of the 2nd fastest car, we multiply the average car's speed by 5.

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 120 mph * 5
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 600 mph

Now that we have the speed of the 2nd fastest car, we can find the speed of the faster car. Since the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

Speed of faster car = 600 mph * 1.25
Speed of faster car = 750 mph

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'V'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'V - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We can set up the equation:

14 = 2 * (V - 2)

To solve for V, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:

7 = V - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate V:

V = 7 + 2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. We can express this as A = M.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. We can express this as C = S + 12 and C + S = 30.

Substituting C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's dive into the world of crayon organization and weight calculations.

To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to consider the number of crayons, the weight of each crayon, and the weight of each box.

Since Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons, we can calculate the total number of boxes needed:

Number of boxes = Total number of crayons / Number of crayons per box
= 200 / 8
= 25 boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

Total weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Total weight of crayons (in pounds) = Total weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the boxes is the same as the weight of the crayons, since each box weighs 8 ounces. So, the total weight of the boxes is also 12.5 pounds.

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Total weight of crayons + Total weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To calculate the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to consider the percentage of the tree that can be converted into logs and then into planks.

First, we find the total length of logs John can make: 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length by the log length to get the number of logs: 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Next, we calculate the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5: 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes: 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. To find her brother's salary, we can multiply Valerie's salary by 2.

Brother's salary = 2 * Valerie's salary
= 2 * $5000
= $10,000

Now, we know the salaries of both Valerie and her brother. Their combined salary is the sum of their individual salaries.

Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary
= $5000 + $10,000
= $15,000

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so we can multiply their combined salary by 2.

Mother's salary = 2 * Combined salary
= 2 * $15,000
= $30,000

Now, let's add up their salaries to find the total amount of money they all have together.

Total amount = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary
= $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000
= $40,000

Grandma's walking trail consists of 2 miles of beach walking and 1 mile of sidewalk walking. We know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Let's denote the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the beach as x minutes. Then, the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 2x minutes.

We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

x = 40 minutes / 2 miles

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

2x = 2(20 minutes) = 40 minutes

Since the total walk is 3 miles, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = 40 minutes + 40 minutes = 80 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 80 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of simple interest. Since she saves $4 per week, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save $60.

The total amount saved is the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
4x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 60 ÷ 4
x = 15

Therefore, it will take Jane 15 weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 15"
"To calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can use the following formula:

Total blue birds = (Number of trees with 7 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree) + (Number of trees with 4 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree) + (Number of trees with 3 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree)

Total blue birds = (3 * 7) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 3)
Total blue birds = 21 + 8 + 3
Total blue birds = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

We can set up the equation: x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"Let's analyze the situation. Donny can drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature, x degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, he can drink the water. This means the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces.

The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. Since the total amount of water is 5 ounces, the temperature of the other mug can be calculated as:

x = (Total amount of water) / (Amount of water from the other mug)
x = 5 / 1
x = 5 degrees

However, we know that the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. Since 5 degrees is less than 40 degrees, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-examine the problem. If Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, it means the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees. We can set up an inequality to represent this:

33 + (4/5)x ≥ 40

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

33 + (4/5)x ≥ 40
(4/5)x ≥ 7
x ≥ 7.5

Since the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees, the minimum value of x is 40.

Final answer: 40"
"As an animal husbandry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the farm's growth.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. To calculate the total number of animals after three weeks, we need to consider the daily and weekly growth.

Daily growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day

Weekly growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week

Total growth in 3 weeks:
- Cows: 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows
- Chickens: 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (growth) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (growth) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"As a bagel connoisseur, I can confidently calculate the cost of each bagel after a 10% discount on a 4-pack purchase.

To find the total cost of 4 packs of bagels, we can multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 packs * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell receives a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. The discount is 10% of $40.00, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we can find the cost of each bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels in each pack: $36.00 ÷ 9 bagels = $4.00 per bagel.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes he ate, we need to first determine the number of potatoes required for 5 scoops.

It's given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's first find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 5 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 5 scoops.

1.5 potatoes/scoop * 5 scoops = 7.5 potatoes

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate.

7.5 potatoes - 5 scoops = 2.5 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break it down into two parts: the number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

Eggs eaten in the first 30 days = 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs
Eggs eaten in the next 30 days = 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Total eggs eaten in 60 days = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens:

Total dozens of eggs = 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the total number of jellybeans is 60, and we need to find the number of blue jellybeans. We also know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans.

First, we can calculate the number of red jellybeans by multiplying the number of green jellybeans by 2:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 * Number of green jellybeans
= 2 * 17
= 34

Now, we can find the total number of non-blue jellybeans by adding the number of green and red jellybeans:

Total number of non-blue jellybeans = Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans
= 17 + 34
= 51

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - Total number of non-blue jellybeans
= 60 - 51
= 9

The number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"As a botanist specializing in citrus cultivation, I can provide a precise calculation for the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade.

Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, we can calculate the total lemons per year as follows:

5 trees/year × 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons/year

To find the total lemons in a decade, we multiply the lemons per year by the number of years in a decade (10 years):

30 lemons/year × 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: 300"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We are told that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the value of one part: 5/14 = x/84, where x is the value of one part. Solving for x, we get x = 84/14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54. This represents the initial number of women on the bus.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"As a floristry expert, I can break down the problem into two parts: the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number of bouquets sold.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold individually. Faraday earns $2 per sunflower, and he earned $26 from sunflowers in total. To find the number of sunflowers sold, we can divide the total earnings by the price per sunflower: 26 ÷ 2 = 13.

Next, we need to find the number of bouquets sold. Faraday earns $8 per bouquet, and he earned $56 from bouquets in total. To find the number of bouquets sold, we can divide the total earnings by the price per bouquet: 56 ÷ 8 = 7.

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is the number of bouquets sold multiplied by the number of sunflowers per bouquet: 7 * 12 = 84.

Therefore, Faraday sold 84 sunflowers in total.

Final answer: 84"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, we need to find out how much money he loses.

First, let's calculate the total number of rocks Adam can buy with $100. Since each rock costs $5, the total number of rocks is:

100 / 5 = 20 rocks

Since Adam sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is:

0.6 * 20 = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:

12 * 7 = $84

The cost of the rocks is $5 * 20 = $100

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost. However, the revenue is $84, which is less than the cost of $100. This means Adam loses $100 - $84 = $16.

To find the percentage loss, we can divide the loss by the total cost and multiply by 100:

($16 / $100) * 100 = 16%

So, Adam loses 16% of his investment.

The correct answer is:

$16"
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

Since there are 4 children, we can divide the total number of eggs by 4 to find the number of eggs each child receives.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Therefore, each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to multiply the number of days in May (31) by the daily cost of food per fish ($1).

Total cost = Number of days in May * Daily cost per fish

Total cost = $31

Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses. This will give us the remaining roses after the gift. Then, we add the number of roses she bought to find the final total.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the total distance and time as follows:

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"When calculating the probability of both tickets winning, we need to consider the joint probability of independent events. Since the outcome of one ticket does not affect the other, we can multiply their individual probabilities.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's represent the number of seashells Carlos collected as x. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

x = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected 22 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can set up another equation:

x = 2y

Substituting x = 22, we get:

22 = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 11

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person:

Total = x + y + 27
= 22 + 11 + 27
= 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got:

60 / 3
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"As a nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Mason's carrot consumption.

To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider his daily intake on weekdays and the weekend. 

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is: 30"
"To calculate the total time of the cassette, we need to determine the length of the second song. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The length of the second song is then x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

We know the length of the first song is 5 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:
1.6x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.6:
x = 5 / 1.6
x = 3.125 minutes

Now that we know the length of the first song, we can find the length of the second song:
Length of the second song = 1.6x
= 1.6 * 3.125
= 5 minutes

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of both songs:
Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 + 5
= 10 minutes

The total time of the cassette is 10 minutes.

"As a financial analyst specializing in profit calculations, I'd be happy to help you determine the total profit earned by Linus.

To calculate the total profit, we need to find the total cost and the total selling price of the mobile devices.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * (2 * $20) = $80.
The selling price of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * (2 * $20) = $160.
The total selling price is $80 + $160 = $240.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Given that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height is 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

As Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people is:

Total bottles needed = 2300 * 100% / 20%
Total bottles needed = 2300 * 5
Total bottles needed = 11500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles.

Number of days = Total bottles needed / Bottles produced per day
Number of days = 11500 / 4200
Number of days = 2.74

"To calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the number of babies wearing purple and the number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= (number of purple wearers) / (number of purple wearers + number of blue wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%.

The final answer is 75%."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of tax reports received is 5168. On Monday and Tuesday, the IRS received 1907 reports, and on Thursday and Friday, they received 2136 reports. To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total number of reports received on all days.

Let's denote the number of reports received on Wednesday as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 1907 + 2136 = 5168

Combine the constants on the left side of the equation:

x + 4043 = 5168

Subtract 4043 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5168 - 4043

x = 1125

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Let's break down Abraham's land sales step by step.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = $25 per square meter. Since he sold 40 square meters, his total earnings from this sale are 40 * $25 = $1000.

He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. This is equivalent to selling 20 square meters at $30 per square meter, resulting in 20 * $30 = $600.

Abraham has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so his earnings from this sale are 20 * $3 = $60.

To find the total amount Abraham earned, we add the earnings from each sale: $1000 + $600 + $60 = $1660.

The final answer is: $1660"
"To determine Geb's age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Haley's age as 'H' and Geb's age as 'G'. According to the problem, Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. This can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is 12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs, Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs. 

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found by each person from the total number of eggs: 36 - (5 + 10 + 8 + 4) = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the total number of apartments, we need to first find the total number of apartments in the last complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"Avocado Tree Fruit Production Calculation

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern of the tree. The problem states that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.

Let's break down the production pattern:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know Jack initially had $100. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we can multiply $100 by 1/5.

Now, we add the $20 to Jack's initial amount:

$100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"The yellow rope, my personal favorite, plays a crucial role in this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We're given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. If we denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R, we can express the relationships between the ropes as follows:

B = Y - 7
R = 4B

We also know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"When analyzing a wall mural with four colors - red, white, purple, and yellow - it's essential to consider the given conditions. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. Given that half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12. This simplifies to 4x = 12.

To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides of the equation by 4, resulting in x = 3.

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total area of Tom's house, we need to find the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"Cloud counting is a fascinating topic, and I'm delighted to dive into it. As someone who appreciates the beauty of yellow sunsets, I find the patterns in cloud formations quite intriguing.

To calculate the total number of clouds Alice counted, we can use a simple formula. Let's break it down day by day:

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. To find the cost per pod, we divide the cost by the number of pods: 
$12 ÷ 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 1 ÷ 0.10 = 10 cycles for $1.

The correct answer is: 10"

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to analyze the scoring patterns of both teams.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can set up an equation based on the rate at which he uses the chalk.

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as x. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can express the amount of chalk used as 0.20L. We know that the teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, so L = 5.

The teacher recycled the chalk when it was smaller than 2 inches, which means he used up 2.25 inches of chalk. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

0.20L = 2.25

Since L = 5, we can substitute this value into the equation:

0.20(5) = 2.25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1 = 2.25

This equation doesn't make sense, as the teacher can't use 1 inch of chalk to write. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 2.25 inches. This means he has 2.25 inches of chalk left. We can set up an equation to represent the remaining chalk:

L - 2.25 = 0.20L

Substituting L = 5, we get:

5 - 2.25 = 0.20(5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2.75 = 1

This equation also doesn't make sense. Let's re-evaluate the situation again.

The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 2.25 inches. This means he has 2.25 inches of chalk left. We can set up an equation to represent the remaining chalk:

0.20L = 2.25

Solving for L, we get:

L = 2.25 / 0.20
L = 11.25

This means the teacher started with 11.25 inches of chalk. We can now set up an equation to represent the remaining chalk:

11.25 - 2.25 = 0.20(11.25)x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

9 = 2.25x

Dividing both sides by 2.25, we get:

x = 9 / 2.25
x = 4

So, the teacher has 4 days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity can be found by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class: 24 - 7 = 17.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate the number of face masks Mike bought first. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Then, we need to find thrice the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 3 * 5 = 15.

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, the cost of the returned milk would be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's tackle this problem step by step.

We're dealing with a classic algebraic equation involving two variables, Wendy's age (W) and Colin's age (C). Our goal is to find Colin's current age.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

Now, let's consider the second statement: in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 3:

3C + 75 = W

Now, we can substitute W from the first equation into this new equation:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000.

We know that 100 books cost $500. To find the number of sets Bob can buy, we can divide the total amount he has ($27,000) by the cost of 100 books ($500).

$27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find the number of sets per school.

54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school

As each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school.

18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."

1. He picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
2. He puts all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
3. He throws 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brings home 12 apples.

Total Weight of Coal = 850 kg
Weight per Bag = 50 kg
Cost per Bag = $18

Total Cost = (850 kg / 50 kg) * $18
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by her friends and then divide that by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we can use the following formula:

Total miles = (Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + (Miles on Tuesday and Thursday)
Total miles = (3 miles * 3 days) + (5 miles * 2 days)
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles
Total miles = 19 miles

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to consider the net rate at which he builds snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour but loses 2 every 15 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the number of snowballs lost per hour. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs lost per hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we can find the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour by subtracting the number lost from the number built: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can use a simple division problem. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age

We are given that John's current age is 28. We can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's age

To solve for Jim's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. This can be represented as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Combine like terms:

3x + 3

We know that the total number of slices is 8. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 3 = 8

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

Since x represents the number of slices Doxa ate, we can calculate the number of slices each person ate:

Doxa: x = 5/3
Her sister: x + 1 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3
Her brother: x + 2 = 5/3 + 2 = 11/3

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person:
(5/3) + (8/3) + (11/3) = 24/3 = 8

The total number of slices eaten is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the nurses ordered bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack. This means they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had 12 bandages from the first day, so they had 12 + 28 = 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had 40 - 25 = 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they had 15 bandages left after the third day, they must have had 78 + 15 = 93 bandages at the beginning of the third day.

To find the initial number of bandages, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the initial number of bandages.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 28 bandages and still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used 25, so they had x - 16 + 100 - 25 = x + 59 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:

x + 59 = 78

Subtracting 59 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

The final answer is: 19"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the length of her hair and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

"As a financial analyst specializing in hourly wage calculations, I can confidently calculate Jen's total earnings for April.

To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate her total hours worked and her total earnings from hourly rate and attendance.

Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Total earnings = $270 + $10 = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"Let's break down Jason's earnings into individual components to calculate his total earnings.

Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

To find the total earnings, we can multiply the frequency of each task by its respective amount and add them together.

- Earning from emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
- Earning from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Earning from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
- Earning from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"Let's dive into the world of marine biology and calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks.

We know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. To find the amount of blood a single shark has, we can multiply the amount of blood a whale has by 3:

40 gallons (whale's blood) × 3 = 120 gallons (shark's blood)

Now, we need to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have. We can do this by multiplying the amount of blood a single shark has by 10:

120 gallons (shark's blood) × 10 = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks have a total of 1200 gallons of blood.

The final answer is: 1200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning. At 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. So, the total is now 90 + 80 = 170 people.

By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. So, the total is now 170 + 120 = 290 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The problem states that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. To find the number of black pens, we multiply the number of red pens by 2: 25 pens * 2 = 50 pens.

Now, we can find the total number of pens by adding the number of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first determine the cost of the scotch and cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 ÷ 10 = $60

Since the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, we can calculate the cost per bottle of cognac by multiplying the cost of the scotch by 1.5:

Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 × 1.5 = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:

Total cost = $600 + $1800 = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

"To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66. This is calculated as 66 / 3 = 22.

The remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.

Next, we find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which is 5/11 * 44 = 20.

Now, we add the number of fish with red stripes (22) and the number of fish with blue stripes (20) to get the total number of fish with both stripes.

The total number of fish with red and blue stripes is 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."

"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the roof. 

First, we find the height of the first floor: 
The height of the first floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall. 
So, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Then, we find the height of the second floor: 
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, 
so the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor: 
The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, 
which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

"Let's dive into the world of shell distribution. As a shell enthusiast, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We have 700 shells in total. Team Alphas, being the first to arrive, found 40% of the shells. To calculate this, we multiply 700 by 0.4.

700 * 0.4 = 280

Now, we need to find the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Next, team The finders took their turn, finding 60% of the remaining shells. We calculate this by multiplying 420 by 0.6.

420 * 0.6 = 252

To find the number of shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

"To determine the walking distance of the last dog, we can start by finding the total walking distance required for all four dogs. Since the average walking distance per dog is 3 miles, we can multiply this by the total number of dogs.

Total walking distance = Average walking distance per dog * Number of dogs
Total walking distance = 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs
Total walking distance = 12 miles

Now, we can subtract the known walking distances of the first three dogs from the total to find the walking distance of the last dog.

Walking distance of the last dog = Total walking distance - (Walking distance of the first dog + Walking distance of the second dog + Walking distance of the third dog)
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - (1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles)
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - 8 miles
Walking distance of the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can follow a straightforward approach.

First, we need to determine the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be calculated as:

Loan Amount = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan is used to pay off debts. Since 60% of the loan is used for debt repayment, we can calculate this as:

Amount Used for Debt Repayment = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

Finally, to find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used for debt repayment from the loan amount:

Amount Leftover = Loan Amount - Amount Used for Debt Repayment
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."

"To calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to consider the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day for 3 days, resulting in 2 * 3 = 6 liters. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day for 5 days, resulting in 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Total amount of water removed = 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

"As a dean of a private school, I can provide a detailed analysis of the capacity of both schools.

To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate the capacity of one of his classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30

"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial loan amount of $300. The interest rate is 2% of the initial amount.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, we can calculate the total amount paid in 11 months:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the twelfth month. To find this amount, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months:

"To calculate the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the packing efficiency of the jelly beans.

The volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches. Since the jelly beans have an average volume of 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans by dividing the volume by the volume of a single jelly bean: 360 / 0.15 = 2400.

However, we need to account for the packing efficiency, which is approximately 80%. To do this, we divide the total number of jelly beans by the packing efficiency: 2400 / 0.8 = 3000.

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3: 3000 * 0.3 = 900.

Now, let's compare this to the true number of red jelly beans, which is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 900 = 0.

The final answer is: 0"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. Initially, it had 20 people on board. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. The total number of people on the bus is now 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, so the total number of people on the bus is now 90 * 2 = 180.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to consider the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning Aiden needs, we can use a simple ratio. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds of meat by 2.

Let's calculate the total amount of seasoning needed:

Number of pounds of meat = 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds

Total amount of seasoning needed = 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for the cookout.

"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we can multiply the number of windows by the width of each window and then multiply the result by 2.

Number of windows = 5
Width of each window = 35 inches

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to consider the two pricing tiers: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Since it's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, we add 1 inch to the result, making the total inches of rain on Tuesday 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by letting the number of cupcakes Carly made be x. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. We can set up the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to consider the discounted price of the services and the additional cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"To calculate the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to consider the number of issues from each magazine.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic equation involving variables representing the number of paintings each person has.

We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. We can represent the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley's paintings can be represented as x + 8. Samantha's paintings, which are 12 fewer than Shelley's, can be represented as (x + 8) - 12.

We're given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

To solve for x, we'll simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"
"To calculate the price of the toy after the discounts, we need to apply the percentage changes sequentially.

First, we calculate the price increase in December: $40 + 80% of $40 = $40 + $32 = $72.

Then, we calculate the price decrease in January: $72 - 50% of $72 = $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"As a tennis pro, I can break down the calculation into two parts: the standard rate lessons and the veteran rate lessons.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. This is a basic concept in statistics, and I'm happy to help.

First, let's add up the scores:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

There are 9 scores in total. Now, let's divide the sum by 9:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

The mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Since Eve had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can represent the number of pomelos she had left as (1/4) × 20. 

Let's calculate the number of pomelos Eve had left: (1/4) × 20 = 5.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she had left from the original amount: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"To calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we need to first find the number of apples he sold. 

Walter initially bought 60 apples and ate 24, leaving him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples. He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is 0.25 * 36 = 9 apples. The number of apples left for sale is 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

Since Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each, the total amount of money he received is 27 * 3 = $81.

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 3 quarters of the novels she wrote last year (9) is equal to the number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of novels.

Let x be the total number of novels written this year. The proportion can be set up as follows:

3/4 = 9/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3x = 9 * 4
3x = 36

Now, divide both sides by 3:

x = 36/3
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"As a transportation expert, I can analyze Michael's travel scenario to determine the percentage of the distance covered.

To calculate the total distance covered, we need to multiply Michael's average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, Michael traveled for 3 days, so the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"As a macaroni and cheese aficionado, I can confidently calculate the total cost of making this beloved dish. To do so, we need to consider the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00, while the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00. 

The total cost per week is the sum of these three components: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

To find the total cost per year, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 weeks: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we need to divide the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) by the total number of minutes in 40 hours (40 * 60 = 2400 minutes). 

(1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100 = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their 8-hour workday cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we can calculate the total capacity of the shelves and then divide the total number of books by the total capacity.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 ÷ 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

Final answer: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, 5 dozens will have 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we find the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"As a seasoned expert in snack economics, I can confidently calculate the cost per stick of beef jerky. 

To find the cost per stick, we need to first determine the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:
$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:
$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate the required percentage of correct answers as follows:

Total questions = 110
Required percentage = 70%

Let's calculate the required number of correct answers:

Required correct answers = Total questions * Required percentage
= 110 * 0.7
= 77

Since Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions, we can find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test by subtracting the number of correct answers from the first test from the total required correct answers:

Questions needed on the second test = Required correct answers - Correct answers on the first test
= 77 - 42
= 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"To calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the process into steps.

First, we need to determine the number of customers Jason needs to get to sell 15 cars. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we can set up a proportion:

Number of customers / 2 = 15
Number of customers = 15 * 2
Number of customers = 30

Next, we need to calculate the number of potential customers Jason needs to get 30 customers. Since for every 2 customers, 1 car is sold, we can set up another proportion:

Number of potential customers / 1 = 30
Number of potential customers = 30 * 1
Number of potential customers = 30

Finally, we need to calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 potential customers. Since for every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated, we can set up a proportion:

Number of telephone calls / 25 = 30
Number of telephone calls = 30 * 25
Number of telephone calls = 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

Let's calculate the number of candles in each half of the house:
Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms.
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that there are 20 helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. To find the number of footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40

"As an artist and varnish expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

When applying a coat of varnish to paintings, it's essential to consider the drying time to ensure the artwork is protected and preserved. The original varnish took 7 minutes to dry on one painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.

To determine the difference in drying time for 6 paintings, we can calculate the time it would take for each varnish to dry on 6 paintings.

For the old varnish, the drying time is 7 minutes per painting. Therefore, for 6 paintings, the total drying time is 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

For the new varnish, the drying time is 12 minutes per painting. Therefore, for 6 paintings, the total drying time is 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

"As a wildlife expert specializing in amphibian behavior, I can provide a detailed analysis of Phineas Frog's return journey.

To calculate the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to consider the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

Therefore, Phineas Frog will take 15 minutes to return home.

"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

John's original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 
4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

"The art of popcorn popping! As a popcorn connoisseur, I can assure you that the key to understanding the popping process lies in the rate of kernel activation. Let's break it down step by step:

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop at a rate of 20/30 = 2/3 of the total kernels. This initial burst of energy sets the stage for the subsequent popping rates.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, resulting in 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popping at a rate of 60/30 = 2 kernels per second.

The popping rate then increases to 4 times the initial rate, which is 4 * 2 = 8 kernels per second, for the next 30 seconds. This yields 8 * 30 = 240 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves to 4 kernels per second, resulting in 4 * 30 = 120 kernels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 340 kernels.

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat, which is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.

The total number of kernels that popped is 340 + 30 = 370 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice required. Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of cups of lemon juice needed:

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed:

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons to make the required amount of lemonade.

Final Answer: The final answer is 30."
"As a canine nutrition expert, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the total amount of dog food needed in a week.

To determine the total weekly consumption, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of German Shepherds is 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day.
The daily consumption of Bulldogs is 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day.
The total daily consumption is 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg/day.

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg.

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"In the context of animal husbandry and zoology, when calculating the total number of pairs of animal legs, we must consider the number of legs for each species. 

Given that there are 10 two-legged animals and 15 four-legged animals, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

2-legged animals: 10 * 2 = 20 legs
4-legged animals: 15 * 4 = 60 legs

Total legs: 20 + 60 = 80 legs

To find the total number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

80 legs / 2 = 40 pairs

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. This means the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can set up an equation to find the number of red blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) + x (red) = 32.

Solving for x, we get: x = 32 - 4 - 8
x = 20

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down Elvis's journey step by step.

To find the total distance Elvis traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and add them together.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first part of the journey (west), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

For the second part of the journey (east), the distance is:
Distance = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to find the net distance from his house. To do this, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to apply the depreciation rates for each year.

The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year, which can be expressed as 0.3 in decimal form. 

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year, which can be expressed as 0.3 in decimal form.

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to first find the number of orange and yellow candies.

The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

Since the total number of candies in the bag is 232, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."
"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to determine the cost of the bus trips and add it to the cost of the hotel.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.

Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

Total cost = Cost of hotel + Cost of bus trips
Total cost = $80 + $56
Total cost = $136

The final answer is: $136"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mazie has 52 marbles and gives them to twins, Dallas and Darla. We also know that Dallas drops 4 marbles in the playground. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first find out how many marbles Dallas had initially.

Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial marbles = Marbles after dropping + Marbles dropped
Initial marbles = 21 + 4
Initial marbles = 25

Now, we know that the total number of marbles is 52, and Dallas initially had 25 marbles. To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can subtract 25 from 52.

Marbles given to Darla = Total marbles - Initial marbles
Marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25
Marbles given to Darla = 27

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there are 3 family members (2 adults and 1 child), the total cost of the tickets is:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the force required to move the car, we need to consider the total weight of the car and its contents. The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, and the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds. Additionally, there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, so their combined weight is 150 pounds.

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the total length of crepe paper needed, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

P = 2(20 + 15)
P = 2(35)
P = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence.

The final answer is: 70"
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can use the formula for calculating the average of two numbers: (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2.

Given that Mia is 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by plugging in the values into the formula.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"Let's dive into the world of swine nutrition and feed management. As a swine nutrition expert, I'll provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Dexter has five pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. To calculate the total daily feed consumption, we multiply the number of pigs by the amount of feed each pig eats per day.

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7.

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered.

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

Therefore, after a week, Dexter will have 20 pounds of feed left.

"To calculate the total number of hot dogs needed, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of hot dogs each guest will eat.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
Number of packs needed: 36 / 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

The final answer is: $12"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Frances sells cupcakes and cookies, and she buys trays of cupcakes. To find out how much money she has left, we need to calculate her total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate her total income from cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40
Next, let's calculate her total income from cookies: 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40
Now, we add her total income from cupcakes and cookies: $40 + $40 = $80

Frances buys 5 trays of cupcakes at $4 per tray. To find the total cost of the trays, we multiply the number of trays by the cost per tray: 5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jake is shopping at a clothing store with a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we need to calculate the total cost of the T-shirts.

The first T-shirt is full price, so its cost is $8. The second T-shirt has a 50% discount, which means Jake pays 50% of the original price. To find 50% of $8, we multiply $8 by 0.5.

Cost of the second T-shirt = $8 x 0.5 = $4

Total cost of T-shirts = Cost of the first T-shirt + Cost of the second T-shirt
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.4.

Discount on the shoes = $40 x 0.4
= $16

Cost of the shoes = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
The total number of items Igor had is T + B + P, and we know this equals 29. So, we can set up the equation: 8 + B + 16 = 29.

Solving for B, we get: B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5.

However, we are asked to find the number of beakers Igor lost. Since Igor had 7 beakers requested, the number of beakers he lost is 7 - 5 = 2.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 x 4 x 2
Total screws needed = 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"Let's calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets. Since there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, we can represent this as 2 times the number of eggs in the first basket. 

The number of eggs in the first basket is 10. To find the number of eggs in the second basket, we multiply 10 by 2.

10 * 2 = 20

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total.

10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to find the individual amounts raised by each person and add them together.

Let's start by finding the amount raised by Kim. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, and Alexandra raises $430, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:

Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
Kim's amount = $430 + $320
Kim's amount = $750

Next, we find Maryam's amount. Since Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raises $300, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:

Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
Maryam's amount = $300 + $400
Maryam's amount = $700

Now, we have the amounts raised by each person: Alexandra ($430), Kim ($750), Maryam ($700), and Sarah ($300). To find the total amount, we add these amounts together:

Total amount = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Maryam's amount + Sarah's amount
Total amount = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300
Total amount = $2080

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, and we're given the following information:

- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, we can assume that Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron. Let's denote Aaron's speed as 'x' miles per minute. Then, Vanessa's speed would be '2x' miles per minute.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles, we can set up the equation: 2 miles / x miles per minute = 16 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 2 miles per minute.

Now that we know Aaron's speed, we can find Vanessa's speed by multiplying his speed by 2: 2x = 2 * 2 miles per minute = 4 miles per minute.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance by her speed: 4 miles / 4 miles per minute = 1 minute.

Therefore, Vanessa took 1 minute to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can use a simple calculation. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 x 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

Total line to buy = Total line required - 6 feet
Total line to buy = 600 - 6
Total line to buy = 594 feet

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"As a financial analyst specializing in restaurant operations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Tom's restaurant revenue.

To calculate the weekly revenue, we need to consider the number of reservations, meal prices, and the cost of the wine. Assuming the restaurant operates 2 days a week, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (Number of reservations * Number of meals per reservation * Meal price) + (Number of reservations * Wine price)
= (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
= $60 + $30
= $90 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $90 * 2
= $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To calculate the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the following formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)

Given:
Cost Price = $80
Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25

Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons, we can find the selling price per watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.
Jane will peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to consider the discount and labor costs.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark gets an 80% discount, which means he pays 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is 0.2 * $400 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

Final answer: $230"
"Let's tackle this problem using the principles of algebra. We're given that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, consisting of chickens and cows, with a combined total of 70 legs. We can represent the number of chickens as 'x' and the number of cows as '20 - x'.

Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up the equation:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

Now, let's verify our solution by plugging x = 5 into the original equation:

2(5) + 4(20 - 5) = 10 + 4(15) = 10 + 60 = 70

This confirms that our solution is correct.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. Since there are 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

Now, we divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4):

56 ÷ 4 = 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

Final Answer: The final answer is 14."
