"To determine Janet's daily earnings from selling eggs at the farmers' market, we must first calculate the total number of eggs she has available for sale. 

Janet lays 16 eggs per day and consumes 3 for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. She then bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her available supply to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, her daily earnings can be calculated as follows:

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding the amount of blue and white fiber:

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
= 2 bolts + 1 bolt
= 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit made by Josh after investing in the house, we need to determine the increase in value due to the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. This can be represented as a multiplier of 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

The new value of the house is calculated by multiplying the original price by this multiplier:

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

To find the profit, we subtract the original price from the new value:

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs per week, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Specifically, we can apply the multiplication operation to find the product of the number of sprints per week and the number of meters per sprint.

Let's denote the number of sprints per week as 's' and the number of meters per sprint as 'm'. We are given that s = 3 and m = 60. To find the total number of meters run per week, we can calculate the product of 's' and 'm':

Total meters per week = s × m
= 3 × 60
= 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs for the final meal, we must first calculate the total daily feed requirement for her flock. Given that each chicken receives three cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens in the flock, the total daily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens × 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, we can subtract this amount from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already provided
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the glasses, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining 15 glasses.

The cost of the first glass is a fixed amount of $5. 

For the remaining 15 glasses, we need to calculate the cost of each glass, which is 60% of the original price. This can be expressed as 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass.

The total cost of the remaining 15 glasses is then 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost of all 16 glasses is the sum of the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses: $5 + $45 = $50.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $50 for the glasses.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

Given that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can express this relationship as C = 4S. Additionally, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which can be represented as T = 2C.

We are also given that Seattle has 20 sheep, so S = 20.

Substituting S = 20 into the equation C = 4S, we find C = 4 * 20 = 80.

Now, substituting C = 80 into the equation T = 2C, we find T = 2 * 80 = 160.

To determine the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we can break down the process into two segments: the initial download and the subsequent restart and re-download.

The initial download consists of 80% of the 200 GB file, which is 0.8 * 200 = 160 GB. Given that Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, the time taken for the initial download is:

Time = Total size / Download speed
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

However, the download is interrupted at this point, and a 20-minute restart is required. After the restart, the download is re-initiated from the beginning. Since the total file size remains the same, the subsequent download also takes 80 minutes.

The total time taken for the entire process is the sum of the initial download time and the restart time, plus the time taken for the re-download:

Total time = Initial download time + Restart time + Re-download time
Total time = 80 minutes + 20 minutes + 80 minutes
Total time = 180 minutes

Therefore, the total time taken to download the file is 180 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down his journey into segments and apply the concept of relative motion.

Initially, John drives for 3 hours at a constant speed of 60 mph. The distance covered during this period can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 60 mph × 3 hours
= 180 miles

Since John then spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, his position does not change, and the distance from home remains 180 miles.

Next, John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph. The distance covered during this period can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 30 mph × 0.5 hours
= 15 miles

After this, John drives for 2 hours at a constant speed of 80 mph. The distance covered during this period can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 80 mph × 2 hours
= 160 miles

The total distance traveled by John is the sum of the distances covered in each segment:

Total Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 160 miles
= 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

Distance from home = Total Distance - Initial Distance
= 355 miles - 180 miles
= 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we can break down her compensation into two components: regular pay and overtime pay.

First, we calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours worked at a rate of $10 per hour:

Regular pay = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we calculate her overtime pay for the 5 hours worked beyond the regular 40 hours at a rate of $10/hour multiplied by 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier):

Overtime pay = 5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60

Total earnings for the week = Regular pay + Overtime pay
= $400 + $60
= $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

Final answer: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break down the process into individual steps.

First, we need to determine the number of downloads for each month. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, the number of downloads increased by a factor of three, resulting in 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. However, in the third month, the downloads decreased by 30% of the second month's total, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads.

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we can add the individual monthly totals together: 60 + 180 + 54 = 294 downloads.

The final answer is: $\boxed{294}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we can break down the costs as follows:

The cost of 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen is 3 * $68 = $204.
The cost of 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen is 2 * $80 = $160.
The cost of 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen is 6 * $55 = $330.

The total cost is the sum of these individual costs: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The final answer is: $694"
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we can use the concept of net present value (NPV) or simply calculate the number of years it takes to recover the initial investment. 

The annual net profit from the tree is $7.50. To find the number of years it takes to recover the initial cost of $90, we can divide the initial cost by the annual net profit.

Years to break even = Initial cost / Annual net profit
= $90 / $7.50
= 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Final answer: 12"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, resulting in a total of x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house.

The remaining vacuum cleaners after the green and red house sales are x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

Melanie then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house and those sold at the orange house: x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1.

Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5.

To simplify the equation, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 6. Multiply the entire equation by 6 to eliminate the fractions: 6x - (2x + 12 + x - 6) = 30.

Combine like terms: 6x - 3x - 6 = 30.
Simplify: 3x - 6 = 30.
Add 6 to both sides: 3x = 36.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students, which is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining students: 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

Finally, we find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students in jazz dance from the remaining students: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."
"To determine the best choice, we can apply the concept of expected value, which is a fundamental principle in decision-making under uncertainty. The expected value (EV) of each option can be calculated by multiplying the initial cost by the probability of the market increase and adding the result to the initial cost.

Let's calculate the expected value for each option:

For the jewelry:
EV = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
EV = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
EV = $5,000 * 1.025
EV = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
EV = Initial cost * (1 + Market increase)
EV = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
EV = $8,000 * 1.012
EV = $8,160

Since the expected value of the electronic gadgets ($8,160) is higher than the expected value of the jewelry ($5,250), the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

The merchant would make a profit of $8,160 - $8,000 = $160 by choosing the electronic gadgets.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total distance covered by each train, we can utilize the concept of vector addition. Since the trains traveled in two different directions (westward and northward), we need to consider the resultant displacement.

Let's denote the westward distance as 80 miles and the northward distance as 150 miles. We can represent these distances as vectors and add them using the Pythagorean theorem:

√(80² + 150²) = √(6400 + 22500) = √26900 ≈ 164.58 miles

This represents the resultant displacement of each train. However, the question asks for the total distance covered, which is the magnitude of the resultant displacement. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train is approximately 164.58 miles.

The final answer is: 164.58"
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we can utilize the concept of total weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her total weekly earnings:

Weekly earnings from teaching: 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
Weekly earnings from coaching: 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Total weekly earnings: $700/week + $450/week = $1,150/week

Since Jill works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary can be calculated as:

Annual salary = Total weekly earnings * Number of weeks worked in a year
Annual salary = $1,150/week * 50 weeks/year
Annual salary = $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks. Since she makes 3 eggs per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in 4 weeks (28 days). 

Total eggs = 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs

Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, we can then divide the total number of eggs by 12 to obtain the number of dozens.

Total dozens = 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for the remaining distance, we can utilize the concept of average speed and the formula for calculating it: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Given that Marissa wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can set up an equation to find the total time she needs to spend:

Total Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Total Time = 12 miles / 4 miles/hour
Total Time = 3 hours

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours, we can find the remaining time by subtracting the time spent from the total time:

Remaining Time = Total Time - Time Spent
Remaining Time = 3 hours - 2 hours
Remaining Time = 1 hour

Now, we can calculate the required speed for the remaining distance using the formula:

Required Speed = Distance / Time
Required Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Required Speed = 6 miles/hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain her desired average speed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

Let's start by finding the amount of water in each drink. The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:

(2/3) × 10 = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:

(3/5) × 15 = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:

(20/3) + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:

(20/3) - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

(17/3) + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

(44 ÷ 3) = 14.67

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 14.67 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we can calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son.

Let's denote Raymond's current age as R and his son's age as S. We know that R = 25 (since Raymond is 25 years old) and S = 23 (since Raymond had a son at the age of 23). 

The number of years ago Raymond's son was born can be calculated as: R - S = 25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers, who each purchased one DVD. This can be represented as 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

Next, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers, who each purchased 2 DVDs. This can be represented as 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Since the last 3 customers did not make any purchases, the total number of DVDs sold to them is 0.

Now, we can find the overall total by adding the number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total length reduction of the candle, we must first calculate the duration of the burning period. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a duration of 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can calculate the total length reduction as follows:

Length reduction = Rate of melting * Duration
= 2 cm/hour * 4 hours
= 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the original price of the book, we can use the concept of percentage decrease. The discounted price is $19.50, and it represents 75% of the original price (100% - 25% discount = 75%). 

Let's denote the original price as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

75% of x = $19.50
0.75x = $19.50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we can start by calculating the total cost of the items other than pizza. The cost of the chicken meal is $12, the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15, and the cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6. Therefore, the total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes can be found by subtracting the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid: $50 - $33 = $17.

Now, we can divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box to find the number of boxes ordered: $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of Mishka's clothing purchases, we can apply the principle of arithmetic addition. 

First, we calculate the total cost of each category of clothing: 
- The cost of 3 pairs of shorts is 3 × $16.50 = $49.50.
- The cost of 3 pairs of pants is 3 × $22.50 = $67.50.
- The cost of 3 pairs of shoes is 3 × $42 = $126.

Now, we add these costs together to find the total expenditure: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To determine the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia over 60 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each carton contains 15 servings and Cynthia consumes one serving per night, the total number of cartons required can be calculated as follows:

Number of cartons = Total number of servings / Servings per carton
= 60 servings / 15 servings per carton
= 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

Total cost = Number of cartons * Cost per carton
= 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton
= $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream over 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the total distance of the trip as D and the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip as D1. We are given that D = 60 miles and D1 = 40 miles (since Henry stopped after 20 miles).

The distance from the end of the trip to the second stop can be represented as D2. We are also given that D2 = 15 miles.

Using the fact that the total distance is the sum of the distances from the first stop to the end of the trip and from the end of the trip to the second stop, we can set up the equation:

D = D1 + D2
60 = 40 + D2

Solving for D2, we get:

D2 = 60 - 40
D2 = 20

Now, we can find the distance between the first and second stops by subtracting D2 from D1:

Distance between the first and second stops = D1 - D2
= 40 - 20
= 20

Therefore, the distance between Henry's first and second stops is 20 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. Let's denote the cost of the boots as B and the cost of the first pair of heels as H1, and the cost of the second pair of heels as H2.

We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2 * H1. We also know that the total cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots, so we can write the equation:

H1 + H2 = B - 5

Substituting the given values, we get:

$33 + 2 * $33 = B - 5

Simplifying the equation, we have:

$99 = B - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

$104 = B

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104.

The final answer is $104."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of ratios and algebraic manipulation. Let's denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x, as given in the problem statement.

We are told that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms, we get:

18x = 162

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can determine their current ages:

Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To determine the average guess, we can calculate the number of jelly beans each person estimated and then find the mean of these values.

Let's denote the number of jelly beans in the jar as x. The first person guessed 80 jelly beans. The second person's guess can be represented as 80 + 20 = 100. The third person's guess is 25% more than the first person's, which can be calculated as 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100.

Now, we can calculate the average of these guesses by adding them together and dividing by the number of guesses: (80 + 100 + 100) / 3.

To find the mean, we can simplify the expression: (80 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 280 / 3.

The average guess is 280 / 3 = 93.33.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93.33}$"
"To determine the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and the number of days in a week. Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can calculate the total daily care hours as follows:

Total daily care hours = Number of dogs * Time spent on each dog per day
Total daily care hours = 10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog
Total daily care hours = 5 hours/day

To find the total weekly care hours, we can multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week (7):

Total weekly care hours = Total daily care hours * 7
Total weekly care hours = 5 hours/day * 7 days/week
Total weekly care hours = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30.

We are given that the total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

x = 40

Now that we have determined the number of silver coins, we can easily calculate the number of gold coins by adding 30 to x:

x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

Thus, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we can analyze the given information using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the number of jewels Siobhan has as S, the number of jewels Aaron has as A, and the number of jewels Raymond has as R. We are given the following information:

1. R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)
2. A = R/2 + 5 (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
3. S = A - 2 (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)

We can substitute the expression for A from equation (2) into equation (3) to find S:

S = (R/2 + 5) - 2
S = (40/2 + 5) - 2
S = (20 + 5) - 2
S = 23

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the total points scored by Mike, we can break down his performance into two segments: the first 20 minutes and the subsequent 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To calculate this, we can find 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes and add it to the initial score.

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

Total points scored in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points

Now, we can find the total points scored by adding the points scored in both segments:

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9 points

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of yogurts consumed in 30 days. Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, we can calculate this as follows:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we must determine the cost of a single yogurt. The sale offers 4 yogurts for $5.00, so we can calculate the cost of one yogurt by dividing the total cost by the number of yogurts:

$5.00 ÷ 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Now, we can multiply the number of yogurts consumed by the cost per yogurt to find the total expenditure:

60 yogurts * $1.25 per yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurts over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75.00"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we can analyze the given information. John initially had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each, resulting in a total revenue of 13 * 15 = $195. He then spent $160 on 8 video games at $20 each, leaving him with $35. 

Let's denote the initial number of Lego sets as x. The total revenue from selling the Lego sets is $15x. Since John spent $160 on video games, we can set up the equation: 15x - 160 = 35. Solving for x, we get 15x = 195, and x = 13.

However, the question asks for the number of Lego sets John still has, which is the same as the initial number of Lego sets, as there is no information about any additional sets being sold or lost. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine John's running speed, we can employ the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. Given that John runs 60 miles in a week and 3 days, we can calculate his daily running time and then find his speed.

First, we need to find the total hours John runs in a week. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. Therefore, his total running time is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.

Now, we can calculate his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

Therefore, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour."
"To determine the total distance Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Given that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and her running speed is twice that of her skipping speed, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent on each activity as follows:

Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered while running and walking:

Distance covered while running = Speed * Time = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
Distance covered while walking = Speed * Time = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances covered while running and walking:

Total distance = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking
= 12 miles + 12 miles
= 24 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the age of Suzy's iPhone as S, Ben's iPhone as B, and Brandon's iPhone as D.

Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we have:

S = 1

It is also stated that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so we can express this as:

B = 2S
B = 2(1)
B = 2

Furthermore, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, which can be represented as:

D = 4B
D = 4(2)
D = 8

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to consider the increased throwing distance afforded by the gemstone. 

Given that Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet, and with the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther, we can express this as a ratio of throwing distances: 3:1. 

Let's denote the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone as 3x, where x is the distance she can throw without the gemstone. We know that 3x = 1200 feet, as calculated earlier. Solving for x, we get x = 1200 / 3 = 400 feet.

Now, we can find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames by subtracting the dragon's range from the maximum throwing distance with the gemstone: 3x - 1000 = 3(400) - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. After the guests took their pieces, 14 pieces remained. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

T - P = 14

Substituting the value of T, we get:

40 - P = 14

To solve for P, we can rearrange the equation:

P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the amount of chips you can consume, we need to calculate the remaining calories available in your daily target and then convert that to grams.

First, let's calculate the remaining calories: 2000 (daily calorie target) - 1800 (calories already consumed) = 200 calories.

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can find the number of servings you can have by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

To convert the number of servings to grams, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving (300g): 0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g.

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we can employ the following steps:

1. Determine the total revenue generated from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
Total Revenue = Number of Candles Sold * Price per Candle
Total Revenue = 20 * $2.00
Total Revenue = $40.00

2. Calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks:
Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, and he used 1 pound, the total cost is equivalent to the cost of 10 candles:
Total Cost = Number of Candles * Cost per Candle
Total Cost = 10 * $1.00
Total Cost = $10.00

3. Compute the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net Profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we need to determine the number of articles written on each day. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is equivalent to 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles on each day. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours, on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours, and on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days, we add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{104}$"
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as x.

We know that Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse and used 220 at work. After purchasing the package, she had 23 notes remaining. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she had initially is the sum of the notes in the package and the notes she had in her purse, which equals the sum of the notes she used at work and the remaining notes.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

80 + x = 220 + 23

Simplifying the equation, we get:

80 + x = 243

Subtracting 80 from both sides:

x = 163

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on ties, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of blue ties purchased and the cost of each type of tie.

First, we calculate the number of blue ties purchased. Given that John spent $200 on blue ties at $40 each, we can find the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
= $200 / $40
= 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:

Number of red ties = 2 x Number of blue ties
= 2 x 5
= 10

Next, we calculate the cost of a red tie, which is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie is:

Cost of a red tie = Cost of a blue tie + (50% of Cost of a blue tie)
= $40 + (0.5 x $40)
= $40 + $20
= $60

Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:

Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties x Cost of a red tie
= 10 x $60
= $600

Finally, we add the total amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the overall amount spent on ties:

Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
= $200 + $600
= $800

The final answer is: $800"
"To determine the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and division. Given that the wire was initially 4 feet long and then cut into pieces 6 inches long, we first need to convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches.

Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches is calculated as follows:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches) to determine the number of pieces:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that each floor contains 8 units and the building has 15 floors, the total number of units can be calculated as follows:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4:

Occupied units = Total units * (3/4)
Occupied units = 120 * (3/4)
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine Lloyd's weekly earnings from egg sales, we can employ a straightforward calculation. First, we need to establish the number of eggs produced per week and then convert that to dozens, as the selling price is given per dozen.

The daily egg production is 252 eggs, and there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced per week is:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we can convert the total number of eggs to dozens by dividing by 12:

1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by multiplying the number of dozens sold by the selling price per dozen:

147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

The final answer is: $294"
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to return, we can apply the concept of average speed. Since Tom travels at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 PM and then returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we can calculate the total time taken for the round trip.

First, we calculate the total distance traveled. Assuming the distance from 1 to 4 PM is the same as the distance from 4 to 1 PM, the total distance is:

Distance = 2 x 30 miles (since the distance from 1 to 4 PM is 30 miles)
Distance = 60 miles

Now, we can use the formula for average speed:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the total distance (60 miles) and the average speed (which is the harmonic mean of the two speeds), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the total time:

Total Time = Total Distance / Average Speed

The average speed is the harmonic mean of 10 mph and 6 mph, which can be calculated as:

Average Speed = (2 x 10 x 6) / (10 + 6)
Average Speed = 120 / 16
Average Speed = 7.5 mph

Now, we can calculate the total time:

Total Time = Total Distance / Average Speed
Total Time = 60 miles / 7.5 mph
Total Time = 8 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 8 hours to complete the round trip.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag, we can start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

30 * (1/4) = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day.

Let's denote the revenue from truck tires as T and the revenue from car tires as C. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

T = 6 * $60 = $360
C = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = T + C = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires, so the total revenue can be expressed as:

T = 0
C = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = T + C = $0 + $480 = $480

Comparing the revenues, we can see that the total revenue on Friday ($480) is less than the total revenue on Thursday ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue:

$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat had and then sum them up.

Given that Trixie had 12 kittens, and Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, we can express this relationship as an equation: P = 3T, where P represents the number of kittens Patchy had and T represents the number of kittens Trixie had. Since T = 12, we can substitute this value into the equation to find P: P = 3(12) = 36.

Now, we can find the total number of kittens by adding the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had: Total Kittens = P + T = 36 + 12 = 48.

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that Jean has 30 lollipops initially and consumes 2, the remaining number of lollipops is 30 - 2 = 28.

Now, we can calculate the number of bags by dividing the remaining lollipops by 2, as Jean intends to package 2 lollipops in each bag. This can be represented mathematically as:

Number of bags = Total remaining lollipops / Lollipops per bag
= 28 ÷ 2
= 14

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of times Peter can go to the movies, we can use a simple division problem. 

Let's denote the cost of a ticket as T and the cost of popcorn as P. We are given that T = $7 and P = $7. The total amount of money Peter has is $42. 

We can set up the equation: 

Total money = Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn
42 = T + P
42 = 7 + 7
42 = 14

Now, we can divide both sides by 14 to find the number of times Peter can go to the movies:

Number of times = Total money / (Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn)
= 42 / 14
= 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the remaining weight available for the boxes after accounting for the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck. This can be done by subtracting the combined weight from the bridge's weight limit:

Remaining weight available for boxes = Bridge's weight limit - Combined weight of driver and empty truck
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds

Next, we can divide the remaining weight available for boxes by the weight of a single box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded:

Maximum number of boxes = Remaining weight available for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 1245 / 15
= 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the original bill of $40.00. This can be done by multiplying the original bill by 0.25, which gives us $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.

Next, we add the delivery fees of $3.00 to the original bill, resulting in a subtotal of $40.00 + $3.00 = $43.00.

Then, we add the 25% fee to the subtotal, which we calculated earlier as $10.00. This gives us a total of $43.00 + $10.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the total, resulting in a final price of $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00.

Final answer: $57.00"
"To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we can employ a straightforward approach by adding the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries.

Let's denote the number of clusters as C and the number of raspberries in each cluster as R. We are given C = 6 and R = 20. The total number of raspberries (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = C * R + I

where I represents the number of individual raspberries. Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 6 * 20 + 67
T = 120 + 67
T = 187

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

The final answer is: $\boxed{187}$"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we can start by calculating the total number of oranges that are not good. This includes the bad, unripe, and sour oranges.

Let's denote the total number of oranges as 'T', the number of bad oranges as 'B', the number of unripe oranges as 'U', and the number of good oranges as 'G'. We are given that T = 25, B = 1, and U = 0.2T.

We can express the number of unripe oranges as 0.2T = 0.2 * 25 = 5.

Now, we can find the total number of oranges that are not good by adding the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges: B + U + G = 1 + 5 + G.

Since the total number of oranges is the sum of good and bad/unripe/sour oranges, we can express this as T = B + U + G. Substituting the known values, we get 25 = 1 + 5 + G.

Solving for G, we get G = 25 - 1 - 5 = 19.

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 19.

19"
"To determine the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to calculate the cost of the material, the construction, and the insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be expressed as 0.10 × $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two distinct periods of her employment: the initial 20 years with a fixed annual pension and the subsequent 10 years with a 5% increase in the pension value.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. The total amount she receives during this period is:

$50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

$1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years.

The total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years is the sum of the fixed annual pension and the 5% annual pension:

$50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
$50,000/year * 5% = $2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000
Total amount = $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000

To find the average annual pension, we can calculate the total amount she receives over the 30-year period and divide it by the total number of years:

Total amount = $1,000,000 + $525,000 = $1,525,000
Average annual pension = Total amount / Total years = $1,525,000 / 30 years = $50,833.33

The final answer is: $50,833.33"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month for 6 months. We can calculate the total amount she paid using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total Amount = (Number of Months) * (Monthly Payment)
Total Amount = 6 * $140
Total Amount = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. To calculate the monthly payment for the second half of the year, we need to find 10% of the original monthly payment and subtract it from the original amount:

10% of $140 = 0.1 * $140 = $14
Monthly Payment (second half) = $140 - $14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, we can calculate the total amount she paid using the same formula:

Total Amount = (Number of Months) * (Monthly Payment)
Total Amount = 6 * $126
Total Amount = $756

Now, we can find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by adding the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:

Total Amount = $840 + $756
Total Amount = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine the miles per gallon (mpg) that Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we can utilize the concept of fuel economy. Given that the car's tank holds 12 gallons and she has already consumed 4 gallons to fill it up, we can calculate the remaining capacity as 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate her current fuel economy as follows:

Fuel economy (mpg) = Total distance traveled / Total gallons consumed
= 100 miles / 4 gallons
= 25 miles per gallon

However, this is the fuel economy for the entire tank. To find the miles per gallon for the remaining 8 gallons, we can divide the remaining distance (100 miles) by the remaining gallons (8 gallons):

Fuel economy (mpg) = Total distance traveled / Remaining gallons
= 100 miles / 8 gallons
= 12.5 miles per gallon

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles per gallon on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To determine the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem into two components: the hours spent watching TV and the hours spent reading.

Let's denote the hours spent watching TV as 't' and the hours spent reading as 'r'. We are given that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and reads for half as long, so we can express 'r' as r = 0.5t. The total hours spent on these activities each time is t + r = t + 0.5t = 1.5t.

Since Jim performs this activity 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 1.5t * 3 = 4.5t.

To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4: 4.5t * 4 = 18t.

We are not given a specific value for 't', but we can express the total hours spent in 4 weeks in terms of 't': 18t.

However, since we are asked to provide a numerical answer, we need more information to determine the value of 't'. Assuming the problem intends to ask for the total hours spent in 4 weeks without specifying the value of 't', we can leave the answer in terms of 't'. 

However, since the question does not provide an option for an expression, we can assume that the question intends to ask for a numerical value. In this case, we can use the given information to make an assumption about 't'. Since the problem does not provide any other information, we can assume that 't' is a constant value. 

If we assume 't' is 2 hours (as given in the original problem), the total hours spent in 4 weeks would be 18 * 2 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of people sent by the schools, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Each school has two teams, consisting of a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, with five players on each team. This results in a total of 10 players per school. Since there are four schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

In addition to the players, each school has also sent a coach for each team, adding an additional 2 coaches per school. With four schools, the total number of coaches is 2 coaches per school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Therefore, the total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E.

We are given the following information:

1. D = 175
2. R = D - 35
3. E = 2R

We can substitute the expression for R from equation (2) into equation (3) to find the number of emeralds in terms of D:

E = 2(D - 35)
E = 2D - 70

Now, we can express the total number of gems as the sum of the individual types:

Total = D + R + E
Total = D + (D - 35) + (2D - 70)
Total = 4D - 105

Substituting the given value of D into the equation, we get:

Total = 4(175) - 105
Total = 700 - 105
Total = 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we can utilize the given ratio of students to teachers. The problem states that there are 5 students per teacher. 

Let's denote the number of teachers as 't'. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120. The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is 120 + 60 = 180.

We can set up the equation 5t = 180, where 't' represents the number of teachers. Solving for 't', we get t = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the number of teachers is 36.

The final answer is 36."
"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount as 'x'. Since Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, the total amount she receives is 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. We can set up the equation:

x + 40 = 100

To solve for x, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

x = 100 - 40
x = 60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To calculate Judy's weekly earnings, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the total number of classes she teaches in a week by the number of students per class and the charge per student.

First, we determine the total number of classes taught in a week. Judy teaches 5 classes per weekday, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday, bringing the total to 25 + 8 = 33 classes.

Next, we calculate the total number of students by multiplying the total number of classes by the number of students per class: 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

Finally, we multiply the total number of students by the charge per student to find Judy's weekly earnings: 495 students * $15/student = $7425.

The final answer is $7425."
"To determine the total number of instructions, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. Given that Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions as Recipe 1, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of instructions in Recipe 1. Since Recipe 2 has twice as many instructions, the number of instructions in Recipe 2 can be represented as 2x.

We are given that Recipe 1 has 20 instructions, so we can set up the equation:

x = 20

To find the number of instructions in Recipe 2, we can multiply x by 2:

Number of instructions in Recipe 2 = 2x
= 2(20)
= 40

Now, we can find the total number of instructions by adding the number of instructions in both recipes:

Total instructions = Number of instructions in Recipe 1 + Number of instructions in Recipe 2
= 20 + 40
= 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"

Total Amount = 3B + 4C

We are given that B = 43 and C = 23. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

Total Amount = 3(43) + 4(23)
Total Amount = 129 + 92
Total Amount = 221

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is $221.

Final answer: $221"
"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones over 3 months, we can break down the problem into two components: the principal amount and the interest.

The principal amount for each cell phone is $150, and Shiela is purchasing 5 units. Therefore, the total principal amount is 5 x $150 = $750.

The interest rate is 2% per month, which can be expressed as a decimal as 0.02. To calculate the interest for each month, we multiply the principal amount by the interest rate: $750 x 0.02 = $15.

Since the interest is charged for each month, we need to calculate the total interest for 3 months. The total interest is $15 x 3 = $45.

Now, we can calculate the total amount Shiela will pay each month by adding the principal amount and the interest: $750 + $45 = $795.

The answer is: $795"
"To calculate Artie's total revenue, we can apply the concept of rounding to the prices of each type of flower and then multiply the quantity sold by the rounded price. 

First, we round the prices to the nearest dollar: 
- Marigolds: $2.74 ≈ $3
- Petunias: $1.87 ≈ $2
- Begonias: $2.12 ≈ $2

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

The total revenue is the sum of the revenues from each type of flower: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.

"To determine the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can express the square footage of each level as a geometric sequence: 16, 8, 4, and 2.

The sum of a finite geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, a = 16, r = 1/2, and n = 4. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 * (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
= 16 * (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) / (1/2)
= 16 * (15/16) * 2
= 30

To find the average square footage, we divide the sum by the number of terms:

Average = S / n
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 7.5."
"To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

For the first 180 days, the puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days (365 - 180), the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is the sum of these two quantities:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we can analyze the given information. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can establish the following relationships:

Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D. Then, Sarah does 4D, and Raymond does 2D (half of Sarah's laundry).

We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

4D = 400

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides by 4:

D = 400 / 4
D = 100

Now that we know David does 100 pounds of laundry, we can find Raymond's laundry by multiplying D by 2:

Raymond's laundry = 2D
Raymond's laundry = 2(100)
Raymond's laundry = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the more cost-effective option for purchasing 18 flowers, we can calculate the total cost of each option.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
The cost per flower in this option is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower. To purchase 18 flowers, the total cost would be 18 * $0.8333 = $15.

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
The cost per flower in this option is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower. To purchase 18 flowers, the total cost would be 18 * $0.5 = $9.

Since $9 is less than $15, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the more cost-effective option.

The amount of money saved by choosing the better option is $15 - $9 = $6.

Final answer: $6"
"To calculate the cost of the grooming after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The original price of the grooming is $100, and the discount offered is 30%. 

The discount amount can be calculated as 30% of $100, which is equal to 0.3 x $100 = $30. 

To find the cost after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we can employ a straightforward approach. Initially, we have 24 liters of water. Two girls each receive 1/6 of the total amount, which can be calculated as:

(1/6) × 24 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total water they receive is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

Next, a boy receives 6 liters of water. To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total water received by the girls and the boy from the initial amount:

24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.

"To determine the number of stickers Charlie has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers. He then acquired 21 more stickers from a store and received 23 as a birthday gift, resulting in a total of 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers.

However, Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 to decorate a greeting card. To find the number of stickers he has left, we need to subtract the total number of stickers given away and used from the total number of stickers he initially had.

The number of stickers Charlie has left can be calculated as follows:

54 (total stickers) - 9 (given to sister) - 28 (used for decoration) = 17

Therefore, Charlie has 17 stickers left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can start by calculating Alex's weight. Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let G = Grace's weight
Alex's weight = 4G - 2

Given that Grace weighs 125 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Alex's weight = 4(125) - 2
Alex's weight = 500 - 2
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Now, we can find their combined weight by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{623}$"

Total number of thorns = b * r * t
Total number of thorns = 3 * 25 * 8
Total number of thorns = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

Now that we have found the number of games lost, we can determine the number of games won by adding 8 to x:

Number of games won = x + 8
= 7 + 8
= 15

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks, we can employ a simple arithmetic operation. Gene has been vacationing for 11 years, and he goes on 4 vacations per year. Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks can be calculated as follows:

Number of quilt blocks = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
= 11 years * 4 vacations/year
= 44 quilt blocks

The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the duration of the first ring as x. According to the problem, the second ring lasted three times as long as the first, so its duration is 3x. The third ring lasted half as long as the second, so its duration is (3x)/2.

The total duration of the alarm ringing is the sum of the durations of each ring. We can express this as an equation:

x + 3x + (3x)/2 = total duration

To find the total duration, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 2. We can rewrite the equation as:

(2x + 6x + 3x)/2 = total duration
(11x)/2 = total duration

Since the problem doesn't provide a specific duration for the alarm, we can't determine the exact total duration. However, we can express the total number of times the alarm rang as the sum of the number of rings for each duration:

Number of rings = (duration of first ring) + (duration of second ring) + (duration of third ring)
= x + 3x + (3x)/2
= x + 3x + 1.5x
= 4.5x

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the value of x. However, we can express the total number of times the alarm rang in terms of x.

Since the problem doesn't provide a specific value for x, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, we can express the total number of times the alarm rang as:

Total number of times the alarm rang = 4.5x

Since we can't provide a numerical answer, I will provide the correct option in a multiple-choice format:

The total number of times the alarm rang is best represented as 4.5x. Unfortunately, without knowing the value of x, we cannot provide a numerical answer."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can utilize the concept of compound interest. Since the company increases the salary by 10% every year, we can model this as an exponential growth process.

Initial salary = $600
Annual growth rate = 10% = 0.10

Using the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount after n years, P is the principal amount (initial salary), r is the annual growth rate, and n is the number of years.

We can calculate Sylvie's salary after 3 more years as follows:

Year 1: 
A = 600(1 + 0.10) = 600(1.10) = $660

Year 2: 
A = 660(1 + 0.10) = 660(1.10) = $726

Year 3: 
A = 726(1 + 0.10) = 726(1.10) = $798.60

Year 4: 
A = 798.60(1 + 0.10) = 798.60(1.10) = $878.46

Year 5: 
A = 878.46(1 + 0.10) = 878.46(1.10) = $966.30

Year 6: 
A = 966.30(1 + 0.10) = 966.30(1.10) = $1062.93

Year 7: 
A = 1062.93(1 + 0.10) = 1062.93(1.10) = $1169.23

Year 8: 
A = 1169.23(1 + 0.10) = 1169.23(1.10) = $1286.15

Year 9: 
A = 1286.15(1 + 0.10) = 1286.15(1.10) = $1414.77

Year 10: 
A = 1414.77(1 + 0.10) = 1414.77(1.10) = $1556.25

The final answer is: $1556.25"
"To determine the number of copies Harald sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as x. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, the number of copies Marilyn sold is 10x. The total number of copies sold is the sum of the copies sold by Marilyn and Harald, which is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

x = 8,000

"To determine the total cost of gift bags, we need to calculate the number of guests who will attend the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can find the number of guests who will attend by multiplying the total number of invited guests by 3/4.

Number of guests attending = (3/4) * 16
= 12

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we can calculate the total number of gift bags required as follows:

Total gift bags = 0.75 * 12
= 9

The cost of each gift bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost of gift bags can be calculated as:

Total cost = 9 * $2
= $18

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total amount of potato salad required for the picnic, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total consumption of adults and children separately and then summing the results.

First, we establish the consumption rate for adults and children. Given that an adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child consumes half as much (5 pounds), we can express this relationship as a ratio:

Adult consumption : Child consumption = 10 : 5 = 2 : 1

Now, we can calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children. There are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic.

Adult consumption: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds
Child consumption: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds

Total consumption = Adult consumption + Child consumption
Total consumption = 200 pounds + 25 pounds
Total consumption = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted the T-Rex should bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, the number of pets Marcia has can be represented as x + 2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so the number of pets Jan has can be represented as 3(x + 2).

The total number of pets can be calculated by adding the number of pets each individual has: x (Cindy) + (x + 2) (Marcia) + 3(x + 2) (Jan).

Simplifying the expression, we get: x + x + 2 + 3x + 6 = 5x + 8.

Given that Cindy has four pets, we can substitute x = 4 into the expression: 5(4) + 8 = 20 + 8 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the ages of the siblings. Let's denote the ages of Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James as A, J, C, and Y, respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Y = 10 (James is 10 years old)
2. C = Y + 1 (Corey is 1 year older than James)
3. A = C - 2 (Amy is 2 years younger than Corey)
4. J = A - 5 (Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy)

Substituting the values from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3), we get:
A = (Y + 1) - 2
A = Y - 1

Now, substituting the value of A from the above equation into equation (4), we get:
J = (Y - 1) - 5
J = Y - 6

Substituting the value of Y from equation (1) into the above equation, we get:
J = 10 - 6
J = 4

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by first determining Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles. We know that Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so we can express this relationship as:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2

Given that Lee's time is 38 seconds, we can solve for Gerald's original time:

38 = Gerald's time + 2
Gerald's time = 38 - 2
Gerald's time = 36 seconds

Now, we can calculate Gerald's new time after his diet improvement, which is a 10% increase in speed. To do this, we'll divide his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement):

Gerald's new time = 36 / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 32.73 seconds

Therefore, Gerald's new time for the 400-meter hurdles is 32.73 seconds.

The final answer is 32.73."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

Given that there are two cats for every dog, we can express the number of cats in terms of the number of dogs as C = 2D. Additionally, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, which can be represented as R = D + C - 12.

Substituting C = 2D into the equation for R, we get R = D + 2D - 12 = 3D - 12.

We are also given that the number of dogs is 60, so D = 60. Substituting this value into the equation for R, we get R = 3(60) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168.

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, the remaining 3/5 are girls. 

Let's calculate the number of girls: 

Total students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 * 200 = 80
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 * 120 = 80

Now, to find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
= 120 - 80

"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of potted plants she initially has. Since she has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, we can express this as a multiplication operation:

Total potted plants = 2 * 40
Total potted plants = 80

Next, we need to account for the plants she will give away. She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, which equates to 40 plants. To find the remaining number of potted plants, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total:

Remaining potted plants = Total potted plants - 40
Remaining potted plants = 80 - 40
Remaining potted plants = 40

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"

"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board, which is a quarter of the total pieces: $\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250$ pieces.

Next, we find the remaining pieces by subtracting the pieces placed by Poppy from the total: $1000 - 250 = 750$ pieces.

Then, we calculate the number of pieces her mom places on the board, which is a third of the remaining pieces: $\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250$ pieces.

Finally, we determine the number of pieces left by subtracting the pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces: $750 - 250 = 500$ pieces.

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{500}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies eaten by Cody and Amir, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Cody consumes three times as many cookies as Amir, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of cookies Amir eats as 'x'. Then, Cody eats 3x cookies.

Since Amir eats 5 cookies, we can set up the equation x = 5 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 5.

Now, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats by substituting the value of x into the expression 3x: 3(5) = 15 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir, we add the number of cookies each of them eats: 5 (Amir) + 15 (Cody) = 20 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total inner volume of the three boxes, we can calculate the inner dimensions of each box by subtracting the wall thickness from the outer dimensions. The outer dimensions of each box are given as 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the wall thickness is 1 inch.

The inner dimensions of each box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
V = Length x Width x Height
V = 3 x 4 x 2
V = 24 cubic inches

Since there are three identical boxes, the total inner volume of all three boxes is:
Total Volume = 3 x 24
Total Volume = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can start by calculating the total time spent watching TV on other days. 

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.

The sum of these times is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours. Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time spent watching on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To convert 1.5 hours to minutes, we multiply by 60, resulting in 90 minutes. Given that each episode is 30 minutes, we can find the number of episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing 90 minutes by 30 minutes.

This yields 90 / 30 = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. This year, he aims to bake twice as many cookies, resulting in 2x cookies. However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than intended, leading to a total of 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he is left with 2x + 15 - 5 cookies.

We can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110 to represent the situation. To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

2x + 10 - 10 = 110 - 10

This simplifies to:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 100/2

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to determine the total cost of the gas by multiplying the number of gallons purchased by the price per gallon. In this case, the total cost of the gas is:

Total Cost = Number of Gallons * Price per Gallon
Total Cost = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total Cost = $30.00

Next, we need to calculate the cashback amount by multiplying the number of gallons purchased by the cashback amount per gallon. The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon.

Cashback Amount = Number of Gallons * Cashback per Gallon
Cashback Amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback Amount = $2.00

Finally, we can calculate the total cost after the cashback rewards by subtracting the cashback amount from the total cost of the gas.

Total Cost after Cashback = Total Cost - Cashback Amount
Total Cost after Cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total Cost after Cashback = $28.00

Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we must first calculate the total number of roll-ups each individual consumed. 

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 (width) * 24 (length) = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 (width) * 14 (length) = 42

The total number of roll-ups is the sum of their individual amounts: 48 + 42 = 90

To find the average, we divide the total by 2: 90 / 2 = 45

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45.

Final answer: $\boxed{45}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of related rates, which involves finding the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. In this case, we want to find the total amount of water taken on by the boat.

Let's denote the distance Julia rows as x feet and the amount of water taken on as y liters. We are given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, so we can express this relationship as:

y = (2/10)x

We are also given that Julia rows at a constant rate of 1.25 feet per second. We can use the formula:

x = v*t

where v is the velocity (1.25 feet/second) and t is the time (in seconds). We know that Julia rows for 64 seconds, so:

x = 1.25*64
x = 80 feet

Now, we can substitute this value of x into the equation for the amount of water taken on:

y = (2/10)*80
y = 16 liters

Therefore, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can apply the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations.

"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can start by establishing the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and Brittany's phone. Let's denote the number of photographs on Jamal's phone as J and the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as B. We are given that J = 1800.

We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so we can express this relationship as J = 6B. Substituting J = 1800, we get 1800 = 6B.

Solving for B, we find B = 1800 / 6 = 300.

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks as D. We can express this relationship as B = 50D.

Substituting B = 300, we get 300 = 50D.

Solving for D, we find D = 300 / 50 = 6.

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. The cost per board is $10, and there are 10 boards, so the total cost is:

10 × $10 = $100

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The cost per board is $16, and there are 5 boards, so the total cost is:

5 × $16 = $80

Now, we add the total cost of both types of boards:

$100 + $80 = $180

Since the prices have gone up by 50%, the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 × 1.5 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 × 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is:

10 × $15 = $150

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is:

5 × $24 = $120

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts:

$150 + $120 = $270

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$270 - $180 = $90

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not explicitly given, we will assume the total parts in the ratio, which is 20.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

7/13 = x/20

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7 * 20 = 13x
140 = 13x

Now, we can divide both sides by 13 to isolate x:

x = 140 / 13
x = 10.77 (approximately)

So, Katy used approximately 10.77 teaspoons of sugar.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10.77}$"

"To determine the number of containers imported on the second day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as 'x'. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles on the second day can be represented as 5x.

We are given that the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

5x = 30

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 30 ÷ 5
x = 6

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we can break down the problem into two parts: finding their individual salaries and then summing them.

First, we need to calculate Adrien's current salary. Given that his salary increased by 30% from four years ago, we can express this as:

Adrien's current salary = Adrien's old salary + 0.3 * Adrien's old salary
= $40000 + 0.3 * $40000
= $40000 + $12000
= $52000

Next, we can find Lylah's old salary using the fact that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than hers. We can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
= $30769.23

Now, we can calculate Lylah's current salary by adding 40% of her old salary to her old salary:

40% of $30769.23 = 0.4 * $30769.23
= $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69
= $43077.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries:

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
= $52000 + $43077.92
= $95077.92

The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is $95077.92."
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to establish the number of sheets used per week. Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and each pad contains 30 sheets, we can calculate the total sheets used per week as follows:

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we multiply the sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month (approximately 4 weeks). This yields:

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

240"
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we can analyze their individual contributions.

"To determine the total hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we can break down her sleep patterns into individual days and calculate the cumulative total.

Let's denote the hours slept on Monday as M, Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, Thursday as Th, Friday as F, Saturday as Sa, and Sunday as Su. We are given the following information:

M = 8
T = M - 2
W = T - 2
Th = W + 1
F = Th + 1
Sa = F + 1
Su = Sa + 1

We can express these relationships in a table for clarity:

| Day | Hours Slept |
| --- | --- |
| M | 8 |
| T | 8 - 2 = 6 |
| W | 6 - 2 = 4 |
| Th | 4 + 1 = 5 |
| F | 5 + 1 = 6 |
| Sa | 6 + 1 = 7 |
| Su | 7 + 1 = 8 |

Now, we can calculate the total hours slept by summing the hours for each day:

Total hours = M + T + W + Th + F + Sa + Su
= 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
= 40

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 40 hours throughout the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we can break down her running into two segments: the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, and the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour.

The distance covered during the first segment can be calculated using the formula:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 10 miles/hour × 3 hours
= 30 miles

For the second segment, we can similarly calculate the distance covered:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 5 miles/hour × 4 hours
= 20 miles

The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of these two distances:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
= 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of fish sausages as 6 more than the number of chicken sausages. This can be represented algebraically as:

Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6

Given that the number of chicken sausages is 38, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, we can calculate the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages:

Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations.

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments, as well as the costs associated with the doctors' fees.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total time spent on patients:
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

2. Calculate the total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

3. Calculate the total revenue from doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

4. Calculate the total revenue:
Total revenue = Revenue from patients + Revenue from doctors
Total revenue = $100,000 + $30,000
Total revenue = $130,000

"To determine the miles walked on Wednesday, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the miles walked on Monday as M and the miles walked on Wednesday as W. We are given that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday (M = 4) and that he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday (T = 6M). The total miles walked from Monday through Wednesday is 41.

We can express the total miles walked as the sum of the miles walked on each day: M + T + W = 41. Substituting the given values, we have:

4 + 6M + W = 41

Since we know M = 4, we can substitute this value into the equation:

4 + 6(4) + W = 41

Expanding the equation, we get:

4 + 24 + W = 41

Combine like terms:

= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Semi-automatic cars / Total cars) * 100
= (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of babies as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We are given that there are twice as many worker bees as babies (W = 2B) and twice as many babies as queens (B = 2Q). We also know that the total number of bees is 700 (W + B + Q = 700).

We can substitute the expressions for W and B in terms of Q into the total equation:

2Q + 2(2Q) + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

2Q + 4Q + Q = 700

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of babies and worker bees:

B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200

W = 2B = 2(200) = 400

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine Jordan's potential earnings if he were to utilize his video game time for a part-time job, we must first calculate the total hours he would work in a week. Given that he dedicates 2 hours daily to video games, his weekly work hours can be calculated as follows:

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Next, we multiply the total hours worked in a week by his hourly wage of $10 to obtain his potential earnings:

14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week

Therefore, if Jordan were to substitute his video game time with a part-time job, he would earn $140 in a week.

Final answer: $140"
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items.

First, let's calculate the total cost of non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we calculate the tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of non-food items: $10 + $1 = $11

The total cost of non-food items with tax is $11.

The total cost of food items is the sum of the costs of milk and eggs: $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the total cost of non-food items with tax to the total cost of food items to get the overall total: $11 + $5 = $16

The total cost of John's purchases is $16.

Final answer: $16"
"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine the total expenses and subtract them from his total income. 

First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials required for 8 clients. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack.

Total cost of bleach = 8 clients * 2 bottles/client * $2/bottle = $32
Total cost of cloths = 8 clients * 1 pack/client * $5/pack = $40

Total expenses = Total cost of bleach + Total cost of cloths
Total expenses = $32 + $40
Total expenses = $72

Given that Kim's total income is $92, we can calculate his profit as follows:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field with 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year by multiplying the hectares by the number of pineapples per hectare and then accounting for the frequency of harvesting.

The calculation can be represented as:

Total pineapples per year = (hectares * pineapples/hectare) * (harvesting frequency per year)

Since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we can calculate the harvesting frequency per year as 4 (4 quarters in a year). Therefore, the calculation becomes:

Total pineapples per year = (10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare) * 4

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Total pineapples per year = 10 * 100 * 4
Total pineapples per year = 400 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 400 pineapples within a year.

400"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can calculate the number of pieces in each box and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of pieces in the first box as x. We know that the second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so its number of pieces is 3x. The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, which can be expressed as (1/4)x.

We are given that the first box has 500 pieces, so x = 500. Substituting this value into the expressions for the second and third boxes, we get:

Number of pieces in the second box: 3x = 3(500) = 1500
Number of pieces in the third box: (1/4)x = (1/4)(500) = 125

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
Total number of pieces = x + 3x + (1/4)x
= 500 + 1500 + 125
= 2125

Therefore, Johnny needs to pick up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we can break down the problem into distinct phases.

Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, in the next 6 hours, half of these bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees. This accounts for a total of 30 + 15 = 45 bees that have either left or returned by the end of the second 6-hour period.

In the subsequent 6 hours, twice as many bees as the initial 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. This brings the total number of bees that have left the hive to 30 + 60 = 90 bees.

Since 15 bees have already returned, the remaining bees that left the hive are 90 - 15 = 75 bees. These bees will return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 75.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the cost of an adult ticket as A and the cost of a child ticket as C. We are given that A = $12 and C = $10. Since Brittany's mom purchased 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost can be expressed as A + C. 

Given that the total cost is $22, we can set up the equation: A + C = 22. Substituting the values of A and C, we get 12 + 10 = 22, which is true. 

To find the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the total cost to the change she received. The change is $8, so the total amount given is A + C + 8. Substituting the values of A and C, we get 12 + 10 + 8 = 30.

Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of friends Charlie and Dorothy have. 

Let's denote the number of friends Dorothy has as 'D'. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can express this relationship as:

Charlie's friends = 3D

We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 3D

To solve for D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4, as James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

James' friends = 4D
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each individual to cover the distance between their residence and the school.

First, let's convert the distances to a common unit, feet. We'll use the conversion factor of 5280 feet per mile.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes for each person to cover the distance:

Steve's time: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute
Time = 36 minutes

Tim's time: Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the time Tim will be waiting for Steve at his house. This is the difference between their times:

Time Tim will wait = Tim's time - Steve's time
Time Tim will wait = 40 minutes - 36 minutes
Time Tim will wait = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Shawnda made, we can calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated. There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires. Additionally, there were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, contributing 3 * 3 = 9 tires. Lastly, there was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, adding 1 tire to the total. Therefore, the total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, we can calculate the total amount of money made by multiplying the total number of tires inflated by the cost per tire: 20 * 0.25 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the change Carl receives after purchasing 10 packs of cookies, we can employ the concept of unitary method. Each pack contains 6 cookies, and the cost of each cookie is $0.10. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the cookies by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then by the cost per cookie:

Total cost = (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack) * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we can find the change by subtracting the total cost from the $10 bill:

Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

Therefore, Carl receives $4 as change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and fractions.

Let's denote the original number of french fries in the pack as 'x'. We can then track the sequence of events:

1. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull's action is x - 7.
2. Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries consumed. The remaining fries after the pigeons' action is (x - 7) - 9 = x - 16.
3. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is 2/3(x - 16). The remaining fries after the raccoon's action is (x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16).
4. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This implies that (x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) - 1 = 5.

Now, let's solve for x:

(x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) - 1 = 5

Combine like terms and isolate x:

x - 16 - 2/3x + 32/3 - 1 = 5

Simplify the equation:

(3x - 48 - 2x + 32)/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 16/3 = 5

Add 16/3 to both sides:

x = 5 + 16/3

x = (15 + 16)/3

x = 31/3

x = 10.33

Since the number of french fries must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a french fry. However, in this case, the exact solution is 10.33, which is not a whole number. We should re-evaluate the steps to ensure accuracy.

Re-evaluating the steps, we find that the error occurred in the simplification process. Let's correct the steps:

(x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) - 1 = 5

Combine like terms and isolate x:

x - 16 - 2/3x + 32/3 - 1 = 5

Simplify the equation:

(3x - 48 - 2x + 32)/3 = 5

Combine like terms:

x - 16/3 = 5

Add 16/3 to both sides:

x = 5 + 16/3

x = (15 + 16)/3

x = 31/3

x = 10.33

However, we should re-examine the equation (x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) - 1 = 5. The correct simplification is:

(x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) - 1 = 5

(x - 16) - 2/3(x - 16) = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

3(x - 16) - 2(x - 16) = 18

Expand and simplify:

3x - 48 - 2x + 32 = 18

Combine like terms:

x - 16 = 18

Add 16 to both sides:

x = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we can calculate the total hours for each type of day and then sum them up.

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week. Similarly, he has two 2-hour classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, yielding a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is 9 * 16 = 144 hours. The total number of hours he spends attending classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays is 4 * 16 = 64 hours.

The total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is the sum of these two values: 144 + 64 = 208 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{208}$"
"To determine the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and add them together. 

First, we'll convert the length of the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls by dividing by 12:

300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, we'll convert the length of the croissants to feet by dividing by 12:

120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are already in feet, so no conversion is necessary:

60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:

10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

Therefore, the total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we must consider the monthly consumption of each ape species and then calculate the total requirement for the specified period.

The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, while the gorillas need 400 bananas per month. The baboons, however, need 100 bananas per month. To find the total monthly requirement, we can add these amounts together:

200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas per month

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the monthly requirement by 2 to find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran. 

Blake's distance can be calculated as 2 * 15 * 100 yards, since he runs back and forth 15 times. This simplifies to 3000 yards.

Kelly's distance can be calculated as 2 * 34 * 100 yards (for the initial back-and-forth runs) and 2 * 34 * 40 yards (for the runs to the 40-yard line and back). This simplifies to 6800 + 2720 = 9520 yards.

Since 9520 yards is greater than 3000 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 9520 - 3000 = 6520 yards.

The final answer is: 6520"
"To determine the total cost of Raphael's school supplies, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the pens: 4 pens × $1.50 = $6.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the notebooks: 2 notebooks × $4 = $8.

Lastly, we add the cost of the bond paper: $20.

Now, we can find the total cost by adding these amounts together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, Finn observed 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the current number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the total number of tadpoles initially observed.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see:
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that emerged) + 0 (tadpoles hiding under a rock) = 5

Therefore, Finn can see 5 tadpoles in the pond.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can apply the given information using basic algebraic manipulation.

Let's denote the initial depth of water on Monday as x. According to the problem, the depth on Tuesday is 7 feet more than the initial depth, so the depth on Tuesday can be expressed as x + 7.

The depth on Wednesday is two thirds of the depth on Tuesday, which can be written as (2/3)(x + 7). We are given that the depth on Wednesday is 16 feet, so we can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x + 7) = 16

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2 to isolate x + 7:

x + 7 = 16 * (3/2)
x + 7 = 24

Subtracting 7 from both sides yields:

x = 17

Now that we have the initial depth, we can find the depth on Tuesday by adding 7:

Depth on Tuesday = x + 7
= 17 + 7
= 24

However, we are asked for the depth on Wednesday, which we already calculated as 16 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we can analyze the information provided.

Let's denote the number of starfish caught by Anakin as S, the number of sea horses as H, and the number of clownfish as C. We are given the following information:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish (S = 10)
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught S - 5 starfish (S - 5)
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses (H = 6)
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught H - 3 sea horses (H - 3)
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish (C = 3)
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught C + 2 clownfish (C + 2)

We can now express the total number of fish caught by each person as follows:

Anakin's total: S + H + C = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: (S - 5) + (H - 3) + (C + 2) = (10 - 5) + 6 - 3 + 3 + 2 = 12

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is the sum of their individual totals: 19 + 12 = 31.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To calculate the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we can model the price increase using a geometric progression. The initial price is $20, and the common ratio is 1.20 (100% + 20% increase).

The formula for the nth term of a geometric progression is:

an = ar^(n-1)

where a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, a = $20, r = 1.20, and n = 36.

an = 20(1.20)^(36-1)
an = 20(1.20)^35
an ≈ 20(5.059)
an ≈ $100.98

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S_n = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)

where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a is the initial term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

S_36 = 20 * ((1.20)^36 - 1) / (1.20 - 1)
S_36 ≈ 20 * (5.059 - 1) / 0.20
S_36 ≈ 20 * 4.059 / 0.20
S_36 ≈ 20 * 20.295
S_36 ≈ $403.90

However, the more accurate method to calculate the price after 36 months is to use the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression.

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $403.90.

The final answer is $403.90."
"To determine the total value of all the toys, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We are provided with the following information:

1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

We can use substitution to solve for the cost of the doll (D) and the red car (R). Substituting A = $5 into the equation D = 3A, we get:

D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the cost of the red car (R) using the given information:

R = $4

To find the total value of all toys, we can calculate the cost of each type of toy and add them together:

Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the financial impact of hiring an accountant versus doing taxes oneself, we can analyze the situation using basic arithmetic and financial principles.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work by doing her taxes herself, resulting in a loss of $35 per hour. This translates to a total loss of 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

2. The accountant charges a flat fee of $90.

To find the net gain from hiring the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the accessories she purchased. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer.

Total cost = Cost of computer + Cost of scanner + Cost of CD burner + Cost of printer
Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102
Total cost = €1423

Given that Elvira's budget is €1500, we can calculate the remaining amount for her clothing by subtracting the total cost from her budget:

Remaining amount = Budget - Total cost
Remaining amount = €1500 - €1423
Remaining amount = €77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

Let's calculate the number of babysitting sessions required:

Number of eggs needed ÷ Number of eggs per session = Total babysitting sessions
15 ÷ 3 = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to obtain the required 15 eggs.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the relationship between Seth's and Brooke's ages. Let's denote Seth's current age as x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Brooke's current age can be represented as x/2.

In two years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in two years is given as 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides yields:

3x/2 = 24

Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

3x = 48

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

J = 2E + 2

We are given that Ethel has $8, so we can substitute E = 8 into the equation:

J = 2(8) + 2
J = 16 + 2
J = 18

Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

The final answer is $18."
"To determine the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the problem into two parts: weekdays and weekends. Pancho walks 20 miles per day on weekdays, which consist of 5 days. This can be represented as 5 * 20 = 100 miles. On weekends, he walks 10 miles per day, which consists of 2 days, resulting in 2 * 10 = 20 miles.

The total miles walked in a week can be calculated by adding the miles walked on weekdays and weekends: 100 + 20 = 120 miles.

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we can break down the costs of the individual components and calculate the overall cost.

The hat costs $25, and the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, which is 3 × $25 = $75. The pants, on the other hand, cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

Total Cost = Cost of Hat + Cost of Jacket + Cost of Pants
= $25 + $75 + $50
= $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"In the context of arthropod anatomy, the total number of legs can be calculated by multiplying the number of individuals by the number of legs per individual. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature:

- Spiders: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs
- Insects: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs
- Mutant invertebrates: 3 mutant invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information using algebraic expressions.

Let's denote the age of Sally Four as S4, Granny Red as GR, Sally Two as ST, and Sally Thirty-two as ST32. We are given the following relationships:

1. ST32 = 8
2. S4 = ST32 (since Sally Four and Sally Thirty-two are the same age)
3. GR = 2 * S4 (Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four)

We can substitute the value of S4 from equation (2) into equation (3) to find GR:

GR = 2 * S4
GR = 2 * 8
GR = 16

Now, we can find the age of Sally Two by using equation (1) and the relationship between Sally Two and Granny Red:

ST = GR - 3 (Sally Two is three years younger than Granny Red)
ST = 16 - 3
ST = 13

Finally, we can calculate the total age of the four birds by adding their ages:

Total Age = ST32 + S4 + GR + ST
Total Age = 8 + 8 + 16 + 13
Total Age = 45

The total age of the four birds is 45."
"To determine Jessica's annual debt payment, we need to calculate her monthly payment and then multiply it by 12. 

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment for her debts:
Minimum payment for student loans: $300
Minimum payment for credit card: $200
Minimum payment for mortgage: $500
Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, let's add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This is the amount Jessica pays per month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this amount by 12:
$1500 x 12 = $18,000

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To determine the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we can calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply it by the number of potatoes.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut one potato is 5 seconds. To add these values, we need to convert the time to cut the potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes. 

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Since the time to peel and cut each potato is the same, we can multiply the time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 potatoes * 1.5833 minutes/potato = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"To determine the amount Juan and his brother Carlos spent on lemons, we can employ a straightforward approach by analyzing the given information.

Let's denote the cost of lemons per gallon as L and the cost of sugar per gallon as S. We are given that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 and $2, respectively. The total cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is L + S = $3 + $2 = $5.

We also know that they sell each glass for $0.50 and obtain 20 glasses per gallon, resulting in a revenue per gallon of 20 * $0.50 = $10. The profit per gallon is $25, which is the difference between revenue and cost. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - (L + S) = $25

Substituting the value of L + S, we get:

$10 - $5 = $25
$5 = $25

This equation is not solvable as it implies an impossible scenario. However, we can re-evaluate the problem by considering the cost of lemons and sugar separately. Let's denote the number of gallons produced as G. The total revenue is $10G, and the total cost is $5G (L + S). The profit is $25, so we can set up the equation:

$10G - $5G = $25
$5G = $25

Dividing both sides by $5, we get:

G = 5

Now that we know the number of gallons produced, we can calculate the total cost of lemons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so the total cost of lemons is:

Total cost of lemons = L * G
= $3 * 5
= $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls on the team, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants: 240 - 80 = 160.

Next, we find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of Chinese boys from the total number of Chinese participants: 160 - 60 = 100.

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls on the team is 100.

The final answer is 100."
"To determine Zaid's remaining monthly income after his various expenses and donations, we can break down his expenditures and calculate the total amount spent.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000 dollars. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is (1/4) * 6000 = 1500 dollars.

Next, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is (1/3) * 6000 = 2000 dollars.

The total amount spent so far is 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars.

The remaining amount is 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is (1/2) * 2500 = 1250 dollars.

The amount left after donation is 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, for a total of 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

The amount left after these expenses is 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars.

Therefore, Zaid will have 350 dollars left after all these expenses and donations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"To determine the total number of crabs the three individuals have, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R.

Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can express this as B = 40.

We are also told that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which can be represented as M = B - 4.

Furthermore, Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so R = M + 10.

Substituting the expression for M into the equation for R, we get R = (B - 4) + 10.

Now, we can substitute the value of B into the equation for R: R = (40 - 4) + 10 = 46.

To find the total number of crabs, we add the number of crabs each person has: Total = B + M + R = 40 + (40 - 4) + 46.

Simplifying the expression, we get Total = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we can utilize the concept of linear multiplication. 

Lloyd's hourly wage is $10, and he worked a total of 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. 

Total earnings = (hourly wage) * (total hours worked)
= $10 * (5 + 8)
= $10 * 13
= $130

Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks is $130."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we can utilize the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner garnered 3/4 of the total votes, the remaining fraction of votes represents the proportion of votes the loser received.

Total votes = 80
Winner's votes = (3/4) * 80 = 60

To find the loser's votes, we can subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:

Loser's votes = Total votes - Winner's votes
= 80 - 60
= 20

Therefore, the loser received 20 votes."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the quantities of red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses can be expressed as 4x. Additionally, we know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which can be represented as 5x.

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation 5x = 200 to solve for x.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we have found the value of x, we can calculate the number of red roses by multiplying 4 and x:

Number of red roses = 4x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach using algebraic equations.

Let's denote Jan's current age as J, Mark's current age as M, and Jean's current age as E. We are given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

From the problem statement, we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This can be expressed as:

M - 2 = (J/2) + 5

Substituting J = 30 into the equation, we get:

M - 2 = (30/2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have found Mark's current age, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's age, since Jean is two years older than Mark:

E = M + 2
E = 22 + 2
E = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we can calculate the total time taken by each team.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 seconds per runner, and with four runners, their total time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's time can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Time = (n/2) * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, n = 4, a1 = 60, and an = 51. 

Time = (4/2) * (60 + 51) 
Time = 2 * 111 
Time = 222 seconds

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

"To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we can utilize the concept of discrete uniform probability. Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of 1/6. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, resulting in a probability of 3/6 = 1/2.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2, as there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of the 6 possible outcomes. Assuming the die is rolled independently, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Let x be the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother.
Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, the number of apples picked by Jenna is x/2.

The total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is the sum of their individual quantities, which can be represented as:

Total apples = x + x/2

To simplify this expression, we can factor out x:

Total apples = x(1 + 1/2)
Total apples = x(3/2)

We are given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, so we can substitute x = 20 into the equation:

Total apples = (20)(3/2)
Total apples = 30

Therefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can start by calculating the total number of straw pieces used for the hamsters and rabbits. 

Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as 'r'. Since there are 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats is 3r. Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw used for the rats is 6 * 3r = 18r.

The total straw used for the hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50, and the total straw used for the rabbits is 20. The total straw used for all the small rodents is 160. We can set up the equation:

18r + 50 + 20 = 160

Combine like terms:

18r + 70 = 160

Subtract 70 from both sides:

18r = 90

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 5

Since there are 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 3r = 3 * 5 = 15.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can utilize the formula for simple interest: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and t is the time period in months.

Given that Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can calculate the interest for 3 months as follows:

I = P * r * t
I = $100 * 0.02 * 3
I = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict:

Amount to be paid = P + I
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is $30x. The total cost consists of the cost per bag ($20) and the transportation cost ($2 per bag), so the total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

30x - 22x = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8x = 400

Dividing both sides by 8, we find:

x = 400 / 8
x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost per person, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by 3.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and the cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. Therefore, the cost of the food can be calculated as:

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the rides. Since there are 2 rides, each costing $33, the total cost of the rides is:

Total cost of rides = 2 * $33
Total cost of rides = $66

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all expenses by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by 3:

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To determine the total number of peaches John collects, we can employ the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. 

First, we convert the time from hours to minutes, as the rate of peach collection is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equivalent to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we multiply the time in minutes by the rate of peach collection per minute: 180 minutes x 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the daily insect consumption of the duck flock, we can utilize the concept of weekly consumption and divide it by the number of days in a week. Given that the ducks require 3.5 pounds of insects per week, we can calculate the daily consumption as follows:

Weekly consumption / Number of days in a week = Daily consumption

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, the ducks need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to sustain themselves.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we can break down the problem into several steps. 

First, we calculate the net change in the number of trees per year. Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Since Tom starts with 50 trees, we can calculate the total number of trees he has after 10 years by adding the net gain to the initial number of trees:

50 trees + (8 trees/year * 10 years) = 50 trees + 80 trees = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we can multiply 130 by 0.3:

130 * 0.3 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

130 trees - 39 trees = 91 trees

Therefore, Tom has 91 trees left after 10 years.

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the number of pink plastic flamingos, we can break down the problem into steps. 

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos. On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. The remaining number of pink plastic flamingos is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection, making the total number of pink plastic flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6, as they were the ones taken back by the neighbors on Saturday.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we can calculate the difference between the amount of money she has and the total cost of the crayons.

The cost of 5 crayons is 5 × $2 = $10.

Violetta has $20.

$20 - $10 = $10

Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 in change.

The final answer is $10."
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we can utilize the given information to establish a cost equation. Let's denote the cost of a pen as 'p'. Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we can express this relationship as:

p = cost of a pencil + cost of an eraser
p = $1.20 + $0.30
p = $1.50

Now, we can calculate the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a single pen by 8:

Cost of 8 pens = 8p
= 8 * $1.50
= $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants, with each restaurant receiving 2 pounds, we can calculate the total amount of carrots distributed as follows:

Total amount of carrots distributed = Number of restaurants * Pounds per restaurant
= 40 * 2
= 80 pounds

Now, we can find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the total amount distributed from the total amount available:

Number of pounds of carrots that will not be used = Total amount of carrots available - Total amount of carrots distributed
= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can utilize the principle of set theory, specifically the concept of the complement of a set. The total population of Soda can be represented as the union of the male and female populations, with the remaining individuals belonging to the child population.

Let's denote the total population as P, the number of males as M, the number of females as F, and the number of children as C. We are given:

P = 23786
M = 8417
F = 9092

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the number of children as:

C = P - (M + F)

C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, there are 6277 children in Soda."
"To determine the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has, we can break down the problem into three distinct intervals and calculate the cumulative total.

Let's denote the initial number of cards as x. In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times this amount, which is 3x. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, resulting in 3x - 20 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2(3x + (3x - 20)).

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has after the three months:

Total = Initial cards + Cards collected in the first month + Cards collected in the second month + Cards collected in the third month
Total = x + 3x + (3x - 20) + 2(3x + (3x - 20))
Total = x + 3x + 3x - 20 + 6x - 40
Total = 13x - 60

We are given that Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Total = 13(20) - 60
Total = 260 - 60
Total = 200

Therefore, Elaine now has 200 Pokémon cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts. First, we need to find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Let's denote the number of sentences for each publisher as x. We know that x + x = 1000, since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. Solving for x, we get:

2x = 1000
x = 1000 / 2
x = 500

Now that we know Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher, we can calculate his earnings from each publisher. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, his earnings from Publisher A are:

500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, his earnings from Publisher B are:

500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

To find Mark's total weekly earnings, we can add his earnings from both publishers:

Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
= 2500 cents + 5000 cents
= 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur receives daily, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the morning and afternoon water intake separately. 

Morning water intake: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon water intake: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total daily water intake: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur receives 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we can break down the problem into two components: his weekly earnings and the one-time award.

First, let's calculate his weekly earnings before the award. Since he makes $2000 per week, his total earnings for the year would be:

Weekly earnings: $2000
Number of weeks in a year: 52

Total earnings before award = Weekly earnings * Number of weeks
Total earnings before award = $2000 * 52
Total earnings before award = $104,000

Next, we need to add the one-time award of $5,000 to his total earnings. Since the award was given on the first day of the year, it's already included in his earnings for the year.

Total earnings = Total earnings before award + Award amount
Total earnings = $104,000 + $5,000
Total earnings = $109,000

The final answer is: $109,000"
"To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. 

First, we need to calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes, and there are 10 acres, the total tons of grapes produced is:

10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons

Next, we know that each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced can be calculated as:

50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Thus, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down his cheese consumption into three categories: lunch, breakfast, and dinner.

Carl's lunch consumption can be calculated as 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

For breakfast, Carl used one more slice of cheese per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. Given that he had 3 omelets, his breakfast cheese consumption is 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Carl's dinner consumption is a fixed amount, as he used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used by adding the slices from each meal: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of pens in the blue bags: 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens.

Next, we calculate the number of pens in the red bags: 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens.

Now, we add the number of pens of each color: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens.

Therefore, Janet now has 98 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{98}$"
"To determine the required score on the sixth test, we can utilize the concept of weighted averages. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we can calculate the average of the remaining five scores and then find the required score to achieve the desired overall average.

First, let's calculate the sum of the remaining five scores: 
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, we assume the lowest score is 71. To find the average of the remaining four scores, we divide the sum by 4: 
(367 - 71) / 4 = 296 / 4 = 74

Now, we know that the desired average is 93, and there are six tests in total. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 
(5 * x + 74) / 6 = 93

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 6: 
5x + 74 = 558

Now, we can isolate x by subtracting 74 from both sides: 
5x = 484

Finally, we can divide both sides by 5: 
x = 484 / 5
x = 96.8

So, Brinley needs a score of 96.8 on the sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final answer is 96.8."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can calculate the total distance covered in each period and then sum them up.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks, covering a total distance of 5 * 4 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, covering a total distance of 2 * 3 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered in both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then summing the results.

First, we establish the weight of a single chocolate bar as 40g. Given that there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as:

25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Next, we consider the weight of a single candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, the weight of a single candied apple is 40g / 2 = 20g. With 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

Now, we sum the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to obtain the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of cakes she bought on each day:

On Monday, she purchased 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she acquired 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which can be expressed as 3 × 4 = 12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she acquired 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which can be expressed as 5 × 12 = 60 cakes.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cakes by adding the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76.

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and establishing the equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the cost of one cup as 'c'. We are told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, twenty dozen cups will be 240 cups.

The total cost of 240 cups can be expressed as 240c. We are also given that this is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

240c = 6000 - 1200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

240c = 4800

To find the cost of one cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:

c = 4800 / 240

c = 20

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation based on her earnings from babysitting and lawn mowing.

Let's denote the number of babysitting sessions as 'b' and the number of lawn mowing sessions as 'l'. We know that Sara earns $5 per babysitting session and $4 per lawn mowing session. The total amount she needs to earn is $50.

We can set up the equation: 5b + 4l = 50

We also know that Sara already has $10 saved, so we need to find the minimum number of sessions required to cover the remaining amount of $40.

Since Sara needs to earn $40, we can set up the equation: 5b + 4l ≥ 40

We can solve for 'b' in terms of 'l' using the first equation: 5b = 50 - 4l

Substituting this expression for 'b' into the second equation, we get: 5(50 - 4l) + 4l ≥ 40

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 250 - 20l + 4l ≥ 40

Combine like terms: 250 - 16l ≥ 40

Subtract 250 from both sides: -16l ≥ -210

Divide both sides by -16 and flip the inequality sign: l ≤ 13.125

Since Sara cannot mow a fraction of a session, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn at least 14 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. We are given that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected is 42, with red chickens producing 3 eggs per day and white chickens producing 5 eggs per day. This can be represented by the equation:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking around the perimeter of the local park, we can apply the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Since Gary walks at a constant speed of 3 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the perimeter of the park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. According to the problem, the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, which can be expressed as x + 50. The total number of customers on the first two days is the sum of the customers on each day, which is x + (x + 50). We are given that the total number of customers on the third day is 500. Since the third day's customer count is the sum of the first two days, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) + y = 500

However, we are not given the value of y, which represents the number of customers on the third day. To find y, we need to recognize that the problem states the third day's customer count is 50 more than the first day. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500

Combine like terms:

3x + 100 = 500

Subtract 100 from both sides:

3x = 400

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 133.33

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of customers on the third day by adding 50 to x:

y = x + 50
y = 133.33 + 50
y = 183.33

Rounding to the nearest whole number, since we cannot have a fraction of a customer, we can approximate y as 183.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{183}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. Therefore, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation:

2x - 16 = 4y

We also know that the small pool has lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation:

x - 16 = y

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation, we get y = x - 16.

Substituting y = x - 16 into the first equation, we get:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

Adding 64 to both sides, we get:

2x + 48 = 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get:

48 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 24

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation y = x - 16:

y = 24 - 16
y = 8

Therefore, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

Since Lori's hourly wage is $8.00, we can divide the total cost by her hourly wage to find the number of hours she needs to work:

Number of hours = Total cost ÷ Hourly wage
= $352.00 ÷ $8.00
= 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to purchase the shoes and belt.

Final answer: 44"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay and subtract it from the initial amount borrowed.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is calculated as 10% of $2000, which is 0.10 * $2000 = $200.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is the sum of the initial amount and the additional amount: $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Since Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay as $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220.

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
= 4 + 7
= 11

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
= 4 + 11
= 15

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that Harriet's current age is 21 years, we can determine the ages of the other two individuals based on the provided relationships.

Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can express Zack's age as 2 * Harriet's age, which is 2 * 21 = 42 years. Similarly, since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, we can express Adrian's age as 3 * Harriet's age, which is 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years can be calculated by summing their ages and dividing by 3:

(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

Therefore, the average age of the three individuals in three years will be 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the number of points Jojo scored, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of points Jojo scored as J, Naomi scored as N, Yuri scored as Y, and Brianna scored as B.

We are given the following information:

1. N = 68
2. Y = (1/2)N + 10
3. B = N + 17
4. N + Y + B + J = 251

Substituting the expressions for Y and B into the fourth equation, we get:

N + ((1/2)N + 10) + (N + 17) + J = 251

Combine like terms:

(3/2)N + 27 + J = 251

Substitute N = 68:

(3/2)(68) + 27 + J = 251

42 + 27 + J = 251

69 + J = 251

J = 182

Therefore, Jojo scored 182 points.

The final answer is: 182"
"To determine the total time spent by Carmen on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles, we can employ the concept of arithmetic addition. 

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles: 3 puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles: 8 puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on both activities to obtain the total time: 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

"To determine the current amount of water in the tank, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters. This can be calculated as follows:

Initial amount of water = 120 liters
Water used = 90 liters
Water left = Initial amount of water - Water used
Water left = 120 - 90
Water left = 30 liters

Next, we are told that Celine collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. So, we multiply the remaining water by 2:

Rainwater collected = 2 * Water left
Rainwater collected = 2 * 30
Rainwater collected = 60 liters

Finally, we add the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank:

Total water in the tank now = Water left + Rainwater collected
Total water in the tank now = 30 + 60
Total water in the tank now = 90 liters

Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums. 

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. 

Let's break down the problem:

The company spends $15,000 in the first year. In the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent in the first year is $15,000. The total amount spent in the second year is $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is the sum of the amounts spent in each year. We can express this as:

Total Amount = $15,000 + $5,000

Total Amount = $20,000

The final answer is: $20,000"

Carlos' cost: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90
Benji's cost: 5 hours * $18/hour = $90

Total cost = Carlos' cost + Benji's cost
Total cost = $90 + $90
Total cost = $180

Therefore, the total cost for their rentals is $180."
"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to consider the time taken for each leg of the journey. The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

The total number of days for the round trip can be calculated by adding the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days for the round trip is 9 days.

"To determine the percentage chance of picking a water type card from James' collection, we must first calculate the total number of cards and the number of water type cards after the specified transactions.

Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards, totaling 90 cards. He then loses 8 water type cards, reducing the total to 90 - 8 = 82 cards. Subsequently, he acquires 14 grass type cards, increasing the total to 82 + 14 = 96 cards. The number of water type cards remains unchanged at 40.

The probability of selecting a water type card can be calculated as the ratio of the number of water type cards to the total number of cards, expressed as a percentage: (40 / 96) * 100.

To calculate this, we can simplify the fraction 40 / 96 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This yields 5 / 12.

Now, we can calculate the percentage: (5 / 12) * 100 = 41.67%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance of picking a water type card is 42%.

The final answer is 42."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we can break down the costs as follows:

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Next, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Finally, adding the 2 sauces for $0.50 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

The upgrade for $3.00 adds to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which reduces the total owed to $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we can apply the concept of combined work rates. 

Let's denote the rate at which Kalinda places pieces as K and the rate at which her mom places pieces as M. We are given that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, so K = 4. Since her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, we can express her rate as M = K/2 = 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute.

The combined rate at which they place pieces is the sum of their individual rates, which is K + M = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time required to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (6 pieces per minute).

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60.

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we first need to calculate the initial number of watermelons ready for harvest. Given that 30% of the total 120 watermelons were ready, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 0.3 * 120
= 36

Next, we need to find the number of watermelons remaining on the farm after Ashlyn took 36 home. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of watermelons taken from the total:

Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36
= 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we can calculate 3/4 of 84:

Number of watermelons ready for harvest = (3/4) * 84
= 63

Finally, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons:

Number of watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we can break down the expenses into three components: the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

The tax can be calculated by finding 10% of the cost of the cars: 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the registration fee per car: 12 cars * $1,000 per car = $12,000.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the fleet of cars is $276,000."
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of shells Robert collects on Monday as R and the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday as K. We are given that R = 20.

Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can express this relationship as K = R + 5. Substituting R = 20 into this equation yields K = 20 + 5 = 25.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This can be represented as K_Tuesday = 2 * K, where K_Tuesday denotes the number of shells collected on Tuesday. Substituting K = 25 into this equation gives us K_Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of insects in the garden, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote the number of ants as A and the number of bugs as B. We are told that B = A/2. We are also given that A = 50.

To find the total number of insects, we can add the number of ants and bugs. However, since we already know the number of ants, we can directly calculate the number of bugs and then add them together.

Number of bugs = A/2 = 50/2 = 25

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins still sunbathing, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of penguins that left: 36 penguins * (1/3) = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean, and another 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner. 

The total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

Now, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

"To determine the number of vines required to meet Steve's tomato consumption needs, we must consider the total weekly tomato requirement and the production capacity of a single vine.

Given that Steve consumes 6 tomatoes per day, his weekly consumption is 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes. Since his girlfriend consumes half of this amount, her weekly consumption is 42 / 2 = 21 tomatoes.

The total weekly consumption is 42 + 21 = 63 tomatoes. With each vine producing 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines required can be calculated as follows:

Number of vines = Total weekly consumption / Production per vine
= 63 / 3
= 21

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to meet his and his girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption needs.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can apply the concept of division to find the minimum number of whole pizzas required to meet the demand. Since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we can divide the total number of slices needed (20 friends * 4 slices per friend) by 8.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza
= (20 friends * 4 slices per friend) / 8 slices per pizza
= 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza
= 10 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order at least 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we can utilize the concept of a geometric series. Since Ram can create one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we can model this situation using a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/5.

Let's denote the initial number of pens as 'a' and the common ratio as 'r'. We know that 'a' is 25 and 'r' is 1/5. The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where S is the sum of the series.

However, in this case, we are dealing with a finite number of pens. We can calculate the number of full pens Ram can make by dividing the initial number of pens by 5 and then adding the remaining pens.

25 / 5 = 5 full pens

Since the remaining pens will also be used to make new pens, we can calculate the number of remaining pens as follows:

25 - (5 * 5) = 25 - 25 = 0

However, this approach assumes that the remaining pens will be used to make full pens. Since the problem doesn't specify this, we can consider the remaining pens as a separate entity. In this case, we can simply add the number of full pens to the initial number of pens.

Total pens = 25 (initial pens) + 5 (full pens) = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of money Johnny had after a year, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. 

Given that the initial amount of $20 was tripled, we can express this as an exponential function: 

A = P * (1 + r)^n, 

where A is the final amount, P is the principal amount ($20), r is the growth rate (in this case, 200% or 2, since the amount tripled), and n is the number of periods (1 year).

However, in this scenario, the growth rate is not explicitly stated as a decimal, but rather as a percentage increase. To apply the formula, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: r = 200% / 100 = 2.

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula: 

A = 20 * (1 + 2)^1 
A = 20 * 3 
A = 60 

Therefore, Johnny had $60 after a year.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the sum of the ages of the three girls, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as J + 5 - 2. Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages.

Joan's age = J + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
Mary's age = J + 5 - 2 = 20 + 5 - 2 = 23

Now, we can calculate the sum of their ages:
Sum of ages = J + (J + 5) + (J + 5 - 2)
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit A, which is 30% of the total number of students. This can be expressed as 0.3 * 1000.

Let's calculate this value: 0.3 * 1000 = 300 students.

Next, we subtract the number of students who exited through A from the total number of students to find the remaining students: 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

Then, we calculate the number of students who exited through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students. This can be expressed as (3/5) * 700.

Let's calculate this value: (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

Finally, we subtract the number of students who exited through B from the remaining students to find the number of students who exited through C: 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as 'r'. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can express John's candies as 2r.

We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:

2r = 54

To find the value of 'r', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

r = 54 ÷ 2
r = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' candies by adding 6 to Robert's total:

James' candies = r + 6
= 27 + 6
= 33

To determine how many more candies John has than James, we can subtract James' total from John's total:

Difference = John's candies - James' candies
= 54 - 33
= 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

Initially, we note that both individuals possess a total of 3 books (2 for Dolly and 1 for Pandora). When they read each other's books, the total number of books they will read can be calculated by adding the number of books each person has to the number of books they will read from the other person.

Mathematically, this can be represented as: Total books read = (Dolly's books) + (Pandora's books) + (Dolly reads from Pandora's books) + (Pandora reads from Dolly's books)

Substituting the given values, we get: Total books read = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 5 books by the end.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total time Mike spends writing per week, we can break down the problem into manageable components.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pages written per week. Since Mike receives and sends 3 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages written per week is 3 * 5 = 15 pages.

Since Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing per week by multiplying the total number of pages written by the time it takes to write one page. This gives us 15 pages * 6 minutes/page = 90 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 1.5 hours writing per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.5}$"
"To determine the number of minutes Jason has left in his phone plan, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total minutes used for his daily call with his boss. Since Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days, the total minutes used for this call can be calculated as:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used is the sum of these two:

450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan to find the remaining minutes:

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic algebraic manipulations and logical deductions.

Let's denote the number of fries Griffin initially had as G, the number of fries Kyle took as K, the number of fries Billy took as B, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as x, and the number of fries Colby took as C.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 24
2. K = 5
3. B = 2K
4. C = K - 3
5. G - K + x + C = 27

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

24 - 5 + x + (5 - 3) = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 - 5 + x + 2 = 27

Combine like terms:

21 + x = 27

Subtract 21 from both sides:

x = 6

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 6 fries.

Final answer: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. According to the problem, this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since the question asks for the number of fish in each aquarium, and both aquariums have the same number of fish, the answer is simply 14.

Final answer: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we can employ the concept of total labor hours and apply a discount to the total cost.

First, we need to determine the total labor hours worked. Since the makeup artist works 6 hours per day for 4 days a week, we can calculate the total hours worked per week as:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Next, we multiply the total hours worked per week by the number of weeks the movie takes to finish, which is 5 weeks:

24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

Now, we can calculate the total cost without the discount by multiplying the total hours worked by the hourly wage:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

To apply the 10% discount, we can calculate 10% of the total cost:

0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to determine the amount Jean paid:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

The final answer is: $27,000"
"To determine the cost per person, we must first calculate the total cost of all the party supplies. This can be achieved by summing the individual costs of the various items.

Total cost = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)
Total cost = $96

Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, there are 3 people in total. To find the cost per person, we can divide the total cost by the number of people.

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $96 / 3
Cost per person = $32

Therefore, each person paid $32.

The final answer is $32."
"To calculate the total cost of the onions, we can utilize the concept of unitary method, which involves multiplying the number of units (bags) by the weight of each unit (pounds) and then multiplying the result by the cost per unit (dollars).

Let's apply this method:

Number of bags (n) = 4
Weight per bag (w) = 50 pounds
Cost per pound (c) = $1.50

Total cost (C) = n * w * c
= 4 * 50 * $1.50
= 4 * 50 * 1.50
= 4 * 75
= $300

Therefore, the total cost of the onions is $300."
"To determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister, we can calculate the total calories from each individual's cookie consumption.

Let's denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday as S_Monday and the number of cookies eaten by her sister on Monday as S_Sister_Monday. Similarly, we'll denote the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Tuesday as S_Tuesday and the number of cookies eaten by her sister on Tuesday as S_Sister_Tuesday.

Given that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, we can express this as:

S_Monday = 4 * S_Sister_Monday

Given that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday and Tuesday as follows:

S_Sister_Monday = 5
S_Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26

Now, we can find Sue's cookies on Monday:
S_Monday = 4 * 5 = 20

Next, we can calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister:
Total cookies eaten by Sue = S_Monday + S_Tuesday = 20 + 26 = 46
Total cookies eaten by her sister = S_Sister_Monday + S_Sister_Tuesday = 5 + 13 = 18

Finally, we can calculate the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:
Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories
Calories consumed by Sue more than her sister = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can utilize the concept of proportions. Given that the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as 20 students per class * 3 classes = 60 students.

Since the school is 50% girls, the number of girls is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls. We are also given that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - (15 + 12) = 3 girls.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in the class. Since there are 20 students in each class, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the current number of apps on Travis' tablet, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to subtract the number of apps deleted from the initial number of apps: 61 - 9 = 52. 

Next, we add the number of apps downloaded to the result: 52 + 18 = 70.

Therefore, the current number of apps on Travis' tablet is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: the number of wolves and cougars he killed each night.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W1 and the number of cougars killed last night as C1. We are given that W1 = 10 and C1 = 15.

We are also given that Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, so the number of wolves killed today (W2) is 3 times the number of cougars killed today (C2). We can express this as W2 = 3C2.

Additionally, we know that the number of cougars killed today (C2) is three fewer than the number of cougars killed last night (C1), so C2 = C1 - 3.

We can now substitute the value of C1 into the equation for C2: C2 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now that we have the value of C2, we can find W2 by multiplying C2 by 3: W2 = 3 * 12 = 36.

Finally, we can find the total number of animals Rick killed by adding the number of wolves and cougars killed each night: Total = W1 + W2 + C1 + C2 = 10 + 36 + 15 + 12 = 73.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the floor Bill is currently on, we can apply a simple arithmetic operation. 

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

Let's represent Bill's starting floor as 'x'. The equation to find the current floor is: 4x + 6.

Substituting x = 3 into the equation, we get: 4(3) + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide, which is 30% less than Mitchel's 30 times. This can be expressed as:

Anne's rides = Mitchel's rides - (30% of Mitchel's rides)
= 30 - (0.3 * 30)
= 30 - 9
= 21

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, we can calculate Robert's rides as:

Robert's rides = 4 * Anne's rides
= 4 * 21
= 84

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"To determine the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows. Initially, there were 20 cows in each of the 20 stalls, resulting in a total of 20 * 20 = 400 cows. After adding the 40 new cows, the total becomes 400 + 40 = 440 cows.

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can calculate the number of cows in each stall by dividing the total number of cows by 20: 440 / 20 = 22 cows per stall.

To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8: 22 * 8 = 176 cows.

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 of the stalls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{176}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we can employ the concept of place value and basic arithmetic operations. 

First, let's convert each type of currency to a common unit, such as dollars. We have:

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, we can sum these values: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank.

Final Answer: The final answer is $45."
"To determine the total weight of the redwood, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds, we can calculate the total weight of the tree by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section.

First, we need to find the total number of sections in the 200-foot tall redwood. This can be achieved by dividing the total height by the length of each section:

Total weight = Number of sections × Weight per section
= (200 feet / 10 feet per section) × 400 pounds per section
= 20 sections × 400 pounds per section
= 8000 pounds

However, we must account for the 30% of the wood that was eaten by the termites. To do this, we can calculate the weight of the wood that was consumed:

Weight of wood eaten = 30% of 8000 pounds
= 0.30 × 8000 pounds
= 2400 pounds

Now, we can find the weight of the remaining wood by subtracting the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight:

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight - Weight of wood eaten
= 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
= 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To determine the total amount Nancy owes, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The cost of the overdue books can be calculated as the product of the number of books and the per-book fine, which is $0.50. This yields a total of $4.00. Additionally, a flat fee of $2.00 is incurred for having at least one book over a week overdue. Therefore, the total amount owed is the sum of these two values.

Total Amount Owed = (Number of Books * Per-Book Fine) + Flat Fee
Total Amount Owed = (8 * $0.50) + $2.00
Total Amount Owed = $4.00 + $2.00
Total Amount Owed = $6.00

The total amount Nancy owes is $6.00."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of apples and bananas each individual has.

Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as J and the number of bananas Andrea has as A. We are given the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: A = J + 8
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: A = 0.5J
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: J = A + 4

We can use substitution to solve for J and A. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
0.5J = J + 8
0.5J - J = 8
-0.5J = 8
J = -16 (This is not a feasible solution, as the number of apples cannot be negative. We will revisit this step.)

Let's try a different approach. We can substitute equation (3) into equation (2):
A = 0.5(J + 4)
A = 0.5J + 2

Now, we can equate this expression for A with equation (1):
0.5J + 2 = J + 8
0.5J - J = 8 - 2
-0.5J = 6
J = -12 (This is also not a feasible solution, as the number of apples cannot be negative.)

Let's try another approach. We can equate equations (1) and (3):
J + 8 = J + 4
8 = 4
This is a contradiction, indicating that the initial assumption that we can solve for J and A using the given equations is incorrect.

However, we can still find the number of fruits by using the fact that Andrea has 52 apples. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from 52:
J = 52 - 8
J = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find the number of bananas he has by adding 4:
J = 44 + 4
J = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
A = 48 / 2
A = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Total number of fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 48 (Jamal's apples) + 24 (Andrea's bananas) + 48 (Jamal's bananas)
Total number of fruits = 52 + 48 + 24 + 48
Total number of fruits = 172

The final answer is: $\boxed{172}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies she is making and then divide that by 12, as 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of flour needed:

Let x be the total amount of flour needed in cups.
2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 66 cookies

Cross-multiplying, we get:
2 * 66 = 12x
132 = 12x

Dividing both sides by 12:
x = 132 / 12
x = 11

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate two thirds of the total number of pennies in the cup. This can be achieved by multiplying the total number of pennies (9,300) by the fraction 2/3.

Let's perform the calculation:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we can find the total dollar amount by multiplying the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

The final answer is: $62"
"To determine the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the initial number of marbles by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles. 

Next, we add the marbles Maddison received from her friend to the initial total: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H.

Given that Chris has 6 trees, we can express this as C = 6.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so we can express this as F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so we can express this as H = 2F + 5 = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard: H - F = 11 - 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the girls have, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic addition. 

Let's denote the amount of money Carmen has as C, Samantha has as S, and Daisy has as D. We are given the following information:

1. C = $100
2. S = C + $25
3. D = S + $50

We can substitute the value of S from equation (2) into equation (3) to find D:
D = (C + $25) + $50
D = C + $75

Now, we can substitute the value of C and D into the original equation:
C + S + D = $100 + (C + $25) + (C + $75)
Combine like terms:
C + S + D = 2C + $100 + $25 + $75
Simplify:
C + S + D = 2C + $200

Subtract C from both sides:
S + D = C + $200

Now, substitute the value of S from equation (2) into the equation:
(C + $25) + D = C + $200
Subtract C from both sides:
$25 + D = $200

Subtract $25 from both sides:
D = $175

Now that we have the values of C, S, and D, we can find the total amount of money the girls have:
Total = C + S + D
Total = $100 + $125 + $175
Total = $400

The final answer is: $400"
"To determine the total price of the house, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee as a percentage of the selling price.

Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = $17,500
Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = $42,000

Total additional fees: $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

Total price of the house: $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

To find the difference between the total price of the house and Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

The selling price of the house is $400,000. Mr. Tan paid a transfer fee of 3% of the selling price, which is $12,000 (0.03 x $400,000). He also paid a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price, which is $20,000 (0.05 x $400,000). Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

The total amount paid by Mr. Tan is the sum of the transfer fee, brokerage fee, and the loan amount: $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

To find the net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time required from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into its constituent parts. 

First, we calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil to 400 degrees. The initial heating time is 20 minutes, and then it takes 40% longer to reach the desired temperature. 

The additional time to reach 400 degrees can be calculated as 40% of the initial heating time: 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.

Next, we need to consider the time required to cook the chicken. It is given that this time is 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

Finally, we add the heating time and the cooking time to obtain the total time: 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"To determine the total amount spent on all ads, we can calculate the cost of newspaper ads and television ads separately and then sum them up.

The cost of newspaper ads can be calculated as follows: 
Cost per ad = $5
Number of ads = 50
Total cost of newspaper ads = Cost per ad * Number of ads
Total cost of newspaper ads = $5 * 50
Total cost of newspaper ads = $250

The cost of television ads can be calculated as follows: 
Cost per ad = $75
Number of ads = 15
Total cost of television ads = Cost per ad * Number of ads
Total cost of television ads = $75 * 15
Total cost of television ads = $1125

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads: 
Total amount spent = Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads
Total amount spent = $250 + $1125
Total amount spent = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Given that the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total, and half of these balls are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of M&Ms Mary received, we can calculate the number of M&Ms in each bag and sum them together.

Let's denote the number of M&Ms in the first bag as x. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so its M&Ms can be represented as x + 12. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so its M&Ms can be represented as x/2.

The total number of M&Ms Mary received is the sum of the M&Ms in each bag: x + (x + 12) + (x/2).

To simplify the expression, we can combine like terms: 
x + x + 12 + x/2 = 2x + 12 + x/2

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2. We can rewrite x as 2x/2:
2x/2 + x/2 + 12 = 3x/2 + 12

Now, we can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
3x + 24 = 2x + 12

Subtracting 2x from both sides:
x + 24 = 12

Subtracting 24 from both sides:
x = -12

However, the number of M&Ms cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The problem states that the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag. This implies that the second bag has at least 300 M&Ms. Therefore, we can set up an inequality to represent the number of M&Ms in the second bag:
x + 12 ≥ 300

Subtracting 12 from both sides:
x ≥ 288

Since the number of M&Ms must be a whole number, the minimum value of x is 288.

Now, we can recalculate the total number of M&Ms Mary received:
Minimum number of M&Ms in the first bag: 288
Minimum number of M&Ms in the second bag: 288 + 12 = 300
Minimum number of M&Ms in the third bag: 288/2 = 144

Total minimum number of M&Ms: 288 + 300 + 144 = 732

The total number of M&Ms Mary received is at least 732.

The final answer is: $\boxed{732}$"
"To determine the total number of windows, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of windows in the bedrooms and the number of additional windows.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each bedroom has 2 windows and there are 3 bedrooms in each of the 2 houses, we can express this as:

2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we consider the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. There are 4 additional windows in each house, so for 2 houses, we have:

2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the overall total:

12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

Therefore, the total number of windows is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the change the cashier should give the mother, we need to calculate the total cost of the items purchased. 

The total cost is the sum of the individual item prices: $4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $14.99.

To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: $20 - $14.99 = $5.01.

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $5.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by calculating the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"To determine the total cost of the seeds, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of packets for each type of seed by its respective cost and then summing the results.

The cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40/packet = $800
The cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on the seeds.

The final answer is: $3200"
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can break down the information into components and calculate each part separately.

Let's denote the number of lines in the first scene as x. Since the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, we can express this as an equation: x = 2 * 54. Solving for x, we get x = 108. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 * (80 - 32) = 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 * (48 - 24) = 5/8 * 24 = 15.

Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter D: 24 - 15 = 9.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total time required to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's define the time taken for small holes as 's' and large holes as 'l'. We are given that s = 3 minutes and l = 10 minutes.

The total time for small holes is 30s, and the total time for large holes is 15l. Therefore, the total time can be represented as:

Total time = 30s + 15l
= 30(3) + 15(10)
= 90 + 150
= 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Total time (in hours) = 240 minutes / 60
= 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Let's denote their current ages as x and y, respectively. We are given that their sum is 20, so we can express this as an equation:

x + y = 20

In 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10, respectively. The sum of their ages in 10 years can be represented as (x + 10) + (y + 10). By applying the associative property of addition, we can simplify this expression to:

x + y + 10 + 10
x + y + 20

Since we know that x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the expression:

20 + 20
40

Therefore, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the given information and derive the value of Sam's current age.

Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. The problem states that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, which can be expressed as:

R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation:

R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation, we get:

R + 9 = 3S + 27

Substituting R = 6S into the equation, we have:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides yields:

3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam's current age is 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Peter's purchases, we can employ the principle of arithmetic addition. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles: 20 popsicles * $0.25 = $5.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50 = $2.00.

Now, we add the costs together: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00."
"To determine the total number of spots, we can start by calculating the number of spots on the mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing 70 by 2, which equals 35 spots per mamba.

Given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, we can calculate the total number of spots as follows:

Total spots = (40 cobras * 70 spots) + (60 mambas * 35 spots)
Total spots = 2800 + 2100
Total spots = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we can divide the total number of spots by 2:

Half the number of spots = 4900 / 2
Half the number of spots = 2450

Therefore, half the number of spots is 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of individuals attending the event. This includes the team members, coaches, and their guests. The number of team members is given as 12, and there are 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24. 

The total number of individuals is the sum of team members, coaches, and guests: 12 + 3 + 24 = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we can calculate the total number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of individuals by 3: 39 / 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 * $15 = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas for the soccer game.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we can calculate the total space occupied by the topaz gemstones and then subtract this from the total length of the necklace to find the space occupied by the beads.

Let's denote the number of topaz gemstones as n. Since each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length occupied by the gemstones is n inches. The total length of the necklace is given as 25 inches. Therefore, the space occupied by the beads is 25 - n inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, the number of beads used can be calculated as:

Number of beads = (Total length of necklace - Total length of gemstones) / Length of each bead
= (25 - n) / (1/4)
= (25 - n) * 4
= 100 - 4n

We are given that Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, so n = 8. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Number of beads = 100 - 4(8)
= 100 - 32
= 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic sequences. 

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, Alani doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 20 = 40 stories.
Braylen doubled his stories from the first week, so he wrote 2 * 40 = 80 stories.
Margot doubled her stories from the first week, so she wrote 2 * 60 = 120 stories.

Now, let's add the number of stories each child wrote in both weeks:
Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

The total number of stories written is 60 + 120 + 180 = 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the brother's age in 3 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the brother's current age is twice Ann's age, we can express this relationship as:

Brother's current age = 2 * Ann's current age
Brother's current age = 2 * 9
Brother's current age = 18

To find the brother's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3
Brother's age in 3 years = 21

Therefore, the brother's age in 3 years will be 21."
"To determine the amount of money Kelly will have left after purchasing the can of pop, we can calculate the total value of her coins and subtract the cost of the pop.

Kelly has 5 quarters, which is equivalent to 5 x $0.25 = $1.25. She also has 2 dimes, which is equivalent to 2 x $0.10 = $0.20. The total value of her coins is $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45.

The can of pop costs $0.55. To find out how much money Kelly will have left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total value of her coins:

$1.45 - $0.55 = $0.90

Therefore, Kelly will have $0.90 left.

The final answer is: $0.90"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we can start by finding the total number of stars on the flag. 

Let's denote the number of 5-star rows as 'x'. Since there are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars, the total number of stars can be represented as:

8 * 3 + 6 * 2 + 5 * x = 76

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 + 12 + 5x = 76

Combine like terms:

36 + 5x = 76

Subtract 36 from both sides:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds and the delivery trucks have a capacity of 2000 pounds, we can calculate the number of trucks needed as follows:

Let's denote the number of trucks as 'n'. The total weight of the flagstones (80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone) should be less than or equal to the total capacity of the trucks (2000 pounds). We can set up the inequality:

80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone ≤ 2000 pounds/truck

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

6000 pounds ≤ 2000n

Now, divide both sides by 2000:

n ≥ 6000 / 2000

n ≥ 3

Since 'n' represents the number of trucks, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the minimum number of trucks required to transport 80 flagstones is 3.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can utilize the formula for time, which is given by:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane as follows:

Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2
= 30 miles/hour

Now, we can apply the formula to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
= 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as x.

We are given that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

We are also told that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. This can be expressed as the equation:

x = 10(22 + 17)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 10(39)

x = 390

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390.

The final answer is: $\boxed{390}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we first need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.

Next, we need to subtract the number of chocolate bars allocated to the adults. Each adult receives 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars allocated to adults is 4 * 6 = 24.

The remaining chocolate bars are 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we divide the remaining chocolate bars among the 8 children. To find out how many each child will receive, we calculate 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Susan's earnings, we can calculate the total minutes she works and then divide that by the interval at which she earns money. 

First, we need to find the total minutes she works. Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

Total minutes = (11 hours - 8 hours) * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes (for the half-hour pause)
= 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes
= 180 minutes + 30 minutes
= 210 minutes

Next, we can divide the total minutes by the interval at which she earns money, which is 10 minutes. 

Earnings = Total minutes / 10 minutes
= 210 minutes / 10 minutes
= 21

Therefore, Susan earns $21 for the online task.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the fourth round, we can analyze the situation as follows:

Initially, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, and Tony has 2 times more points than Mike. This can be represented as:

- Mike's points: 21
- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 2 * 21 = 42

In the fourth round, each player receives an additional point if their current score exceeds 20. Since Mike and Tony have scores above 20, they receive an extra point each. Jim's score is below 20, so he does not receive an extra point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

To find the total points of all three players, we add their scores together:

Total points = Mike's points + Jim's points + Tony's points
= 22 + 18 + 43
= 83

The final answer is: $\boxed{83}$"
"To determine the number of unwashed oranges, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, making him 4 years old. The total number of oranges washed by the sons is the sum of their ages, which is 8 + 4 = 12.

Given that Will initially bought 15 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges can be calculated as follows:

Unwashed oranges = Total oranges - Oranges washed
= 15 - 12
= 3

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total count of activities Darren has completed over the two days, we can calculate the number of each exercise performed on both days and then sum the results.

On the first day, Darren performed 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he increased his pushups by 20 (100 + 20 = 120), decreased his squats by 10 (50 - 10 = 40), and doubled his dumbbell presses (20 * 2 = 40).

To find the total count of activities, we can add the number of each exercise performed on both days:

Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities is the sum of these three values: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The final answer is: $\boxed{370}$"
"To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg. With 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find the number of weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

Therefore, the rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we can calculate the total number of crates sold and then subtract this from the target.

Let's break down the sales data:

- On Tuesday, Sam sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Total crates sold = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can calculate the difference as follows:

Difference = Target - Total crates sold
= 120 - 65
= 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the total cost of the desk, we can model the bidding process as an arithmetic sequence. The initial bid is $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50. Since there are 4 bids in total (including Carmen's), we can calculate the final bid as follows:

Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a_1 = $200 and the common difference as $d = $50. The number of terms (n) is 4.

The final bid can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

Substituting the values, we get:

a_4 = $200 + (4 - 1)($50)
a_4 = $200 + 3($50)
a_4 = $200 + $150
a_4 = $350

Since Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, her bid is the fourth bid, which is $350. To find the total cost, we add her bid to the initial bid:

Total cost = Initial bid + Final bid
Total cost = $200 + $350
Total cost = $550

The final answer is: $550"
"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of driving and the bonus.

The cost of driving can be calculated by multiplying the total miles driven per year by the cost per mile. Since John drives 60 miles per day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back) and works 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. With 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year. At a cost of $2 per mile, the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

In addition to the driving cost, John also receives a $150 monthly bonus. With 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Therefore, the total cost of driving per year is $30,000 (driving cost) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference between his desired exercise time and the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Let's denote the time Peter exercised on Monday as M and the time he exercised on Sunday as S. We are given that M = 16 minutes and S = 23 minutes. The desired exercise time on Tuesday is twice the combined time of Monday and Sunday, which can be expressed as 2(M + S).

First, we calculate the combined time: M + S = 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Now, we can find the desired exercise time on Tuesday: 2(M + S) = 2(39) = 78 minutes.

To find the additional time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we subtract the combined time from the desired time: 78 - 39 = 39 minutes.

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{39}$"
"In the context of tabloid production, the number of pieces of paper required can be determined by considering the folding and printing process. When a tabloid is folded in half, it creates two distinct sides: the left side and the right side. Each side has an equal number of pages, which is half the total number of pages in the tabloid.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pages per side as follows:

Number of pages per side = Total number of pages / 2
= 32 / 2
= 16

Since each side requires 16 pages, and we have two sides, the total number of pieces of paper required is:

Total pieces of paper = Number of pages per side * 2
= 16 * 2
= 32

However, this calculation assumes that each page is printed on both sides of the paper. In reality, the number of pieces of paper required is equal to the total number of pages, as each page is used only once.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Annika initially brought $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which equates to $50 / 2 = $25. Additionally, she spent an extra $10 on rides. 

The total amount spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total spent from the initial amount: $50 - $35 = $15.

Therefore, Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can employ a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as x and the number of books sold in the second year as y.

We are given that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Therefore, we can express this relationship as x = 2y.

We also know that the total number of books sold in the first two years is 200, and the total number of books is 250. This implies that the number of unsold books is 50. Hence, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can write the equation: x + y = 200.

Substituting x = 2y into the equation, we get 2y + y = 200, which simplifies to 3y = 200. Solving for y, we find y = 200/3.

Now that we know the number of books sold in the second year, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold by the price per book: 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"To calculate Watson's total earnings for April, we can employ the concept of total weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the month. Since Watson works 10 hours a day, five days a week, his daily earnings are $10/hour * 10 hours/day = $100/day.

Given that he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Since April has 30 days, we can calculate the total number of weeks in the month as:
30 days / 7 days/week = 4.29 weeks (approximately)

To account for the partial week, we can multiply the weekly earnings by the whole number of weeks (4) and then add the earnings for the remaining days:
$500/week * 4 weeks = $2000
$2000 + ($100/day * 2 days) = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be:
$2200 + $300 = $2500

The final answer is: $2500"
"In this scenario, we can calculate the number of people John lost to by multiplying the total number of participants (20) by the percentage of people he lost to (0.2, or 20%).

20 * 0.2 = 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning, which is two-thirds of the total daily production. This can be represented as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Next, we find the number of loaves left after the morning sales by subtracting the morning sales from the total daily production:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we can calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon by dividing the remaining loaves by 2:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we can use the concept of proportional weight loss. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate his weekly weight loss rate as follows:

Weekly weight loss rate = Total weight loss / Number of weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weekly weight loss rate = 2 pounds/week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 8/2
x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"To determine the total savings, we can calculate the original cost of the items and the discounted cost, then find the difference.

The original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $13 = $26.
The original cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total original cost is $26 + $2 = $28.

The discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is 2 × $11 = $22.
The discounted cost of 4 packets of milk is 4 × $0.5 = $2.
The total discounted cost is $22 + $2 = $24.

The savings can be calculated as the difference between the original cost and the discounted cost: $28 - $24 = $4.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total number of new limbs the Lots-of-Limbs Serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we can analyze the growth pattern of the extra arms and legs separately.

The person grows an extra arm every 3 days, so in 15 days, they will experience 5 growth cycles of 3 days each. This can be represented as 15 / 3 = 5.

Similarly, the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, so in 15 days, they will experience 3 growth cycles of 5 days each. This can be represented as 15 / 5 = 3.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 + 3 = 8.

Therefore, the person will grow a total of 8 new limbs after 15 days.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the amount Theo needs to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we must first calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased.

The cost of 6 business suits can be calculated as 6 * $100 = $600. Additionally, the cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Furthermore, the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of the items purchased so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget for the trip is $6000, and he wishes to save $2000, leaving him with $6000 - $2000 = $4000 for expenses, including gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the daily egg consumption of the family. Three individuals consume 3 eggs each day, resulting in a total of 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day. The remaining two individuals consume 2 eggs each day, contributing a total of 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

The combined daily egg consumption is 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7, as there are 7 days in a week. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Quinn's age as Q, Jane's age as J, and Trent's age as T. Based on the given information:

1. Quinn is 30 years old, so Q = 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so J = Q - 3.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so T = J + 5.

Substituting the value of Q into the equation for J, we get J = 30 - 3 = 27. Then, substituting the value of J into the equation for T, we get T = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach by utilizing the given information and applying basic algebraic techniques.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46 years old. Therefore, we can express Noah's current age as:

N = 46 + 6
N = 52

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since the population six years ago was half of the current population, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2)P = 3000N

Substituting the value of N into the equation, we get:

(1/2)P = 3000(52)
(1/2)P = 156,000

To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

P = 156,000 * 2
P = 312,000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is 312,000.

The final answer is: 312,000"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to consider the total number of people invited and the number of people who are unable to attend due to illness and prior commitments.

First, we calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, resulting in 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Next, we subtract the 8 people who are unable to attend due to illness: 24 - 8 = 16.

We also need to account for the 1/4 of the 8 people who had prior commitments. This is equivalent to 8 / 4 = 2 people. Subtracting these individuals from the total number of people who were supposed to attend: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total weight of marbles, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. We know that Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. To find 2/5 of 20, we can multiply 20 by 2/5, which is equivalent to 20 * (2/5) = 8. Therefore, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. The total number of marbles Solomon has now is the sum of the marbles he bought and the marbles his father gave him: 20 + 8 = 28 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. The store already had 50 marbles, so the total number of marbles is 50 + 28 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kilograms, we can find the total weight by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble: 78 * 2 = 156 kilograms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool (6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft), we can substitute these values into the formula:

V = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
V = 120 cubic feet

Since the cost is $0.1 per cubic foot, the total cost to fill the pool can be calculated as:

Total Cost = V x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is $12."
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can utilize the given information to establish a system of equations. Let's denote the number of boys as B, the number of girls as G, and the number of nongendered children as N.

We are given that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, so we can express this relationship as G = 3B. Additionally, we know that the number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, which can be represented as N = (1/10)B.

We are also given that the number of boys is 30, so B = 30. We can use this information to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

First, we can find the number of girls: G = 3B = 3(30) = 90.

Next, we can find the number of nongendered children: N = (1/10)B = (1/10)(30) = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: Total = B + G + N = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can utilize the concept of ratios. Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of electric poles.

Let's denote the number of electric poles as x. Since the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, we can write the proportion as:

1/3 = x/45

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1 × 45 = 3x
45 = 3x

Next, we can divide both sides by 3 to isolate x:

x = 45 ÷ 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the total number of people at the party as 'T'. We know that 25 men and 15 women were initially present, so we can express this as:

T = 25 (men) + 15 (women)

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who departed as:

Number of people who left = (1/4)T

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party, which allows us to determine the number of men who left:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

Given that 3 men and a total of 10 people left the party, we can set up an equation to find the total number of people who left:

3 (men) + x (women) = 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Therefore, 7 women left the party. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the cost of the pen, we can analyze the given information using basic algebra. Let's denote the cost of the magazine as M and the cost of the pen as P.

From the given information, we know that the magazine costs half as much as the book, which costs $4. This can be expressed as:

M = 1/2 * 4
M = 2

We are also told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we can express the cost of the pen as:

P = M - 1
P = 2 - 1
P = 1

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we can start by calculating the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. 

Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so the total number of pencils Jam has is 3 * 24 (assuming each box has 24 pencils) + 2 = 74.

Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together, the total number of pencils is 74 + 46 = 120.

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed.

120 / 24 = 5

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the combined effects of cooling and dilution. 

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, which requires 5 ice cubes (65 / 13 = 5). Each ice cube reduces the coffee's strength by 12 milliliters, resulting in a total reduction of 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters.

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, further weakening the coffee. 

The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the reduction due to cooling and the reduction due to dilution: 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of ratios. The given information states that 2 old records are traded for 1 new record. This establishes a ratio of 2:1, where 2 old records are equivalent to 1 new record.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as x. Since each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record, the total number of old records traded is 2x.

We are also given that 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. Since each person gets 1 new record, the total number of new records is indeed 7. However, we need to consider the ratio of old records to new records. The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, and we know that 5 people traded a total of 2x old records for 7 new records.

We can set up a proportion to represent this situation:

2x / 7 = 2 / 1

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 7 * 2

2x = 14

x = 14 / 2

x = 7

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 7 old records.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of junior and senior programmers, and then finding their respective monthly salaries.

First, we know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the number of people who initially boarded the bus at the terminal, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x.

We know that 5 people got on at the first stop, and 7 people got off at the second stop. Additionally, 8 people got on at the second stop. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is x + 5 + 8 - 7 = x + 6.

Since we are given that there were 20 people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation x + 6 = 20 to represent the total number of people on the bus after the second stop.

Solving for x, we get:

x + 6 = 20
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can analyze the sequence of events:

Initially, Oscar has 24 lollipops. He consumes 2 on his way to school, resulting in 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops. Then, he distributes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops. 

Subsequently, Oscar purchases twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. This brings his total to 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. After consuming 3 lollipops that night, he is left with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops. Finally, he consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To determine the time required to fully charge the phone, we can utilize the concept of linear charging rates. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can establish a proportion to calculate the time needed to achieve 100% charge.

Let's denote the time required to charge 100% as 't' minutes. We can set up the following proportion:

1% charge / 3 minutes = 100% charge / t minutes

To solve for 't', we can cross-multiply and simplify:

t = 3 * 100
t = 300 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

t = 300 minutes / 60
t = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take 5 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to calculate the total rewards earned. Since the customer gets $1 off for every $20 spent, and they spent $80, we can calculate the rewards as follows:

Rewards = Total Spent / 20
Rewards = 80 / 20
Rewards = 4

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, we subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 
Amount Paid = Total Spent - Rewards
Amount Paid = 80 - 8
Amount Paid = 72

Therefore, the customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we must consider the tax implications of each option. 

Job A offers a fixed hourly wage of $15, resulting in an annual salary of $30,000. With a 20% total tax rate, the tax amount would be $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B, on the other hand, provides an annual salary of $42,000, but this amount is subject to a property tax of $6,000. After deducting the property tax, the net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. With a 10% tax rate on the net income, the tax amount would be $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Consequently, the net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Comparing the net pay for both jobs, we can see that Job B offers a higher net pay rate of $32,400 compared to Job A's $24,000.

The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"

"To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we can apply the concept of compound percentage change. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price for the first year. The initial price is $8, and it increases by 50%. This can be represented as:

New price = Initial price + (Initial price * Increase percentage)
New price = $8 + ($8 * 0.50)
New price = $8 + $4
New price = $12

Next, we calculate the decrease in the stock price for the second year. The new price is $12, and it decreases by 25%. This can be represented as:

New price = Old price - (Old price * Decrease percentage)
New price = $12 - ($12 * 0.25)
New price = $12 - $3
New price = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:

Total value = Number of shares * New price
Total value = 8 * $9
Total value = $72

Therefore, the final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To determine the number of hot dogs John ate more than Luke, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L and the number of hot dogs John ate as J.

Given that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can express this relationship as:

J = 3L

We are also given that John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which can be represented as:

"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cows as x and the number of chickens as 2x, as stated in the problem.

We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 60

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 20

Now that we have the number of cows, we can calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x

Substituting x = 20, we get:

8x = 8(20) = 160

Thus, the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm is 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we can calculate the total number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week and then subtract the number of balls he lost.

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 3 and a common difference of 1. The number of balls at the end of the fourth week can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where an is the number of balls at the end of the fourth week, a1 is the first term (3), n is the number of weeks (4), and d is the common difference (1).

an = 3 + (4 - 1)1
an = 3 + 3
an = 6

Since Josh lost 1 ball, the number of balls he has left is:

6 - 1 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can start by assigning variables to each animal's weight. Let's denote the weight of the pink frog as P, the blue beetle as B, the green toad as T, the yellow snake as S, and the red bird as R. We are given the following information:

1. P = B
2. P = T
3. P = S - 10
4. P = R + 20

We are also given that the container weighs 20 pounds.

We can use these equations to find the weight of each animal. From equation (1), we know that B = P. From equation (2), we know that T = P. From equation (3), we can express S in terms of P: S = P + 10. From equation (4), we can express R in terms of P: R = P - 20.

Now, we can find the total weight of the container and the animals by adding their weights: Total weight = P + B + T + S + R + 20 (container weight).

Substituting the expressions for B, T, S, and R in terms of P, we get:

Total weight = P + P + P + (P + 10) + (P - 20) + 20
Total weight = 4P + 10

We are given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, so P = 50. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Total weight = 4(50) + 10
Total weight = 200 + 10
Total weight = 210

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"

"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband, and then subtracting this value from the total number of cookies in the bag.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Her son eats 4 cookies per day for 5 days, resulting in a total of:
   4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

2. Her husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days, resulting in a total of:
   1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

3. The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is the sum of the individual totals:
   20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

4. Since the bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
   36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

"To calculate the total cost of the two shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can use the formula for percentage decrease:

Discounted Price = Original Price - (Discount Percentage * Original Price)

In this case, the original price of one shirt is $30, and the discount percentage is 40% or 0.4.

Discounted Price of one shirt = $30 - (0.4 * $30)
= $30 - $12
= $18

Since Davos bought two shirts, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the discounted price of one shirt by 2:

Total Cost = 2 * $18
= $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the two shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production.

The factory previously produced 10 tractors per day at a price of $100 per tractor, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they produce 5 silos per day at a price of $220 per silo, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final Answer: The final answer is 10%."
"To determine the total annual expenditure on dog care, we must first calculate the monthly expenditure and then multiply it by 12.

The monthly expenditure consists of the weekly cost of food, which is $25 per week, multiplied by 4 weeks, resulting in $100 per month. Additionally, there is a monthly cost of $20 for treats and $100 for medicine. Therefore, the total monthly expenditure is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Therefore, the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of plant pots required for the daisies and roses. Since April needs twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can express this as 2 * 30 = 60. Therefore, the total number of pots required is 30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90.

Next, we subtract the total number of pots required from the number April already had: 100 - 90 = 10.

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that she spent $11 on a sweater and gave $4 to her brother, the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

Let's denote the initial amount Andrea had as x. We can set up the equation:

x - $15 = $36

To solve for x, we can add $15 to both sides of the equation:

x = $36 + $15
x = $51

However, this is the total amount Andrea had initially. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the initial amount. Since we've already calculated the initial amount to be $51, we can directly subtract the total amount spent ($15) from this value:

Amount saved = $51 - $15
Amount saved = $36

Therefore, Andrea saved $36."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we can first calculate the total time he spent on other activities. 

Let's denote the total time John spent on vacation as x. We know that he spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. Additionally, he watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, totaling 6 hours. 

The total time spent on these activities can be expressed as: 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up the equation: 0.3x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing by taking 40% of the total time: 0.4x = 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

2. Her earnings from the second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75
3. Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's add her initial savings: $80 + $275 = $355

To find out how much she still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as x. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, its height can be represented as x + 5. The combined height of the two shortest trees is x + (x + 5) = 2x + 5.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shortest trees, so it can be expressed as 2(2x + 5). Simplifying this expression yields 4x + 10.

We are given that the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, so x = 6. Substituting this value into the expression for the tallest tree's height, we get 4(6) + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"

"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

Let's break down the costs:

- The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.
- The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.
- The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

To find the number of friends she can invite, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total amount of money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over 5 days, we can calculate the daily change she receives after purchasing the lollipops and then multiply it by the number of days.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Daily change: $5 (daily pocket money) - $1 (total cost of lollipops) = $4

To find the total amount saved over 5 days, we multiply the daily change by the number of days:
Total savings = $4 * 5 = $20

Therefore, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank over 5 days.

"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Billy had initially. Since he received $10 from his father and spent $2 on gumballs, the amount of money he had left is $10 - $2 = $8.

Next, we can calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount of money he spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5). This can be represented as:

Number of pounds = Total amount spent on candy / Cost per pound
= $2 / $1.5
= 1.33 pounds

Therefore, Billy bought 1.33 pounds of candy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"

The given information can be translated into the equation:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we obtain:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find:

S = 25

Therefore, the son's age is 25.

"To determine the number of days between services, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles. Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

Therefore, the train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we must first calculate the amount required for each type of bed. 

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, while the chihuahua bed necessitates 2 pounds. To find the average amount for a collie bed, we take the arithmetic mean of the two values: (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

With this information, we can calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed. For the 4 chihuahua beds, Mark will require 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing. For the 3 collie beds, he will need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

To find the total amount of stuffing required, we add the amounts needed for each type of bed: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate the time taken for this segment:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

However, John had to take a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. To account for this, we need to add the time taken for the detour. The detour distance is 10 miles, and the speed remains 70 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

Now, we can add the time taken for the detour to the time taken for the initial trip:

Total time taken to reach his friend's house = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours = 2.99 hours

The return trip is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we get:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we can add the time taken for the return trip to the total time taken to reach his friend's house:

Total time taken = 2.99 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

Therefore, the total time taken for the trip is 5.99 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can utilize the principle of set theory. Let's denote the total number of students as S, the number of absent girls as A_g, the number of absent boys as A_b, the number of present girls as P_g, and the number of present boys as P_b.

Given:
S = 96 (total students)
A_g = 5 (absent girls)
A_b = 4 (absent boys)

We are also given that the total number of girls is 43, so the number of present girls can be calculated as:
P_g = S - A_g - A_g (since the total number of girls is the sum of present and absent girls)
P_g = 96 - 5 - 5
P_g = 86

Now, we can find the number of present boys by subtracting the number of present girls from the total number of students:
P_b = S - P_g
P_b = 96 - 86
P_b = 10

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 10.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of boys as 'b' and the number of girls as 'g'. We are given that there are twice as many boys as girls, so we can express this relationship as:

b = 2g

We are also given that there are 6 girls in the park, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

b = 2(6)
b = 12

Now, to find the total number of kids, we can add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = b + g
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

Therefore, there are 18 kids in the park.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the points she needs on the third test as x. We know that the sum of the points from all three tests must be at least 42. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:

33 + x ≥ 42

Subtract 33 from both sides:

x ≥ 9

Since x represents the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can conclude that she must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a systematic approach by breaking it down into distinct components and utilizing algebraic expressions to represent the relationships between the variables.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. According to the problem, 3 customers were kicked out for this reason, so we can write:

x = 3

Next, we're told that a number equals four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This can be represented as:

y = 4x - 5

Since we know x = 3, we can substitute this value into the equation to find y:

y = 4(3) - 5
y = 12 - 5
y = 7

Therefore, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

We're also informed that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This can be expressed as:

z = 3y

Substituting the value of y we found earlier:

z = 3(7)
z = 21

So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for each reason:

Total = x + y + z
Total = 3 + 7 + 21
Total = 31

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out, the number of people kicked out for other reasons can be found by subtracting the total number of people kicked out for the other two reasons from the overall total:

Number of people kicked out for other reasons = Total - (x + y + z)
= 50 - (3 + 7 + 21)
= 50 - 31
= 19

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the number of points Sara had before scoring 8 as x. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara after scoring 8, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points after scoring 8 = 3(Sara's points after scoring 8) + 8

We know Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8, so we can set up the equation:

14 = 3(Sara's points after scoring 8) + 8

First, we need to find Sara's points after scoring 8. Let's denote Sara's points after scoring 8 as y. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:

14 = 3y + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides:

6 = 3y

Divide both sides by 3:

2 = y

So, Sara had 2 points after scoring 8. Now, we can find Sara's points before scoring 8 by subtracting 8 from 2:

Sara's points before scoring 8 = 2 - 8
Sara's points before scoring 8 = -6

However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-examine the equation:

14 = 3y + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides:

6 = 3y

Divide both sides by 3:

2 = y

Since Sara can't have a negative number of points, we need to re-evaluate the initial assumption. Let's re-examine the problem statement:

""Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8.""

This statement implies that Erin's points after scoring 8 is three times Sara's points after scoring 8. However, we know Erin scored 14 points after scoring 8. This means Erin's points after scoring 8 is not three times Sara's points after scoring 8.

Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Let's say Erin had x points before scoring 8. Then, Erin scored 8 points, making her total points x + 8. We know Erin's total points after scoring 8 is 14, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 14

Subtract 8 from both sides:

x = 6

So, Erin had 6 points before scoring 8.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we can break down the expenses into distinct components.

First, we need to determine the total cost of the picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching the logo. This can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24 per frame

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. Therefore, the total cost for the pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Additionally, we need to consider the cost of cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the senior gifts by adding the costs of the picture frames, pins, and cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final answer is: $1198"
"To determine the total cost of the DIY hand-painted wallpaper, we can calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original cost.

The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. A 20% discount is applied to this cost. 

The discount amount can be calculated as 20% of $400, which is equal to 0.20 * $400 = $80.

The total cost for the DIY hand-painted wallpaper is then obtained by subtracting the discount from the original cost:

Total cost = Original cost - Discount
= $400 - $80
= $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of shoes sold on each day: 
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, we must account for the six returned shoes. To find the total number of shoes sold, we add the number of shoes sold on each day and then subtract the number returned:

Total number of shoes sold = (14 + 28 + 14) - 6
= 56 - 6
= 50

Therefore, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we can calculate the total hours by adding the hours for each day.

Hallie's dance practice schedule can be represented as follows:

Tuesday: 1 hour
Thursday: 2 hours
Saturday: 2 hours (twice as long as Tuesday's night class)

Since Saturday's practice is twice as long as Tuesday's, we can express this relationship as a mathematical expression: Saturday = 2 * Tuesday. 

Now, we can calculate the total hours per week by adding the hours for each day:

Total hours per week = Tuesday + Thursday + Saturday
= 1 + 2 + 2 * 1
= 1 + 2 + 2
= 5

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we can use the concept of percentages and algebraic manipulation.

Let's denote the total number of pieces of equipment as x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x. Consequently, the number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000, and the amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x. Therefore, the amount spent on functioning pieces can be represented as:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = Total amount spent on all pieces - Amount spent on faulty pieces
= $400,000 - 0.4x

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = Amount spent on functioning pieces
0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Now, we can solve for x:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000
1x = 400,000
x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

Finally, we can calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000
= 240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can calculate the milk production from each half of the sheep and then sum the results.

Since Mary has 30 sheep, we can divide them into two equal groups of 15 sheep each. 

The milk production from the first half of the sheep is 15 * 1 kg = 15 kg.

The milk production from the second half of the sheep is 15 * 2 kg = 30 kg.

The total milk production is the sum of the milk from both halves: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"To determine the total number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding the children, which is a straightforward subtraction of 6 from the initial dozen (12).

12 - 6 = 6

Next, we multiply the remaining rolls by 8 to find the total number of pieces. This is a classic application of the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction.

6 × 8 = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of pupils who like blue, which is half of the total class size: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of remaining pupils: 40 - 20 = 20.

Then, we calculate the number of pupils who like green, which is one-fourth of the remaining pupils: 20 / 4 = 5.

Finally, we find the number of pupils who like yellow by subtracting the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils: 20 - 5 = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we can analyze the given information. 

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56. Given that the selling price is $4 per apple, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount received / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. Since she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we can calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks that need washing.

Let's denote the total number of socks that need washing as T, the number of pairs of socks washed as P, and the number of loose socks washed as L. We are given that T = 50, P = 10, and L = 15.

First, we need to find the total number of socks washed. Since each pair of socks has 2 socks, the number of socks washed from pairs is 2P. Adding the number of loose socks, the total number of socks washed is 2P + L.

Now, we can calculate the total number of socks washed: 2P + L = 2(10) + 15 = 20 + 15 = 35.

To find the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that need washing: T - (2P + L) = 50 - 35 = 15.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to find the total number of cookies Rachel had after receiving cookies from Janet. This can be calculated as the sum of the initial cookies and the cookies given by Janet:

Total cookies = Initial cookies + Cookies from Janet
Total cookies = 23 + 42
Total cookies = 65

Next, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by Rachel's brother from the total number of cookies:

Cookies left = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by brother
Cookies left = 65 - 44
Cookies left = 21

Therefore, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

Plugging in the values, we get:

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.008333^5)]/(1.008333^5 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.008333(1.0457)]/(1.0457 - 1)
M ≈ 3650[0.0079]/0.0457
M ≈ 3650(0.1733)
M ≈ 633.45

Rounding to the nearest dollar, Karan's monthly payment is approximately $633.

The final answer is $633."
"To determine the distance each individual hiked, we can apply the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time.

For Cho, the distance hiked can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 14 km/h × 8 h
Distance = 112 km

Similarly, for Chloe, the distance hiked can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 9 km/h × 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

Difference = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The correct answer is: 67"
"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we can calculate the sum of their individual silver and gold holdings.

Axel's silver holdings: 50
Axel's gold holdings: 80

Anna's silver holdings: 2 * Axel's silver holdings = 2 * 50 = 100
Anna's gold holdings: 80 + 40 = 120

Total silver holdings: Axel's silver + Anna's silver = 50 + 100 = 150
Total gold holdings: Axel's gold + Anna's gold = 80 + 120 = 200

Total number of pesos: Total silver holdings + Total gold holdings = 150 + 200 = 350

The total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together is 350."
"To determine the profit per hour that Millie will make from her lemonade stand, we need to calculate her total revenue and total cost.

First, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the number of cups of lemonade she sells by the price per cup. Since she sells 4 cups per hour and she sells all 36 cups, her total revenue is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Next, we calculate her total cost, which is given as $18.

Her profit is her revenue minus her cost: $36 - $18 = $18.

To find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand. Since she sells all 36 cups in 9 hours, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the original amount of land as x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can express this as:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

Therefore, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to calculate the total number of female members in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we can calculate this as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since half of the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. However, since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

The total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we can calculate the average of his 5 test scores using the formula for the arithmetic mean:

Average = (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)

Given scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74

First, we calculate the sum of the scores: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide the sum by the number of scores: 400 / 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

80"

"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote the number of messages to Ms. Thompson as x. Then, the number of messages to Mr. Yu is 1/3x. We are given that x = 66, so the number of messages to Mr. Yu is 1/3 * 66 = 22.

To find the total number of messages, we add the number of messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:

Total number of messages = x + 1/3x
= 66 + 22
= 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{88}$"
"To determine the amount David saves, we can compare the cost of purchasing 9 ride tickets to the cost of a ride bracelet. 

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18. 

A ride bracelet costs $30. 

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to purchase any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30. 

In this case, David saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for. This can be calculated using the formula:

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts

Given that Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and 12 gifts to make bows for, we can calculate the ribbon per gift as follows:

Ribbon per gift = 144 inches / 12 gifts
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is 12."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, which means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. We can represent this as a fraction: 5/6.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x, where x is a constant multiplier. Since the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can set up the equation:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:

Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference in the number of popsicles Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim receives a 20% discount for bundling. To calculate the discounted cost, we can use the formula:

Discounted Cost = Original Cost - (Discount Percentage * Original Cost)
Discounted Cost = $10 - (0.20 * $10)
Discounted Cost = $10 - $2
Discounted Cost = $8 per month

The total cost of the streaming services is the sum of the individual costs:
Total Streaming Cost = $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus)
Total Streaming Cost = $18 per month

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find the amount of money Tim saves, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
Savings = Cable Package Cost - Total Streaming Cost
Savings = $60 - $18
Savings = $42 per month

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable subscription.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the percentage of Carol's total work time spent editing, we need to first convert the time spent recording from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 minutes is equivalent to 1.5 hours.

The total work time can be calculated as the sum of the time spent writing, recording, and editing:

Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
= 4 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
= 7 hours

Now, we can find the percentage of time spent editing:

Percentage of time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) * 100
= (1.5 hours / 7 hours) * 100
= 21.43%

Therefore, Carol spent approximately 21.43% of her total work time editing."
"To determine the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we must first calculate the total capacity of the shelving system. Given that the shelving system consists of 6 rows and 6 columns, the total capacity can be calculated as follows:

Total capacity = Number of rows × Number of columns
Total capacity = 6 × 6
Total capacity = 36 books

Since Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books, we need to find double the capacity first. This can be calculated as:

Double capacity = 2 × Total capacity
Double capacity = 2 × 36
Double capacity = 72 books

To find the total number of books Wendy needs to carry, we add 20 more books to the double capacity:

Total books = Double capacity + 20
Total books = 72 + 20
Total books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task."
"To determine the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has, we can employ a straightforward approach by considering the initial number of cards she made, the number of cards she received, and the number of cards she gave away.

Initially, Erica made 20 cards and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. This results in a total of 20 + 2 * 15 = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

However, Erica also gave away 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards given away. To find the total number of cards Erica now has, we subtract the number of cards given away from the initial total: 50 - 29 = 21.

Therefore, Erica now has 21 Valentine's Day cards.

Final answer: 21"
"To determine the number of slices left, we can start by calculating the total number of slices given away. Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 12 = 4 slices. Similarly, she gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is equivalent to (1/4) * 12 = 3 slices.

The total number of slices given away is the sum of the slices given to Bill and Mark, which is 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Since Jenny initially had 12 slices, the number of slices left can be calculated as 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

However, Jenny also ate 2 slices, so the final number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use the concept of time value of money. Assuming Mark earns a constant daily income of $10, we can calculate the number of days required to accumulate the necessary funds.

Let's denote the number of days as 'd'. The total amount Mark needs to save is $300, and his daily income is $10. We can set up the equation:

10d = 300

To solve for 'd', we can divide both sides by 10:

d = 300 / 10
d = 30

Therefore, Mark needs 30 days to save for the bike.

Final answer: 30"
"To determine the total number of bugs, we can break down the problem into its constituent parts. 

First, we calculate the number of millipedes, which is 1/3 of the number of spiders. Given that there are 90 spiders, the number of millipedes can be calculated as:

Number of millipedes = (1/3) * 90
= 30

Next, we calculate the number of stink bugs, which is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Finally, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to obtain the total number of bugs.

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs)
= 90 + 30 + 48
= 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote Erica's age as E, Beth's age as B, and Alice's age as A. We are given that Erica is 30 years old, so E = 30.

We are also given that Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so B = E + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35.

Additionally, Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so A = B + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42.

The age difference between Alice and Erica can be calculated as A - E = 42 - 30 = 12.

Therefore, the age difference between Alice and Erica is 12 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total calories consumed, we can apply the fundamental principles of unit conversion and multiplication.

Given that a glass of milk contains 8 ounces and there are 3 calories per ounce, we can calculate the total calories consumed by multiplying the number of glasses by the ounces per glass and then by the calories per ounce.

Let's denote the number of glasses as 'g' and the calories per ounce as 'c'. We are given that g = 2 and c = 3.

Total calories = g * ounces per glass * calories per ounce
Total calories = 2 * 8 * 3
Total calories = 48

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we can employ the concept of total hours worked and hourly wage. Since the builder works 6 days a week and 4 weeks a month, the total number of working days in a month is 6 * 4 = 24 days. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of working days in a year is 24 * 12 = 288 days.

Given that the builder earns $50 per day, the total annual earnings can be calculated as:

Total Annual Earnings = Total Working Days * Daily Wage
= 288 days * $50/day
= $14,400

The final answer is: $14,400"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we can apply the concept of scaling a recipe. Since the normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk, and Mark is making a quadruple batch, we can multiply these quantities by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we can divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we can divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the energy saved by reducing the usage of the air conditioner from 8 hours to 3 hours a day, we can employ the concept of energy conservation and the unit conversion between watt-hours (Wh) and kilowatt-hours (kWh).

First, let's calculate the energy used in 8 hours a day:

Energy used in 8 hours a day = Power (P) × Time (t) = 900 W × 8 h = 7200 Wh

Next, we calculate the energy used in 3 hours a day:

Energy used in 3 hours a day = Power (P) × Time (t) = 900 W × 3 h = 2700 Wh

The energy saved per day is the difference between these two values:

Energy saved per day = Energy used in 8 hours a day - Energy used in 3 hours a day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert this value to kilowatt-hours (kWh), we divide by 1000:

Energy saved per day (in kWh) = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Now, we can calculate the total energy saved in 30 days:

Total energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day (in kWh) × Number of days = 4.5 kWh/day × 30 days = 135 kWh

Therefore, Mel will save 135 kWh of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the average number of stripes per zebra, we can employ the formula for mean, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, we have four zebras with the following number of stripes: 17, 17, 36, and 18.

First, we need to find the sum of the number of stripes: 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 = 88.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of zebras to find the average: 88 ÷ 4 = 22.

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed as follows:

Total number of sandwiches required = Total number of people / Number of people per sandwich
= 20 people / 4 people per sandwich
= 5 sandwiches

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:

Total meat required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds
Total cheese required = 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese using their respective prices:

Cost of meat = Total meat required * Price per pound of meat
= 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound
= $35.00

Cost of cheese = Total cheese required * Price per pound of cheese
= 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound
= $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is the sum of their individual costs:

Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese
= $35.00 + $15.00
= $50.00

$50.00"
"To determine the combined total of corns and cannolis, we must first establish the initial quantities of each. We are given that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has a total of 40 cannolis. This implies that the initial number of corns is 2 * 40 = 80.

However, we are also informed that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he initially had 40 cannolis, he must have bought 40 - 40 = 0 corns. This is an inconsistent scenario, as buying 40 fewer corns than cannolis is only possible if he initially had 0 cannolis. Therefore, we can disregard the information about buying 40 fewer corns.

Now, we know that Allan initially had 80 corns and bought 60 more cannolis. The total number of cannolis is now 40 + 60 = 100.

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is 80 (initial corns) + 100 (final cannolis) = 180.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of steps taken during the jog as 'x'. We know that Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend, resulting in a total of 6,000 steps before the jog. After the jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take, which means the total steps taken during the jog plus the remaining steps should equal 10,000.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

6,000 + x + 2,000 = 10,000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8,000 + x = 10,000

Subtracting 8,000 from both sides, we find:

x = 2,000

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

The final answer is: 2,000"
"To determine the time Toby will arrive at the airport, we must consider the time it takes him to finish reading the book and the time it takes to travel to the airport.

First, we calculate the time required to finish the book. Given that the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Toby's reading rate is 300 words per minute, so the time required to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to travel to the airport, which is 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time required for Toby to arrive at the airport is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Since Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book, he will arrive at the airport 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This results in a total of:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left, resulting in 30 employees remaining. The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is the sum of the amounts paid in May and June:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"
"To determine the amount of money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased.

The taffy costs 2 pounds at $3 each, so the total cost of the taffy is 2 × $3 = $6. Since the second pound is 1/2 off, it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $6 + $1.50 = $7.50.

The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

The 4 magnets cost 4 × $0.25 = $1.

The total cost of all the items is $7.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $10.

Since Sally started with $10 and spent $10, we can conclude that she has $0 left.

The final answer is: $0"
"To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

Next, we need to calculate the discount on the two packages. The discount is 20% of $1200, which can be calculated as 0.20 x $1200 = $240. 

The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted cost of the two packages. The total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. Since she consumes 2 cookies per night and aims to sustain herself for 30 days, the total number of cookies required can be calculated as follows:

Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Given that her recipe yields 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can then divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to obtain the number of dozens required:

Total dozens needed = Total cookies needed / 12
= 60 cookies / 12
= 5

Therefore, Shannon needs to prepare 5 dozens of cookies to meet her 30-day requirement.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can apply the concept of overlapping sets. Let's break down the problem into two distinct events: the candles exploding and the candles smelling like wet dog.

Given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can calculate the number of candles with this defect as follows:

Number of candles smelling like wet dog = 5% of 50,000 = 0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500 candles

However, not all candles smelling like wet dog explode. We are told that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. Therefore, the number of candles that explode can be calculated as:

Number of candles that explode = 1% of 50,000 = 0.01 x 50,000 = 500 candles

Since we want to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to find the intersection of these two sets. However, the problem does not provide a direct way to calculate this intersection. We can, however, use the fact that the number of candles that smell like wet dog is 2,500, and the number of candles that explode is 500.

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. However, in this case, it's more straightforward to recognize that the 500 candles that explode are a subset of the 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is equal to the number of candles that explode.

Final answer: $\boxed{500}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of each blouse. The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20.

The discount amount can be calculated as follows:

Discount = 30% of $20 = 0.30 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount:

Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining variables for the number of apples gathered from each type of tree. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples gathered from the average trees as z.

We are given that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30. We are also given that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2x = 2(30) = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Additionally, we know that Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, so y = 15. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3y = 3(15) = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 500

Substituting the values we know, we get:

30 + 15 + z = 500

Combine like terms:

45 + z = 500

Subtract 45 from both sides:

z = 455

Therefore, Joanne gathers 455 apples from the average trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{455}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.

We are given two pieces of information: the total number of heads (which is equivalent to the total number of animals) is 180, and the total number of bumps (which is equivalent to the total number of humps) is 304. Since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can set up the following system of equations:

c + d = 180  (Equation 1: Total number of heads)
2c + d = 304  (Equation 2: Total number of bumps)

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. If we multiply Equation 1 by -2, we get:

-2c - 2d = -360

Now, we can add this equation to Equation 2:

(-2c - 2d) + (2c + d) = -360 + 304
-2d + d = -56
-d = -56

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

d = 56

Now that we have found the value of d, we can substitute it into Equation 1 to find the value of c:

c + 56 = 180
c = 180 - 56
c = 124

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down his journey into distinct segments and calculate the total distance traveled in each segment.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day, resulting in a total distance of 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. This can be calculated as 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km.

On the next day, Tom did not travel, so we do not need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day, resulting in a total distance of 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

To find the total distance traveled during the entire two-week-long trip, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week: 1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can utilize the given information about the relative sizes of the lockers. We are told that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches in size. This allows us to calculate Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 4 × 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 × 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches in size."
"To determine the distance Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we can utilize the concept of vertical displacement. Since Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet and Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet, the vertical displacement (or the distance Oliver must climb) can be calculated as follows:

Δh = h2 - h1

where Δh is the vertical displacement, h2 is the final elevation (10,000 feet), and h1 is the initial elevation (3,000 feet).

Δh = 10,000 - 3,000
Δh = 7,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7,000}$"
"To determine the total capital Mr. Josue has now, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.
2. The first bank gave him $4000.
3. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is 2 * $4000 = $8000.

Now, we can add the initial capital to the total amount received from the two banks:

$5000 + $4000 = $9000
$9000 + $8000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

The final answer is: $17000"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and fractions.

Initially, we have 50 cats on the rock. Four boats arrive and each carry away 5 cats. This results in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 cats being removed from the rock. The remaining number of cats is 50 - 20 = 30.

Next, we need to find 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats. To do this, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which can be rewritten as (30 * 3) / 5. This simplifies to 90 / 5, resulting in 18 cats running after the mouse.

Finally, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats: 30 - 18 = 12.

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we can break down the subscription into three distinct periods based on the pricing structure.

The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, resulting in a total of 6 * $8 = $48.

The next 8 months are charged at the normal rate of $12 per month, resulting in a total of 8 * $12 = $96.

The final 8 months are charged at the increased rate of $14 per month, resulting in a total of 8 * $14 = $112.

To find the total cost of 2 years, we can sum the costs of these three periods: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

Therefore, the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service is $256."
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let x be the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

We know that Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans. Therefore, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)(x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

2(x + 6) = 18

Next, we can distribute the 2 to the terms inside the parentheses:

2x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 6

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $3, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 3 + 6
= 9

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans
= 9 - 3
= 6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total capacity of the vehicles, we can calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570.

The final answer is: $\boxed{570}$"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's denote the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder as B and the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder as H. We are given that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so we can express this as H = B + 10.

We also know that Lillian buys 3 store-bought feeders and builds 3 homemade feeders. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3B, and the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3H.

Since H = B + 10, we can substitute this expression into the equation for the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3H = 3(B + 10) = 3B + 30.

Now, we can add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 3B + (3B + 30) = 6B + 30.

We are given that each feeder attracts 20 birds, so we can set up the equation 6B + 30 = 20(3 + 3) to represent the total number of birds attracted to all feeders.

Simplifying the equation, we get 6B + 30 = 20(6) = 120.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 6B = 90.

Dividing both sides by 6, we get B = 15.

Now that we know the number of birds attracted to a store-bought feeder, we can find the number of birds attracted to a homemade feeder: H = B + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25.

Finally, we can find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day: 3B + 3H = 3(15) + 3(25) = 45 + 75 = 120.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 120 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: 120"
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we can break down the costs of each item and calculate the total.

The bagel costs $4, and the soup costs 25% more than the bagel. This can be expressed as:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (25% of Cost of bagel)
= $4 + (0.25 × $4)
= $4 + $1
= $5

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which can be represented as:

Cost of cake = (1/2) × Cost of bagel
= (1/2) × $4
= $2

Now, we can calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner by adding the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of Pokémon cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny had as x. Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling these cards is then 2/3 * $1.5 = $1.

We know that Kenny has $50 in spending cash, which is the amount he made from selling the cards. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2/3 * 1.5x = 50

To solve for x, we can first simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

2.5x = 50

Now, divide both sides by 2.5:

x = 50 / 2.5
x = 20

So, Kenny started with 20 cards."
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of hotdogs required for 40 guests to have two hotdogs each. This can be calculated as:

2 hotdogs/guest × 40 guests = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer initially prepared 36 hotdogs, we can determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog by subtracting the initial number of hotdogs from the total required:

80 hotdogs (required) - 36 hotdogs (prepared) = 44 hotdogs

However, since each guest initially received one hotdog, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is equivalent to the number of hotdogs that were not provided. Therefore, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is:

44 hotdogs / 1 hotdog/guest = 44 guests

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the number of letters in Indras' name. Given that her name has 6 letters, we can represent this as a constant value: 6.

Next, we are told that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. To find half of 6, we can use the formula for half of a number: (6 ÷ 2) = 3.

Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, we can represent this as an expression: 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can find the total number of letters in both names by adding the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7): 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order, we can employ the concept of a discount. Given that the items are 20% off, we can use the formula for calculating the discount amount and then subtract it from the total cost.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   Discount amount = 20% of $165.00
   Discount amount = 0.20 * $165.00
   Discount amount = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   Total cost after discount = Total cost - Discount amount
   Total cost after discount = $165.00 - $33.00
   Total cost after discount = $132.00

Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order after the 20% discount is $132.00."
"To determine the amount of money Dora needs to purchase the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball, we can calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, for a total of $18.

To find the amount she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost: $19 - $18 = $1.

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information provided step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Arthur slew = (3/4) * 100
= 75

Next, Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Walter slew = 2 * 75
= 150

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This can be expressed as:

Number of dragons Prince Bruce slew = (1/5) * 150
= 30

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can calculate 1/4 of the total amount of gasoline in gallons and then convert it to pints.

Given that 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15/5 = 3 gallons. 

Now, we can find 1/4 of 3 gallons: 

1/4 * 3 gallons = 3/4 gallon

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3/4 gallon to pints:

(3/4) * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of candy bars George purchased, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. We know that George spent a total of $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. He spent 120 cents on chips, leaving him with 500 - 120 = 380 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can express this as 1% of 500 cents, which is 5 cents. Therefore, the amount he spent on candy bars is 380 - 5 = 375 cents.

Given that each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can set up the equation 75x = 375 to represent the total amount spent on candy bars. Solving for 'x', we get x = 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can employ a simple division operation. 

Let's denote the total number of lollipops as T, the number of lollipops Ray kept as R, and the number of friends as F. We are given T = 25 and R = 5. We want to find the number of lollipops each friend received, which is equal to the total number of lollipops minus the number Ray kept, divided by the number of friends.

Lollipops per friend = (T - R) / F
= (25 - 5) / 4
= 20 / 4
= 5

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the weight of the remaining cake, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Since Rory and her mom each have a piece, the total weight of the pieces they had is equal to the weight of one piece. 

Let's denote the weight of one piece as x. Since there are 8 pieces in total, we can set up the equation:

8x = 20

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 20/8
x = 2.5

Now that we know the weight of one piece, we can find the weight of the remaining cake by subtracting the weight of the two pieces from the total weight:

Weight of the remaining cake = Total weight - Weight of the two pieces
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2x
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 2(2.5)
Weight of the remaining cake = 20 - 5
Weight of the remaining cake = 15

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To determine the number of oranges each person will receive, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and then divide it by the total number of people.

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges: 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges.

Next, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, which is 8 (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

Total oranges ÷ Total people = 56 ÷ 8

To perform this division, we can use the following calculation:

56 ÷ 8 = 7

Therefore, each person will receive 7 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we must first calculate the total cost of the ingredients. The cost of the onions is 2 pounds * $2.00 per pound, and the cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box. 

The total cost of the ingredients is the sum of the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock: $2(2) + $2(2) = $4 + $4 = $8.

Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 2 * 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8 + $8 = $16.

To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $16 ÷ 6.

The cost per serving is $16 ÷ 6 = $2.67.

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to consider the time it takes for both individuals to reach the theater. 

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater as B. We are given that W = 4 minutes. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, we can express this relationship as B = 4W.

Now, we want Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. This means that the time difference between their arrival times is 5 minutes. We can express this as B = W - 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation B = W - 5, we get 4W = W - 5. Solving for W is not necessary, as we are interested in the time difference. We can rearrange the equation to find the time difference: B - W = 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get 4W - W = 5, which simplifies to 3W = 5. However, this is not the correct approach. We should instead find the time difference between their departure times.

Since B = 4W, we can express Bernadette's departure time as B = W - 5. To find the time difference, we need to find the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. We know that B = 4W, and W = 4 minutes. However, we cannot directly substitute W into the equation B = 4W to find the time difference. Instead, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater by dividing the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater by 4: B = W / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1 minute.

Now that we know Bernadette's driving time, we can find the time difference between their departure times: B - W = 1 - 4 = -3 minutes. However, this is the time difference in the opposite direction. Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to find the time difference in the correct direction. The correct time difference is 4 - 1 = 3 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we must first convert the length from yards to feet, as the standard unit of measurement for area is square feet. Given that 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Next, we can utilize the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = L * W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width. We are provided with the area, which is 360 square feet, and the length, which we have determined to be 9 feet. By substituting these values into the formula, we can solve for the width:

360 = 9 * W

Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we obtain:

W = 360 / 9
W = 40 feet

Now that we have determined the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula P = 2 * (L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.

P = 2 * (9 + 40)
P = 2 * 49
P = 98 feet

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 98 feet.

Final answer: 98"
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we can calculate the total number of beads each one has.

Elizabeth purchased 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). Therefore, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth purchased 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). Thus, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters can be calculated as follows: 140 (Margareth's beads) - 60 (Elizabeth's beads) = 80 beads.

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we can break down the problem into two distinct components: the temperature change due to baking and the cooling effect.

First, let's calculate the temperature change due to baking. Since the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour, and Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the total temperature increase can be calculated as:

ΔT_baking = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

Next, we need to consider the cooling effect. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the total cooling effect can be calculated as:

ΔT_cooling = -2 degrees/10 minutes * 30 minutes = -6 degrees

Now, we can calculate the final temperature by adding the initial temperature to the temperature change due to baking and subtracting the cooling effect:

T_final = T_initial + ΔT_baking - ΔT_cooling
= 40 degrees + 15 degrees - 6 degrees
= 49 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of Marcus's house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' time for the run, we can start by calculating the time difference between Jon and James for each segment of the triathlon.

First, we calculate James' time for the swim, which is 10% faster than Jon's time. This can be expressed as:

James' swim time = Jon's swim time - (10% of Jon's swim time)
= 40 minutes - (0.1 * 40 minutes)
= 40 minutes - 4 minutes
= 36 minutes

Next, we calculate James' time for the bike ride, which is 5 minutes longer than Jon's time. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so:

James' bike time = Jon's bike time + 5 minutes
= 80 minutes + 5 minutes
= 85 minutes

Now, we know that Jon won by 10 minutes, and his run time is 50 minutes. Therefore, James' run time must be:

James' run time = Jon's run time + 10 minutes
= 50 minutes + 10 minutes
= 60 minutes

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we can utilize a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

First, we convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes, as the other lengths are provided in minutes. 

Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, its length can be calculated as 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.

Given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can express this relationship as an equation: 

Length of Movie A = (1/4) * Length of Movie B

Substituting the length of Movie B into the equation, we get:

Length of Movie A = (1/4) * 80
= 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total cost of the hay, we can calculate the total amount of hay consumed and then multiply it by the cost per bail.

First, we need to find the total distance the horse runs. Given that the horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (mph) for 0.5 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = speed * time
Distance = 32 mph * 0.5 hours
Distance = 16 miles

Since the horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total amount of hay consumed is:

Total hay = 16 miles * 1/2 bail/mile
Total hay = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:

Cost = Total hay * cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3/bail
Cost = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, so his total amount of money is:

Total money = 6 * $5
Total money = $30

To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money:

Change = Total money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24
Change = $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the number of trays Rozanne can put out, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she has and then divide that by the number of eggs required per glass.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs: 4 dozen eggs is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, we get 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Since each glass requires 5 eggs, we can calculate the number of glasses as 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses.

Now, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find the number of trays: 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray = 2 trays.

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the current lead of Joey in the Scrabble game, we need to calculate the difference in points between his score and Marcy's score after their respective turns.

The difference in points between Joey's and Marcy's scores can be calculated as follows:

Joey's lead = Joey's score - Marcy's score
= 240 - 235
= 5

Therefore, Joey is currently leading by 5 points.

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we can employ a straightforward approach by first determining the total revenue generated from the sale of the sneakers. The salesman initially sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, resulting in a revenue of $340. The remaining 31 sneakers were sold at $25 each, yielding an additional revenue of $775. 

Total revenue = Revenue from selling 17 sneakers + Revenue from selling 31 sneakers
Total revenue = $340 + $775
Total revenue = $1115

The total cost of the sneakers is given as $576. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To determine the total number of colors Beatrice bought, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's break down the information provided:

We know that six packets had 8 colors each, and four packets had 16 colors each. We can represent this information using a weighted average formula:

Total Colors = (Number of packets with 8 colors * Colors per packet) + (Number of packets with 16 colors * Colors per packet)

Total Colors = (6 * 8) + (4 * 16)
Total Colors = 48 + 64
Total Colors = 112

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

The final answer is: $\boxed{112}$"
"To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the regular price of the popcorn as x.

The cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, and the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $18. Since the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

We know that the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $12, so we can set up the equation:

12 = 17 - x + 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

12 = 20 - x

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get:

-8 = -x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can utilize the concept of unitary pricing. Initially, the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900. This implies a cost per balloon of $900 / 20 = $45. 

Following the price increase, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. To find the total cost of filling 170 balloons, we can multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11,050.

The final answer is $11,050."
"To determine the average speed of the car during the trip, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

Let's break down the trip into two segments:

1. The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.
2. The car then travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, covering a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles.

The total distance traveled is the sum of these two distances: 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

The total time taken is the sum of the times for each segment: 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 150 miles / 3 hours
= 50 mph

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"To determine the total value of Jenna's jewels, we can calculate the value of the sapphires she has left and the value of the rubies she received.

Jenna initially has 8 sapphires, but she trades 3 sapphires. Therefore, she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.

The value of the sapphires she has left can be calculated as 5 * $800 = $4000.

Jenna receives 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200. The total value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400.

The total value of her jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies, which is $4000 + $2400 = $6400.

"To determine the total cost of potting soil, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for the raised beds and then divide it by the capacity of each bag.

Given that each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, the volume of one bed can be calculated as:

Volume = length x width x height = 8 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

Total Volume = 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

Number of bags = Total Volume / 2 cubic feet/bag = 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

The cost of each bag is $12, so the total cost will be:

Total Cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag = 160 bags x $12/bag = $1920

Therefore, the total cost of potting soil for Bob's vegetable garden will be $1920.

The final answer is: $1920"
"To determine the total number of cards, we can break down the problem into three components: red cards, green cards, and yellow cards.

First, we know that there are 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. We can express this as:

Number of green cards = 15 + 0.6 * 15
= 15 + 9
= 24

Next, we are told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
= 39

Now, we can calculate the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78.

Final answer: 78"
"To determine the number of fairies remaining, we can employ a step-by-step approach. Initially, Katelyn observed 50 fairies. 

First, we need to account for the fairies that flew in from the east. Since the problem states that the number of fairies that flew in from the east is half the initial number, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of fairies that flew in from the east = 50 / 2 = 25

Now, we can find the total number of fairies after the new arrivals:

Total number of fairies = Initial number of fairies + Number of fairies that flew in from the east
= 50 + 25
= 75

Next, we need to subtract the fairies that flew away. The problem states that 30 fairies flew away 10 minutes later. Therefore, the remaining number of fairies can be calculated as follows:

Remaining number of fairies = Total number of fairies - Number of fairies that flew away
= 75 - 30
= 45

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we can use the concept of proportions. Let's denote the total number of puppies as T and the number of spotted puppies as S. We are given that Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and 3 of them are spotted, while Brandon's dog has 12 puppies and 4 of them are spotted.

First, we need to find the total number of puppies, which is the sum of the puppies from both dogs: T = 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we can find the total number of spotted puppies: S = 3 + 4 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of spotted puppies by dividing the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100:

(S / T) * 100 = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35\%}$"
"To determine the number of trips required to transport the feed, we must first calculate the total weight of the feed. This can be achieved by summing the weights of each item.

The total weight of the feed is given by the expression: 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 42 bales of hay * 75 pounds/bale + 20 sacks of oats * 65 pounds/sack.

Let's calculate the total weight:

Total weight = 2 + 48 + (42 * 75) + (20 * 65)
= 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
= 4400 pounds

Now, we can divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck to find the number of trips required. The capacity of the truck is 2250 pounds.

Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity of the truck
= 4400 / 2250
= 1.96

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, we must round up to the nearest whole number to ensure all the feed is transported. Therefore, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Grayson's monthly earnings from recycling, we can calculate her weekly earnings and then multiply it by 4.

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. Her earnings from aluminum cans per week can be calculated as 3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week.

Similarly, she earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. Her earnings from plastic bottles per week can be calculated as 5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week.

The total earnings per week is the sum of her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles, which is 6 cents/week + 15 cents/week = 21 cents/week.

To find her monthly earnings, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4: 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

The final answer is 84."
"To determine the number of plants Shondra has, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of plants Frederick has as F, Toni has as T, and Shondra has as S.

Given that Frederick has 10 plants, we can express the relationship between the number of plants each person has as follows:

F = 10

We are also given that Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. This can be represented as:

T = F + 0.6F
T = 1.6F

Substituting the value of F into the equation, we get:

T = 1.6(10)
T = 16

Now that we know Toni has 16 plants, we can find the number of plants Shondra has by subtracting 7 from Toni's total:

S = T - 7
S = 16 - 7
S = 9

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide that by the number of cards each student received.

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards in each deck, and 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box. The total number of basketball cards is 6 * 25 = 150, and the total number of baseball cards is 5 * 40 = 200. Therefore, the total number of cards is 150 + 200 = 350.

Since Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, the remaining cards are 350 - 50 = 300. Each student received 10 cards, so the number of students can be found by dividing the remaining cards by 10: 300 / 10 = 30.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the difference in the amount paid by Becky and Kelly, we can calculate their individual costs and then find the difference.

Becky's cost can be calculated as the product of the number of apples and the price per apple, minus the discount. The number of apples is 20, and the price per apple is $0.45. The discount is $1. Therefore, Becky's cost is:

20 * 0.45 - 1 = 9 - 1 = $8

Kelly's cost can be calculated similarly. The number of apples is also 20, and the price per apple is $0.50. The discount is 10% of the total cost, which is 0.10 * 20 * 0.50 = $2. Therefore, Kelly's cost is:

20 * 0.50 - 2 = 10 - 2 = $8

The difference in their costs is $8 - $8 = $0.

The final answer is: $0"
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we can break down the calculation into components and apply the principles of arithmetic.

Let's denote the number of sheets, comforters, pillowcases, and towels per room as S, C, P, and T, respectively. We are given the following relationships:

S = 2
C = S
P = 2S
T = 2P

We can express the total number of pieces per room as the sum of these components:

Total pieces per room = S + C + P + T
= 2 + 2 + 2(2) + 2(2(2))
= 2 + 2 + 4 + 8
= 16

Now, we can multiply the total number of pieces per room by the number of rooms to find the overall total:

Total pieces in 80 rooms = 16 * 80
= 16 * 80
= 1280

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1280."
"To determine the total number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, Fireman Frank has 200 shoes. On Monday, he acquires 5 pairs, which equates to 10 individual shoes (since each pair consists of 2 shoes). This brings the total to 200 + 10 = 210 shoes. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, adding 30 shoes to his collection, resulting in 210 + 30 = 240 shoes. Finally, on Friday, he acquires 30 more pairs, increasing his total to 240 + 30 = 270 shoes. However, on Saturday, he disposes of 180 shoes, leaving him with 270 - 180 = 90 shoes.

"To determine the number of pencils left, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of pencils initially: 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in 2 months: 1/5 of 300 pencils = (1/5) * 300 = 60 pencils.

Then, we subtract the used pencils from the initial total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

Finally, we calculate 1/3 of the remaining pencils to find the pencils left at the end of the year: (1/3) * 240 = 80 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left is 80."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as x. According to the given conditions, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be represented by the equation:

(1/2)x + 2 = 5

To isolate x, we can start by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

(1/2)x = 5 - 2
(1/2)x = 3

Next, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 3 * 2
x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"To determine the number of books each child received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that Sarah spent $300 on books, with each book priced at $15, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

Total Cost = $300
Book Price = $15

Total Books = Total Cost ÷ Book Price
Total Books = $300 ÷ $15
Total Books = 20

Since Sarah distributed the books equally among her 4 children, we can divide the total number of books by 4 to find the number of books each child received:

Number of Books per Child = Total Books ÷ 4
Number of Books per Child = 20 ÷ 4
Number of Books per Child = 5

Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of kids in Gina's class who aren't allergic to anything, we can employ the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of kids in the class as N, the number of kids allergic to dairy as D, the number of kids allergic to peanuts as P, and the number of kids allergic to both as B. We're given that N = 32, D = 9, and P = 6, with B = 3.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance can be calculated as:

D + P - B = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the total number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:

N - (D + P - B) = 32 - 12 = 20

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we can utilize the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that the employees were divided into 3 groups, each consisting of 200 employees, we can calculate the total number of employees by multiplying the number of groups by the number of employees in each group.

Total number of employees = Number of groups × Number of employees in each group
Total number of employees = 3 × 200
Total number of employees = 600

In addition to the employees, there are 7 tour guides accompanying the groups. To find the total number of people going on the tour, we simply add the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

Total number of people going on the tour = Total number of employees + Number of tour guides
Total number of people going on the tour = 600 + 7
Total number of people going on the tour = 607

The final answer is: $\boxed{607}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we can break down the expenses into two components: the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets can be calculated as 2 x $5000, since there are two people traveling. This results in a total cost of $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we can calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.20 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of paint tubes Jasper has, we can analyze the information provided. 

Let's denote the number of blue paint tubes Ben has as B and the number of yellow paint tubes Ben has as Y. We are given that B = 4 and Y = 3. 

Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, the number of blue paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as B/2. 

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has can be calculated as 3Y.

The total number of paint tubes Jasper has is the sum of the blue and yellow paint tubes, which can be expressed as B/2 + 3Y.

Substituting the given values, we get: B/2 + 3Y = 4/2 + 3(3) = 2 + 9 = 11.

"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a ratio:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 * Weight of 1959 penny

Since the weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48
= 36 grains

Now, we can find the combined weight of the two pennies by adding their individual weights:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate the difference in their song capacities. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we can express this as a ratio.

Let's denote the number of songs Gabriel has as G and the number of songs Luri has as L. We know that L = 3G. 

We also know that the maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

G + L ≤ 100

Substituting L = 3G into the equation, we get:

G + 3G ≤ 100

Combine like terms:

4G ≤ 100

Divide both sides by 4:

G ≤ 25

Since Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the remaining capacity of his player:

Remaining capacity = 100 - 20 = 80

Now, we can find the remaining capacity of Luri's player:

Remaining capacity of Luri's player = 100 - 60 = 40

The difference in the number of songs they can add is the difference between their remaining capacities:

Difference = 80 - 40 = 40

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we can employ the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges they picked, we can express this as a fraction of the total number of oranges. 

Let's denote the total number of oranges as x. Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, the amount of money he gave up can be calculated as:

(2/5) * x * $10

We are given that the total number of oranges picked is 60. Therefore, we can substitute x = 60 into the equation:

(2/5) * 60 * $10

To simplify the expression, we can first calculate the product of 2/5 and 60:

(2/5) * 60 = (2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

"To determine the total hours James runs per week, we can employ the fundamental principles of unit conversion. Given that James runs 12 miles per day and 5 days a week, we can calculate the total miles run per week as follows:

Total miles per week = miles per day * days per week
Total miles per week = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week
Total miles per week = 60 miles/week

Next, we can convert the total miles per week to hours by utilizing the conversion factor of miles per hour. We know that James runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, we can calculate the total hours per week as follows:

Total hours per week = total miles per week / miles per hour
Total hours per week = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
Total hours per week = 6 hours/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in a day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, the daily consumption per horse is 5 * 2 = 10 pounds. With four horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

To find the total amount of oats needed for five days, we multiply the daily consumption by 5: 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Now, we need to determine how many 50-pound bags are required to meet this demand. We can do this by dividing the total amount of oats needed by the weight of a single bag: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of girl Pomeranians, we can apply the concept of proportions. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate the number of girl Pomeranians as follows:

Let's denote the total number of puppies as P and the number of Pomeranians as P'. We know that P' = (2/3)P. Since one-third of the Pomeranians are girls, the number of girl Pomeranians can be represented as (1/3)P'.

Substituting P' = (2/3)P into the expression for the number of girl Pomeranians, we get:

Number of girl Pomeranians = (1/3) * (2/3)P
= (2/9)P

Given that P = 27, we can substitute this value into the expression:

Number of girl Pomeranians = (2/9) * 27

"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we can break it down into individual layers and sum their heights.

Let's denote the average height of the 9 girls who are 64"" tall as 'a'. The height of the bottom layer, consisting of 4 girls, is then 4a. The next layer, with 3 girls standing on top of the 4, has a height of 3a. The layer above that, with 2 girls standing on top of the 3, has a height of 2a. The shortest girl, who is 60"" tall, is at the top of the pyramid.

The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the layers: 4a + 3a + 2a + 60"". 

Since we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, we can express 'a' as 64 inches. 

Now, we can substitute 'a' into the equation: 
4(64) + 3(64) + 2(64) + 60"" = 256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60""

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of guests.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $200 plus an additional $5 per guest for food, which can be represented as 200 + 5x. The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest, which can be represented as 25x.

To find the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we can set up the equation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtracting 5x from both sides yields:

200 = 20x

Dividing both sides by 20 results in:

x = 10

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found. Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x, the number David found as y, and the number Lily found as z.

We are given that Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can express this as:

z = y + 7

We are also given that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this as:

y = x/2

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 43

Substituting the expressions for y and z in terms of x, we get:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects David found:

y = x/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

z = y + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as 'x'. Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, the total cost of these packs is 2x.

We are given that she paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, which is $1. The total amount she spent on grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3.

The total amount she spent on all the gum is $7. Therefore, the total cost of the strawberry gum packs can be represented as 2x = $7 - $3.

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide both sides of the equation by 2, yielding x = $4 / 2 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the most cost-effective option for Frederick to purchase lumber, we can calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber and compare them.

The cost per stick for 2 x 4 lumber is given by:

Cost per stick = $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick

The cost per stick for 2 x 8 lumber is given by:

Cost per stick = $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

Since $0.015 per stick is less than $0.02 per stick, Frederick should prioritize purchasing 2 x 8 lumber to minimize his costs.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of sticks he can make with $24:

Number of 2 x 8 lumber = $24 / $6 = 4

Total sticks = 4 x 400 = 1600 sticks

Therefore, Frederick can make a maximum of 1600 popsicle sticks with the given budget.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1600}$"
"To determine the total cost of snowshoes for Mario's sled dogs, we can apply the principle of multiplication. Since each dog requires a pair of snowshoes, and the cost of each pair is $12.00, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00."
"To determine the amount Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass, we can calculate the total cost of her bus trips for a week and subtract the cost of the pass.

Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week, resulting in a total of 10 bus trips per week. Given that each bus trip costs $2.20, the total weekly cost can be calculated as:

Total weekly cost = Number of trips per week x Cost per trip
Total weekly cost = 10 trips/week x $2.20/trip
Total weekly cost = $22.00/week

If Janet purchases a weekly bus pass for $20, her savings can be calculated as:

Savings = Total weekly cost - Cost of pass
Savings = $22.00/week - $20.00
Savings = $2.00/week

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 per week by purchasing a weekly bus pass.

The final answer is: $2."
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm and in the zoo, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of cows on the farm as F and the number of sheep on the farm as S, and the number of cows and sheep in the zoo as Z and W, respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. F = 30 (number of cows on the farm)
2. Z = 2F (the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm)
3. S = 0.5Z (the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo)
4. W = 20 (number of sheep in the zoo)

We can substitute the value of F into equation (2) to find Z: Z = 2(30) = 60.

Next, we can substitute the value of Z into equation (3) to find S: S = 0.5(60) = 30.

Now, we can find the total number of animals by adding the number of cows and sheep from both the farm and the zoo: Total animals = F + Z + S + W = 30 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"

"To determine the cost of the house, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the cost of the house as 'h' and the cost of the lot as 'l'. We are given that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can express this relationship as:

h = 3l

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

h + l = 120,000

Substituting h = 3l into the second equation, we get:

3l + l = 120,000
4l = 120,000

Now, we can solve for l by dividing both sides by 4:

l = 120,000 / 4
l = 30,000

Now that we have found the cost of the lot, we can determine the cost of the house by substituting l into the equation h = 3l:

h = 3(30,000)
h = 90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to calculate the remaining amount after he gives his sister half of the total money and then subtract the amount he spends on dinner.

First, we find the total amount of money Ali has: 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills. This can be calculated as:

Total money = (4 x $10) + (6 x $20)
Total money = $40 + $120
Total money = $160

Since Ali gives his sister half of the total money, we calculate the amount given as:

Amount given to sister = Total money / 2
Amount given to sister = $160 / 2
Amount given to sister = $80

The remaining amount of money Ali has is:

Remaining money = Total money - Amount given to sister
Remaining money = $160 - $80
Remaining money = $80

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. To find the amount spent on dinner, we calculate:

Amount spent on dinner = (3/5) x Remaining money
Amount spent on dinner = (3/5) x $80
Amount spent on dinner = $48

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

Remaining money after dinner = Remaining money - Amount spent on dinner
Remaining money after dinner = $80 - $48

"To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to calculate her original and new weekly consumption, then find the difference between the two.

Ada's original daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. To find her original weekly consumption, we multiply this value by 7:

12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, her original weekly bill is:

84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $126

Ada plans to add a device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. To find her new daily consumption, we add this value to her original consumption:

12 kilowatts/hour + 2 kilowatts/hour = 14 kilowatts/hour

Her new weekly consumption is:

14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, her new weekly bill is:

"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can apply the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of workers and the time required to complete a task. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as follows:

Time = (Total work) / (Number of workers)

Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, the total work required to paint a whole house is 2 times the work done in 5 days. Therefore, the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house is:

Time = (2 * 5 days) / 1 person = 10 days

Now, we can apply the inverse proportionality concept to find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house:

Time = (Total work) / (Number of workers)
= (10 days) / 5 people
= 2 days

Therefore, it will take 5 people 2 days to paint a whole house.

"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of sofas as S and the number of chairs as C.

We are given that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so we can express this as S = C - 2. We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which can be represented as C = 3S.

We can substitute the expression for S from the first equation into the second equation to solve for C. Substituting S = C - 2 into C = 3S, we get C = 3(C - 2).

Expanding the equation, we get C = 3C - 6. Rearranging the terms, we get 2C = 6, and solving for C, we find C = 3.

Now that we have the value of C, we can find the value of S by substituting C into the equation S = C - 2. This gives us S = 3 - 2, so S = 1.

The total number of sofas and chairs is the sum of S and C, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

"To determine the number of additional CDs Tom could have purchased if he had not bought the headphone set, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the CD and the remaining amount after subtracting the cost of the headphone set. 

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Remaining amount = Total amount paid - Cost of the headphone set
Remaining amount = $48 - $44
Remaining amount = $4

Now, we can calculate the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining amount by dividing the remaining amount by the cost of one CD.

Number of additional CDs = Remaining amount ÷ Cost of one CD
Number of additional CDs = $4 ÷ $4
Number of additional CDs = 1

Therefore, Tom could have bought 1 additional CD if he had not purchased the headphone set.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information and then solve for the unknown age difference.

Let's denote James' current age as J and his cousin's current age as C. We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can write an equation:

J + 5 = 27

Solving for J, we get:

J = 22

We are also given that in 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. We can write another equation:

C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 47

Now that we have the current ages of James and his cousin, we can find the age difference:

Age difference = C - J

C + 2M + P = 2,400

We also know that the cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer, which can be represented as:

P = C - 400

Substituting the expression for P into the first equation, we get:

C + 2M + (C - 400) = 2,400

Combine like terms:

2C + 2M - 400 = 2,400

Add 400 to both sides:

2C + 2M = 2,800

Divide both sides by 2:

C + M = 1,400

Now, we are given that the cost of the computer is $1,100. We can substitute this value into the equation:

1,100 + M = 1,400

Subtract 1,100 from both sides:

M = 300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300.

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we can calculate the thickness of each book and add them together.

Let's denote the thickness of the first book as x. The second book is 50 mm thick. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so its thickness can be represented as x - 5. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so its thickness can be represented as 2x.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total thickness of the four books:

x + 50 + (x - 5) + 2x = total thickness

Combine like terms:

4x + 45 = total thickness

To find the total thickness, we need to know the value of x. However, since we are given the thickness of the first book as 31 mm, we can substitute this value into the equation:

4(31) + 45 = total thickness
124 + 45 = total thickness
169 = total thickness

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is 169 mm."

"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month as x. Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x.

The total savings for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month, we can calculate the amount he needs to save in the second half. Since the second half is twice as much, we have:

Amount saved in the second half = 2x = 2 * 375 = $750

To find the daily savings for the second half, we divide the total savings for the second half by the number of days in the second half of the month (15):

Daily savings in the second half = $750 / 15

Daily savings in the second half = $50

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"
"To determine the change Verna received, we must first calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased. 

The cost of apples can be calculated as 3 * $1.50 = $4.50. 
The cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00. 
The cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50. 

The total cost of the fruit is the sum of these individual costs: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received can be calculated as $20 - $13.00 = $7.00.

The final answer is: $7.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can calculate their individual earnings and then find the difference.

Jairus earns $0.8 per task, so his total earnings for 20 tasks can be calculated as:

$0.8 per task × 20 tasks = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 per task, so her total earnings for 20 tasks can be calculated as:

$0.5 per task × 20 tasks = $10

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jenny's earnings from Jairus' earnings:

$16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of money Brad receives as x. Since Jeff receives four times as much as Brad, Jeff's share can be expressed as 4x.

The total amount of money, 100 dollars, is the sum of the amounts received by Jeff and Brad. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 20

Since Jeff's share is four times Brad's share, Jeff's amount can be calculated as 4x, which is 4(20) = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we can utilize the concept of total distance traveled, which is the product of the daily round-trip distance and the number of working days.

Given that Jeff's workplace is 3 miles away, the daily round-trip distance is 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles. Since he works 5 days a week, the total miles walked can be calculated as:

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we can break down the process into distinct steps. 

First, we calculate the number of letters in the initial two complete iterations of the alphabet: 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. 

Next, we consider the additional 13 letters written, which represent half of the alphabet. 

Finally, we add the total number of letters written in the initial two iterations to the 13 letters written in the subsequent iteration: 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters written by Elise is 65.

Final answer: $\boxed{65}$"
"This problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the number of families notified in each round is three times the number of families notified in the previous round. The first term (a) is 3, and the common ratio (r) is 3.

The number of families notified in the nth round can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression: an = a * r^(n-1).

To find the total number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to calculate the sum of the first four terms of the geometric progression.

Let's calculate the number of families notified in each round:

Round 1: a = 3
Round 2: a * r = 3 * 3 = 9
Round 3: a * r^2 = 3 * 3^2 = 27
Round 4: a * r^3 = 3 * 3^3 = 81

The total number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can utilize the concept of linear decline. Given that Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote Mark's initial weight as 'x'. The equation representing his weight loss over the 3 months can be expressed as:

x - 10 - 10 - 10 = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 30 = 70

Adding 30 to both sides of the equation yields:

x = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as 'x'. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 2 = 5 * 80.

Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 = 400.

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 398.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{398}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to purchase, we can apply the concept of a discount to the total cost of the items. The total cost of the items before the discount is calculated as follows:

The cost of 5 notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

To apply the 10% discount, we can use the formula:

Discount amount = (Total cost * Discount percentage) / 100
Discount amount = ($30 * 0.10) / 1
Discount amount = $3

Total cost after discount = Total cost - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3
Total cost after discount = $27

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy.

The final answer is: $27"
"To calculate the total cost of Carly's order, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3.

Then, we determine the total cost of the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10.

Now, we add the costs of all items together to find the total cost: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

To find the change Carly receives, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill: $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly gets $17 in change.

17"
"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we can break down the problem into two parts: the commission for sales up to $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

The commission for sales up to $1000 can be calculated using the formula: Commission = (Sales Amount * Commission Rate) / 100. In this case, the commission for sales up to $1000 is:

Commission = ($1000 * 30%) / 100
= ($1000 * 0.3) / 100
= $300

For sales over $1000, we need to calculate the additional commission. Since the sales amount is $2500, the amount over $1000 is $1500. The commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%. Therefore, the additional commission is:

Additional Commission = ($1500 * 10%) / 100
= ($1500 * 0.1) / 100
= $150

Total Commission = Commission for sales up to $1000 + Additional Commission
= $300 + $150
= $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"To determine the number of additional water bottles Bill needs to purchase, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles required for the guests, which is 70 guests * 2 bottles per guest = 140 bottles. 

Next, we subtract the number of bottles Bill already has from the total number of bottles needed: 140 - 48 = 92.

Therefore, Bill needs to purchase 92 additional bottles of water for his party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{92}$"
"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we can break down the problem into two parts: finding the time it takes to swim 3 miles on each day and then subtracting the time for the cold day from the time for the hot day.

First, we need to find the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a hot day. We know that he swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Let's denote the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a cold day as x. Then, the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day is 2x + 2.

We are given that Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, so we can set up the equation:
x = 16

Now, we can find the time it takes to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2x + 2 = 2(16) + 2 = 34 minutes

To find the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3(34) = 102 minutes

Next, we find the time it takes to swim 3 miles on a cold day:
3(16) = 48 minutes

Now, we can find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take John to save $80, we can use the concept of simple interest. 

First, we need to calculate John's weekly earnings: 

Weekly earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked per day * Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $2/hour * 5 hours/day * 4 days/week
Weekly earnings = $40/week

Now, we can divide the amount he wants to save ($80) by his weekly earnings ($40) to find the number of weeks:

Number of weeks = Amount to save / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40
Number of weeks = 2

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the total cost of the lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub. 

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is 3 * $40 = $120.

The total cost for both subs is the sum of their individual costs: $40 + $120 = $160.

The final answer is: $160"
"To determine the total number of holes in the bag of buttons, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of holes in each type of button and then summing the results.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We are given that x + y = 21 (since there are 21 buttons in total). We also know that the number of holes in the buttons with two holes is 2x and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 4y.

The total number of holes in the bag can be represented as 2x + 4y. Since we know that x + y = 21, we can express y as 21 - x. Substituting this into the expression for the total number of holes, we get:

2x + 4(21 - x)
= 2x + 84 - 4x
= -2x + 84

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since x represents the number of buttons with two holes, it must be a non-negative integer. We can try different values of x to find the one that satisfies the condition x + y = 21.

Let's try x = 7 (since we know there are 7 buttons with two holes). Then, y = 21 - 7 = 14.

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes:

2x + 4y
= 2(7) + 4(14)
= 14 + 56
= 70

Therefore, the total number of holes in the bag is 70.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we can apply the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can express this as a ratio: Zack's locker size = 1/2 * Timothy's locker size.

Let T represent Timothy's locker size in cubic inches. Then, Zack's locker size = (1/2)T.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can express this as another ratio: Peter's locker size = (1/4) * Zack's locker size.

Substituting the expression for Zack's locker size, we get: Peter's locker size = (1/4) * (1/2)T = (1/8)T.

Given that Timothy's locker size is 24 cubic inches, we can substitute T = 24 into the expression for Peter's locker size: Peter's locker size = (1/8) * 24 = 3 cubic inches.

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches in size.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake, we first need to establish the amount he currently consumes. Since Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia's daily intake is 0.5 * 4 = 2 cups. Given that Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, his current intake is 2 * 10 = 20 cups.

The doctor has advised Juan to reduce his intake to 4 cups. To find the reduction, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake: 20 - 4 = 16 cups.

However, the question asks for the reduction, not the total amount to be reduced. Therefore, the correct answer is the difference between his current intake and the recommended amount.

The correct reduction in Juan's daily coffee intake is 16 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Given that there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we can calculate the total number of rodents by adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs.

Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G. We are given that H = 3 * 10 = 30 and G = 3 * 5 = 15.

The total number of rodents (T) can be calculated as the sum of hamsters and guinea pigs: T = H + G.

T = 30 + 15
T = 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To determine the average weight of the three friends, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean:

Mean = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds and Susan's weight is 20 pounds less than Mark's, we can express Susan's weight as 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Since Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's, we can calculate his weight as 2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the sum of their weights:

Sum of weights = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
= 150 + 130 + 260
= 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the sum of their weights by the number of individuals:

Mean = (Sum of weights) / Number of individuals
= 540 / 3
= 180 pounds

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we can utilize the concept of relative motion and trigonometry. 

Given that the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, we can calculate the total angle it has moved upward in 10 hours as 5 * 10 = 50 degrees. 

The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees. After 10 hours, the sun's angle will be the sum of the initial angle and the total angle it has moved upward, which is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer: $\boxed{82}$"
"To determine the total cost of the birthday candles, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old. As a result, James needs 2 * 5 = 10 candles.

Next, we can calculate the total cost by dividing the total number of candles by 5 (the number of candles per pack) and then multiplying by the cost per pack ($3). This can be represented by the expression: (10 / 5) * 3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost: (10 / 5) * 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of pages she read in the first week and then adding it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, we need to find out how many minutes Judy spent reading in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can calculate the total minutes she spent reading in the first week as follows:

15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total minutes into pages. We know that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 and multiply the result by 2:

(105 minutes) / (1.5 minutes/page) * (2 pages/1.5 minutes) = 70 pages

Now, we can add the number of pages she read in the first week (70 pages) to the number of pages she read in the second week (100 pages) to find the total number of pages she read in two weeks:

70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

The final answer is: $\boxed{170}$"
"To determine the number of sandwiches left, we can employ the concept of subtraction. Cody and Trevor initially had 12 sandwiches. Cody consumed a third of the sandwiches, which can be represented as 1/3 × 12. 

To calculate 1/3 × 12, we can multiply 12 by 1/3, which is equivalent to dividing 12 by 3. 

12 ÷ 3 = 4

Trevor then consumed a quarter of the sandwiches, which can be represented as 1/4 × 12. 

To calculate 1/4 × 12, we can multiply 12 by 1/4, which is equivalent to dividing 12 by 4. 

12 ÷ 4 = 3

The total number of sandwiches consumed by Cody and Trevor is the sum of the sandwiches eaten by each individual. 

4 (Cody's sandwiches) + 3 (Trevor's sandwiches) = 7

To find the number of sandwiches left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the initial number of sandwiches. 

12 (initial sandwiches) - 7 (sandwiches consumed) = 5

Therefore, there are 5 sandwiches left.

The final answer is 5."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the relationship between Shiloh's and his nephew's ages. Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N.

Given that Shiloh is 44 years old today, we have:

S = 44

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the problem into distinct components and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the amount of money the tooth fairy left for the first tooth as $5.00. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, resulting in a total of 3 * $1.00 = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth. Therefore, the total amount for the last two teeth is 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon by adding the amounts for each set of teeth: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To determine the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, the number of goals scored by Anna as A, and the number of goals scored by Richie as R.

Given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can express this relationship as:

R = M + 20

Additionally, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, which can be represented as:

R = A + 45

We are also given that Richie scored 80 goals. Substituting R = 80 into the first equation, we can solve for M:

80 = M + 20
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Now that we have found M, we can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for A:

80 = A + 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we have found the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by all three:

Total goals = R + M + A
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we can break down his expenses into two categories: wooden action figures and plastic action figures.

Initially, Peter has $70. He spends $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, for a total of 3 days. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

$5 * 3 = $15

This leaves him with $70 - $15 = $55.

For the remaining 4 days (Thursday to Sunday), Peter buys plastic action figures at $2 each. The total number of plastic action figures he can purchase is:

$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he cannot buy a fraction of a figure, we can round down to 27 plastic action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is the sum of the wooden and plastic action figures:

3 (wooden) + 27 (plastic) = 30

Therefore, Peter will have 30 action figures by the end of the week.

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we can break down the expenses into distinct categories and apply basic arithmetic operations.

"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

First, we calculate the total number of roses needed per month by multiplying the number of roses ordered by each shop by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks). 

Let's denote the number of roses ordered by the first, second, and third flower shops as R1, R2, and R3, respectively. We are given that R1 = 20, R2 = 15, and R3 = 30. The total number of roses needed per month (T) can be calculated as:

T = R1 + R2 + R3
T = 20 + 15 + 30
T = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses per week by 4 to find the total roses needed per month:
T = 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month
T = 260 roses/month

Ford grows 40 roses every week. To find out how many roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed:
Lack = T - 40 * 4
Lack = 260 - 160
Lack = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can utilize the concept of present value and the formula for calculating the future value of a series of periodic payments. However, in this scenario, we are dealing with a simple subtraction problem, as the interest rate is not provided.

Given that Katina removes $100 from her account every month, we can calculate the total amount removed in 2 years (24 months) as:

Total amount removed = $100 * 24
= $2400

Now, subtracting the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total amount removed
= $3000 - $2400
= $600

Therefore, the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600."
"To calculate the net profit of the food truck, we can employ the following steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue generated from selling 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each:
Total Revenue = Number of Sandwiches × Price per Sandwich
Total Revenue = 10 × $7.00
Total Revenue = $70.00

2. Calculate the total cost incurred by the food truck:
Cost of Bread per Loaf = $3.00
Number of Loaves Needed for 10 Sandwiches = 1
Cost of Bread = Number of Loaves × Cost of Bread per Loaf
Cost of Bread = 1 × $3.00
Cost of Bread = $3.00

Cost of Cheese and Condiments per 10 Sandwiches = $30.00
Total Cost = Cost of Bread + Cost of Cheese and Condiments
Total Cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total Cost = $33.00

The area of the room can be calculated as the product of its length and width: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet can be calculated by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding can be calculated by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal can be calculated by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation can be calculated by multiplying the area by the cost per square foot: 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is the sum of the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

The final answer is: $10512"
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

Let's break down the data:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
= 280

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day."
"To determine the final value of the number train, we can break down the problem into a series of mathematical operations. Let's denote the starting value as 'x'. According to the problem, the starting value is 20, so x = 20.

The problem states that the starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. Mathematically, this can be represented as (x + x/2) / 5.

The problem also states that the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. Mathematically, this can be represented as ((x + x/2) / 5) * (x - 12).

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the equation: ((20 + 20/2) / 5) * (20 - 12).

First, calculate the value inside the parentheses: (20 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6.

Next, calculate the value of the second parentheses: 20 - 12 = 8.

Now, multiply the results: 6 * 8 = 48.

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the total number of cards the boy and his brother have together, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the number of cards the boy has as B and the number of cards his brother has as Br. We are given that the boy has 5 cards, so B = 5. We are also told that his brother has 3 fewer cards, which can be expressed as Br = B - 3.

Substituting the value of B into the equation for Br, we get Br = 5 - 3 = 2.

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of cards the boy and his brother have together: B + Br = 5 + 2 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 

(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 

4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

To find the correct temperature setting, we add the calculated value to the original temperature: 

520 + 20.8 = 540.8

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540.8}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we can utilize the concept of time addition. Given that the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, and the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, we can convert both times to minutes for uniformity.

The first movie's duration in minutes is 90 minutes, and the second movie's duration in minutes is 125 minutes. To find the total time, we add these two values:

90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the combined value of the two houses, we can calculate the value of Juan's house by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes each of them brought.

Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she brought twice as many dishes as cups, the number of dishes she brought is 2 x 12 = 24.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so the number of dishes her friend brought is 24 + 20 = 44.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that 90 single-use contacts comprise one box and will last Pete 45 days, and each box is currently 10% off at $100.00, we can break down the problem as follows:

First, calculate the discounted price of one box: $100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Since Pete is purchasing two boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Next, we need to find the total number of pairs of contacts in two boxes. As each box contains 90 pairs, two boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

Now, we can calculate the cost per pair by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"To determine the difference in earnings between John and Jill, we can calculate their individual earnings based on the given information.

Let's denote Jill's hours worked on Saturday as J_S and Jill's hours worked on Sunday as J_U. We are given that Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday (J_S = 2) and 1 hour on Sunday (J_U = 1). 

Since John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, his hours worked on Saturday can be calculated as 2 * J_S = 2 * 2 = 4 hours. Similarly, John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so his hours worked on Sunday can be calculated as 3 * J_U = 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The total hours worked by John is the sum of his hours worked on Saturday and Sunday, which is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. 

Jill's total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. 

Given that both John and Jill earn $10 per hour, John's total earnings can be calculated as 7 * $10 = $70, and Jill's total earnings can be calculated as 3 * $10 = $30.

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first calculate the total calories burned during her physical activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours engaging in aerobics, which burns 500 calories per hour, resulting in a total of 2 * 500 = 1000 calories. Additionally, she spends 1 hour running, burning 600 calories per hour, adding 600 calories to the total. 

The total calories burned is the sum of the calories burned from aerobics and running: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Since Hannah requires 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can calculate the total amount of water needed by dividing the total calories burned by 200 and then multiplying by 100.

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: $\boxed{800}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans. Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

We are given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Furthermore, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as:

G = 1.01B

Substituting the expressions for R and G into the first equation, we get:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Combine the B terms:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we have found the value of B, we can calculate the values of R and G:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the average of Jared's typing speeds, we can use the formula for the mean:

Mean = (Initial speed + Increased speed + New speed) / Number of measurements

Given the initial speed of 47 words per minute (WPM), the increased speed of 52 WPM, and the new speed of 57 WPM, we can plug these values into the formula:

Mean = (47 + 52 + 57) / 3

First, calculate the sum of the speeds:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, divide the sum by 3:
Mean = 156 / 3
Mean = 52

Therefore, the average of Jared's typing speeds is 52 WPM."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over the 5-week period.

Let's denote the weight change per week for the Cheerios option as -1.25 pounds/week and for the donuts option as +1.75 pounds/week. The total weight change over 5 weeks can be calculated as:

Weight change for Cheerios = -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
Weight change for donuts = +1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = +8.75 pounds

The difference in weight between the two options is the absolute value of the weight change for donuts minus the weight change for Cheerios:

Difference in weight = |8.75 - (-6.25)| = |8.75 + 6.25| = 15 pounds

Therefore, the difference in weight between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast over a 5-week period is 15 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of people invited by Alex, which is 100. Then, we consider the additional guests brought by these individuals. Since each of the 100 invited people will also invite 2 friends, we multiply 100 by 2 to account for the additional guests, resulting in 200. 

However, we also need to factor in the 10 friends Alex directly invited, as well as the 8 of their spouses. This adds 18 more individuals to the total count. 

Now, we can calculate the total number of people attending the event by summing up the initial invitees, the friends they invited, and the additional guests: 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, we can follow the given information step by step. 

First, we know the weight of the Affenpinscher is 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund's weight is 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.

Next, the Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, which is 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.

Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff's weight is 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16, and the shipping cost is $4. Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping cost is twice the shipping cost on Amazon, which is 2 * $4 = $8. Thus, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find the difference in cost between Amazon and eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1.

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to surpass Mark's window height, we can model the growth of the beanstalk using exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day t as h(t). We can express the height of the beanstalk on day t as:

h(t) = 4 * 2^(t-1)

We want to find the smallest integer value of t such that h(t) > 20.

20 < 4 * 2^(t-1)

Dividing both sides by 4:

5 < 2^(t-1)

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

log2(5) < t - 1

Adding 1 to both sides:

log2(5) + 1 < t

Since log2(5) ≈ 2.32, we have:

2.32 + 1 < t

3.32 < t

Since t must be an integer, the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is 4.

Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total grams of protein John gets per week, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. 

First, we need to establish the amount of protein per gram of mushrooms. Given that a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and contains 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein content per gram as follows:

Protein content per gram = Total protein per cup / Total weight per cup
Protein content per gram = 3 grams / 100 grams
Protein content per gram = 0.03 grams/gram

Now, we can calculate the total grams of protein John gets per day by multiplying the protein content per gram by the total grams of mushrooms he consumes per day:

Total protein per day = Protein content per gram * Total grams of mushrooms per day
Total protein per day = 0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams
Total protein per day = 6 grams

Finally, we can calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week by multiplying the total grams of protein per day by 7:

Total protein per week = Total protein per day * 7
Total protein per week = 6 grams * 7
Total protein per week = 42 grams

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Jerry's current age as x.

Given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides yields:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides results in:

10 = x

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10.

To determine Jerry's age in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Thus, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To determine the number of hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost of the dental work, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount George still owes after the deposit: $4500 (total cost of the dental work) - $600 (deposit) = $3900.

Next, we divide the remaining amount by George's hourly wage to find the number of hours he needs to work: $3900 ÷ $15/hour = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours to cover the remaining cost of the dental work.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle (x) and the third angle is three times the smallest angle (3x), we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can determine the measures of the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

Since the largest angle is 90 degrees, the correct answer is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball.

Colby's total amount of money can be calculated as follows:

8 quarters = 8 x $0.25 = $2.00
6 dimes = 6 x $0.10 = $0.60
14 nickels = 14 x $0.05 = $0.70
15 pennies = 15 x $0.01 = $0.15

Adding these amounts together, we get: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find the number of gumballs Colby can buy:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$"
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet: 

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in the store is 48.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we calculate the weight he initially increased by 50%, and then subtract 2 pounds from that result.

The initial weight is 8 pounds. Fifty percent of 8 pounds is calculated as 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. 

The weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

Finally, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds to find the weight Jamaal now uses: 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds."
"To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we can break down his gaming activity into three distinct periods: the first year, the second year, and the third year.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This results in a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve again receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month, yielding a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and purchases 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month, resulting in a total of 5 + 24 = 29 games. Furthermore, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

Therefore, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we can utilize the concept of constant velocity. Given that the plane maintains a constant velocity, we can apply the formula:

Time = Distance / Velocity

First, we need to calculate the velocity of the plane, which is the distance traveled divided by the time taken:

Velocity = Distance / Time
Velocity = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Velocity = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this velocity to find the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = Distance / Velocity
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to calculate their individual hourly production rates and then multiply these rates by the total number of hours worked.

Ruiz's production rate can be calculated as follows:

Ruiz's production rate = Total production / Total hours worked
Ruiz's production rate = 120 pounds / 2 hours
Ruiz's production rate = 60 pounds per hour

Marissa's production rate can be calculated as 3/4 of Ruiz's production rate:

Marissa's production rate = (3/4) * Ruiz's production rate
Marissa's production rate = (3/4) * 60 pounds per hour
Marissa's production rate = 45 pounds per hour

Now, we can calculate the total amount of chocolates made by both Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours:

Total production = Ruiz's production rate * Total hours worked + Marissa's production rate * Total hours worked
Total production = 60 pounds per hour * 12 hours + 45 pounds per hour * 12 hours
Total production = 720 pounds + 540 pounds
Total production = 1260 pounds

Therefore, the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we can calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, Howard spent $8.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 × $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 × $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88
= $12

Therefore, Howard has $12 left.

The final answer is $12."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can employ the concept of linear equations. Let's break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

During the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This can be represented by the equation:

Total earnings (first 4 hours) = (15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup) * 4 hours
= 15 * 0.50 * 4
= $30

In the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This can be represented by the equation:

Total earnings (next 2 hours) = (10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup) * 2 hours
= 10 * 0.60 * 2
= $12

To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods:

Total earnings = $30 + $12
= $42

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year and then divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by this value.

First, we need to find the number of rotations per mile. Given that the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the rotations per mile as follows:

Rotations per mile = 725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Next, we multiply the rotations per mile by the number of miles driven per month (400 miles) to find the total number of rotations per month:

Rotations per month = 362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of rotations per year:

Rotations per year = 145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we can divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo (10,440,000 rotations) by the total number of rotations per year to find the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:

Years before replacement = Total rotations / Rotations per year = 10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

The tire needs to be replaced in 6 years."
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that 2 pumps yield 120 washings, we can establish a ratio of washings to pumps. 

Let's denote the cost of 1 pump as x. The total cost of 120 washings is $24.00. We can set up a proportion to find the cost of 1 pump:

2 pumps / 120 washings = 1 pump / x washings
2x = 120
x = 120 / 2
x = 60

Now, we can convert the cost from dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

x = 60 * 100 = 6000 cents

Therefore, each pump costs 6000 cents.

The final answer is 6000."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first determine the discounted price of the shirt. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount. 

The discount amount can be calculated as follows: 
$25 * 0.3 = $7.50

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: 
$17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount. Assuming a standard sales tax rate of 8% (as implied by the context), we can calculate the tax amount as follows: 
$52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70

To find out how much money Joe will have left, we subtract the total cost from his initial budget: 
$50 - $56.70 = -$6.70

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money, this indicates that he will not have enough money to purchase the outfit."
"To determine the total amount of butter required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to produce 1 dozen croissants, we can establish a conversion factor of 1/4 pound per dozen. To find the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants per day, we multiply the number of croissants by the conversion factor.

Let's calculate the daily butter requirement:

4 dozen croissants/day × (1/4 pound/dozen) = 1 pound/day

To find the total butter requirement for 7 days, we multiply the daily amount by 7:

1 pound/day × 7 days = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to produce 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the cost difference between repaving Monica's and Lewis' streets, we can calculate the cost of repaving each street separately and then find the difference.

The cost of repaving a street is given by the formula: Cost = Length × Rate

For Monica's street: Cost = 150 meters × $194/meter = $29,100

For Lewis' street: Cost = 490 meters × $194/meter = $94,660

The difference in cost is: $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To calculate the total cost of John's research, we can break it down into two parts: the initial 5 months and the remaining 5 months. The initial 5 months had a constant funding of $100,000 per month, while the remaining 5 months had a funding that increased by 50% each month.

The total cost for the first 5 months is:
$100,000 x 5 = $500,000

For the remaining 5 months, we can model the funding as an arithmetic sequence with a first term of $100,000 and a common difference of $50,000 (50% increase). The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:
an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:
- Month 6: $100,000 + (6 - 1) * $50,000 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 + (7 - 1) * $50,000 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 + (8 - 1) * $50,000 = $337,500
- Month 9: $337,500 + (9 - 1) * $50,000 = $506,250
- Month 10: $506,250 + (10 - 1) * $50,000 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $2,077,625."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat each player ate and add them together.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces. The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat. Therefore, we can ignore their contributions to the total.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we can utilize the concept of daily posting frequency and the number of days in the month. Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, we can multiply the daily posting frequency by the total number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = Daily posting frequency * Total number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93."
"To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we can employ the concept of unitary method. This method involves multiplying the total number of loads of laundry done in a year by the amount of water used per load and then multiplying the result by the cost per gallon.

Given that Gary does laundry twice a week, the total number of loads in a year is 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads. Since each load uses 20 gallons of water, the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15. Therefore, the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

The final answer is: $312"
"To determine the total amount Scarlett spent, we can calculate the cost of each item and sum them together.

The cost of the aquarium is $10.00. The cost of the rocks is 2 x $2.50 = $5.00. The cost of the coral is 3 x $2.00 = $6.00. The cost of the fish is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00. The cost of the fish food is $2.00.

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

Therefore, Scarlett spent $33.00."
"To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we can apply the concept of exponential growth. The initial height of the beanstalk is 3 inches, and it doubles in height every week. In the first week, it grows by a factor of 2, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the second week, it grows by another factor of 2, resulting in 6 * 2 = 12 inches. In the third week, it grows by 4 inches, resulting in 12 + 4 = 16 inches.

Therefore, the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 16 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince sells in a day, which is given as 15 kg/hour * 10 hours = 150 kg/day. 

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull (750 kg) by the daily meat sales (150 kg) to find the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat.

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium by multiplying the number of rows by the number of seats in each row: 
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators, which is one-fourth of the total seats:
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

The remaining seats are then calculated by subtracting the seats occupied by administrators from the total seats:
Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Now, we calculate the number of seats occupied by parents, which is one-third of the remaining seats:
Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats

Finally, we determine the number of seats occupied by students by subtracting the seats occupied by parents from the remaining seats:
Seats occupied by students = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections. Since each intersection has 4 poles with 4 street lights each, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 poles * 4 lights/pole = 16 lights per intersection. With 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 16 lights/intersection * 4 intersections = 64 lights.

Next, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 64 - 20 = 44.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the number of times each DVD has been played and its respective lifespan.

Let's calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times left
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times left

The total number of times both DVDs can be played is the sum of their remaining lifespans: 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1509}$"
"To calculate the total cost of John's physical therapy, we can employ the concept of total hours attended and multiply it by the cost per hour. Given that John attended therapy twice a week for 6 weeks, we can first determine the total number of sessions:

2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 sessions

Since each session is 2 hours long, we can calculate the total hours attended as:

12 sessions * 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = Total Hours * Cost per Hour
Total Cost = 24 hours * $125/hour
Total Cost = $3000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we can break down the problem into manageable parts.

First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews throughout the day. Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, and the school day lasts 8 hours, we can calculate the number of pieces he chews at school as follows:

Number of pieces chewed at school = (8 hours / 2 hours) = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so the total number of pieces chewed outside of school is:

Total pieces chewed outside of school = 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 2 pieces

Now, we can calculate the total number of pieces chewed throughout the day:

Total pieces chewed = pieces chewed at school + pieces chewed outside of school = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has:

20 - 6 = 14 pieces left

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister. Therefore, Jim has:

14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we can utilize a simple arithmetic approach. We know that Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. This implies that her current age is 16 - 12 = 4 years.

To find her age 4 years from now, we can add 4 to her current age. 

Current age = 4 years
Age in 4 years = 4 + 4 = 8 years

Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

Answer: 8"

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of $27. 

The basketball coach purchased 8 basketballs at $14 each, resulting in a total expenditure of $112.

The difference in spending between the two coaches can be calculated as follows:

$112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of bloomed flowers by multiplying the total number of flowers by this fraction.

Let's denote the total number of flowers as 'T'. We know that T = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers.

The fraction of bloomed flowers is 4/5, which can be represented as a decimal: 4/5 = 0.8.

Number of bloomed flowers = T * 0.8
= 200 * 0.8
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160.

Final answer: 160"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we must first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. This can be achieved by dividing the given speed by 1000, as 1 Mb equals 1000 kb.

Let's perform the conversion:

20 kb/second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/second

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can further convert the speed to Mb per hour by multiplying by 60:

0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed that week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of cars towed on the first three days and the number of cars towed on the remaining four days.

Let's denote the number of cars towed on each of the first three days as 'a' and the number of cars towed on each of the remaining four days as 'b'. We are given that 'a' is 10 and 'b' is 10 - 4 = 6.

The total number of cars towed on the first three days is 3a, and the total number of cars towed on the remaining four days is 4b. Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 3a + 4b.

Substituting the values of 'a' and 'b', we get:
Total number of cars towed = 3(10) + 4(6)
= 30 + 24
= 54

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to meet the minimum height requirement, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years as 't'. Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, his height after 't' years can be represented as:

Height = Initial Height + (Annual Growth Rate * Time)
Height = 40 + 2t

The required height to ride the roller coaster is 48 inches. To find the time it takes for Adam to reach this height, we can set up an equation:

40 + 2t = 48

Subtracting 40 from both sides:

2t = 8

Dividing both sides by 2:

t = 4

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit made on each car and then multiply it by the number of cars sold.

The cost of each car is $25,000, and the company pays 30% of this amount as the acquisition cost. This leaves the selling price as $25,000 - (0.3 * $25,000) = $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

The profit per car is the selling price minus the acquisition cost, which is $17,500 - $7,500 = $10,000.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $10,000 = $100,000.

James' commission is 10% of the total profit, which is 0.1 * $100,000 = $10,000.

Therefore, James made $10,000."
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to calculate the total number of riders who can stay upright. Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we can calculate this as 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 0.6 by 25, which equals 15 women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total price of the three jewels, we can utilize a systematic approach. Let's denote the price of the diamond jewel as D, the price of the gold jewel as G, and the price of the silver jewel as S.

Given that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel, we can express this relationship as:

G = (4/5)D

We are also given that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel, which can be represented as:

S = G - $400

Furthermore, we know the price of the diamond jewel is $2000. We can substitute this value into the equation for the gold jewel:

G = (4/5)(2000)
G = 1600

Now that we have the price of the gold jewel, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel:

S = G - $400
S = 1600 - 400
S = 1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we can add their individual prices:

Total price = D + G + S
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200
= 4800

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We are given the following information:

1. S = 16 (number of snowflake stamps)
2. T = S + 3 (number of truck stamps is 3 more than the number of snowflake stamps)
3. R = T - 9 (number of rose stamps is 9 fewer than the number of truck stamps)

We can substitute the first equation into the second and third equations to express T and R in terms of S:

T = S + 3
R = (S + 3) - 9
R = S - 6

Now, we can express the total number of stamps as the sum of the individual types:

Total = S + T + R
Total = S + (S + 3) + (S - 6)
Total = 3S - 3

Substituting S = 16 into the equation, we get:

Total = 3(16) - 3
Total = 48 - 3
Total = 45

Therefore, Max bought 45 stamps in total."
"To determine the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since they are moving in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting Tom's speed from Bob's speed.

Relative speed = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
Relative speed = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, since they are moving in the same direction, we consider the absolute difference in their speeds. The negative sign indicates that Tom is moving in the opposite direction.

Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Now, we can apply the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed

Time = 75 miles / 15 mph

Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T. We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We are also given that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, which can be expressed as D = N - 6. Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Furthermore, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, which can be expressed as T = D + 3. Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class.

Let's denote the total cost of the classes as C and the maximum cost per class as M. We are given that C = $60 and M = $10. We can calculate the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for as follows:

C / M = 60 / 10 = 6

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we can find the maximum number of classes he can miss by subtracting the number of classes he has already attended from the maximum number of classes his parents are willing to pay for:

Maximum number of classes that can be missed = Maximum number of classes - Number of classes already attended
= 6 - 10
= -4

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Since Manny can't miss a negative number of classes, we need to reconsider our approach.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, it means they are willing to pay for 6 classes at $10 per class, which totals $60. This leaves $0 remaining for additional classes. Since Manny has already paid for 10 classes, he has already exceeded the budget. Therefore, he can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total weekly production, we can calculate the combined daily production of Julie and Jewel. Since Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, we can express Julie's daily production as 2 * 50 = 100 customers.

The total daily production is the sum of their individual productions: 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we multiply the daily production by the number of working days in a week: 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize algebraic methods to represent the given information and solve for the unknown variable, Lynn's distance.

Let's denote Lynn's distance as L. According to the problem, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 4 miles. Therefore, Reggie's distance can be represented as 5P, where P = 4. So, Reggie's distance is 5P = 5(4) = 20 miles.

Additionally, Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, which can be expressed as 5P = L + 3. Substituting the value of P, we get 20 = L + 3.

Now, we can solve for L by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: L = 20 - 3.

L = 17

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can apply the concept of unit prices and the principle of multiplication.

First, we need to establish the unit prices for each item. Given that four apples cost $5.20, the unit price of one apple is $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30. Similarly, the unit price of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of 5 apples: 5 x $1.30 = $6.50.

Next, we calculate the total cost of 5 oranges: 5 x $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, we add the total costs of apples and oranges to obtain the overall cost: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to determine the volume of the hole first. The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is given by the formula:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth).

Given that the length (l) is 6 feet, the width (w) is 4 feet, and the depth (h) is 3 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

V = 6 * 4 * 3
V = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the volume by the rate:

Time = V * rate
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we can break down the costs of each feature and add them to the base price.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an additional $7,500, the leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $2,500, the running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,000, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

We can calculate the total cost by adding these amounts to the base price:

$30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we can break down the problem into two components: the raise and the bonus.

First, we calculate the raise: 5% of $20,000 is calculated as 0.05 × $20,000 = $1,000. This represents a monthly increase in Tim's salary.

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary, equal to $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.

The new monthly salary is the sum of the original salary and the raise and bonus: $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000.

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12: $31,000 × 12 = $372,000.

The final answer is: $372,000"
"To calculate the total cost of James' purchases, we can break down the costs of each item and then sum them up.

The cost of suits: 10 suits * $750 per suit = $7,500
The cost of dress pants: 10 pants * (1/5 * $750) = 10 * $150 = $1,500
The cost of dress shirts: 10 shirts * $60 per shirt = $600

Now, let's add the costs together: $7,500 + $1,500 + $600 = $9,600

The total cost of everything is $9,600."
"To calculate the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we can utilize the concept of multiplication and addition. 

The news website publishes 20 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website can be calculated as:

20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles

Similarly, the sister company publishes 10 articles per day, and there are 28 days in February. Thus, the total number of articles published by the sister company can be calculated as:

10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

To determine the total number of articles published by both websites, we can add the number of articles published by each website:

560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can analyze the given information systematically.

Let's denote Steve's age as S, his wife's age as W, their son's age as T, and his son's wife's age as SW. We are given the following information:

1. S = 60
2. W = S + 4
3. T = W / 2
4. SW = T - 3

We can substitute the value of W from equation (2) into equation (3) to find T:

T = (S + 4) / 2
T = (60 + 4) / 2
T = 64 / 2
T = 32

Now that we have T, we can find SW using equation (4):

SW = T - 3
SW = 32 - 3
SW = 29

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can calculate the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

Let's denote the number of portions as 'n' and the weight of each portion as 'w'. In this case, n = 8 and w = 2 kilograms. The total weight of flour in one bag can be calculated as:

Total weight = n * w
Total weight = 8 * 2
Total weight = 16 kilograms

Since we are asked to find the total amount of flour in three bags, we can multiply the total weight of one bag by 3:

Total weight in three bags = 3 * 16
Total weight in three bags = 48 kilograms

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms."
"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa, the distance she biked is:
12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley, the distance he biked is:
10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we can find the total distance by adding the individual distances together:
Total Distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{79}$"
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we can employ the concept of work and rate. Let's break down the problem into two parts: digging through the soil and digging through the clay.

The rate at which Bill digs through the soil is 4 feet per hour, and the rate at which he digs through the clay is half that, or 2 feet per hour. We can represent these rates as follows:

Rate of digging through soil = 4 feet/hour
Rate of digging through clay = 2 feet/hour

The total distance Bill needs to cover is 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay. We can calculate the time it takes to dig through each material separately and then add them together.

Time to dig through soil = Total distance of soil / Rate of digging through soil
Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour
Time to dig through soil = 6 hours

Time to dig through clay = Total distance of clay / Rate of digging through clay
Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour
Time to dig through clay = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. Since he wants to purchase one of each flavor for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

Let's denote the number of cupcakes for Howie, his teacher, and each classmate as 'x'. Since he wants to buy one of each flavor, the total number of cupcakes can be represented as:

Total cupcakes = x (for Howie) + x (for his teacher) + 25x (for his 25 classmates)

We know that he wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each of these individuals, so we can rewrite the equation as:

Total cupcakes = 2x + 2 + 25x

Combine like terms:

Total cupcakes = 27x

Since we want to find the total number of cupcakes, we need to know the value of 'x'. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. Assuming Howie wants to buy 2 cupcakes for each of the 26 individuals (himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates), we can calculate the total number of cupcakes as:

Total cupcakes = 27x
Total cupcakes = 27(2)
Total cupcakes = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To determine the total number of likes on Fishio's Instagram post, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the initial number of likes. Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number, we can set up the equation:

Initial likes + 20000 = 70 * Initial likes

Let's represent the initial likes as 'x'. Then, the equation becomes:

x + 20000 = 70x

Now, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 'x' from both sides of the equation:

20000 = 69x

Next, we divide both sides by 69 to isolate 'x':

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.52 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a like, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the decimal value for the sake of precision.

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial likes and the 20000 new likes:

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 288.52 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.52

The final answer is: $\boxed{20128.52}$"
"To determine the difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we can calculate the total cost of the pomegranates on both days.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount. The total cost on Tuesday can be calculated as:

Total Cost (Tuesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= (20 * $20) - $2
= $400 - $2
= $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost on Wednesday can be calculated as:

Total Cost (Wednesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
= (20 * $30) - (0.1 * $600)
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total Cost (Tuesday) - Total Cost (Wednesday)
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"To determine the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we need to find the sales from green hats in the first month. Since the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

Red Hat Sales = (1/2) * Green Hat Sales
$400 = (1/2) * Green Hat Sales
Green Hat Sales = $400 * 2
Green Hat Sales = $800

Next, we can calculate the total sales for the first month by adding the sales from red and green hats:
Total Sales (Month 1) = Red Hat Sales + Green Hat Sales
Total Sales (Month 1) = $400 + $800
Total Sales (Month 1) = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. We can calculate this as:
Total Sales (Month 2) = (3/4) * Total Sales (Month 1)
Total Sales (Month 2) = (3/4) * $1200
Total Sales (Month 2) = $900

Finally, we can find the total sales for the two months by adding the sales from both months:
Total Sales (Two Months) = Total Sales (Month 1) + Total Sales (Month 2)
Total Sales (Two Months) = $1200 + $900
Total Sales (Two Months) = $2100

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total cost of James' horse-drawn carriage rental, we can break down the calculation into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of paid hours. Since James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, the total duration is 4 hours. However, he receives 1 hour of free time, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, which can be represented as 2 * $15 = $30 per hour. 

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the first paid hour and the cost of the remaining 2 hours, which is $15 + 2 * $30 = $15 + $60 = $75.

Therefore, James paid a total of $75 for the horse-drawn carriage rental.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use the following equation:

Weekly wage - Bank account balance = Amount withheld

Let's denote the weekly wage as W and the bank account balance as B. We are given that W = $300 and B = $420. We can plug these values into the equation:

W - B = Amount withheld
$300 - $420 = Amount withheld

Performing the subtraction, we get:

-$120 = Amount withheld

Since the result is a negative value, it indicates that the bank account was overdrawn by $120. This means that $120 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each deviled egg half requires one whole egg, we can multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will consume.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 * 3 = 48

To find the total number of eggs required, we divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2, as each egg yields 2 halves.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert this to dozens, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12, as there are 12 eggs in a dozen.

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party."
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from the total number of pages.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 1 by 3: 1/3 = 0.33.

Total pages = 15
Pages already written = 0.33 × 15 = 5

Pages left to write = Total pages - Pages already written
= 15 - 5
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can employ a simple division operation. 

The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day. 

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day
= 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can calculate the number of days before the deadline as follows:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining a plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly expenses, and the compounding effect of these costs over 12 months.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000. In addition to this, James pays a monthly rent of $5,000 to maintain the plane. Furthermore, he spends twice as much on fuel per month, which amounts to $10,000.

To determine the total cost for the first year, we can calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12. The total monthly expenses are $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

The total cost for the first year is the sum of the initial purchase price and the total monthly expenses multiplied by 12. This can be expressed as:

Total Cost = Initial Purchase Price + (Monthly Expenses x 12)
Total Cost = $150,000 + ($15,000 x 12)
Total Cost = $150,000 + $180,000
Total Cost = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year is $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can start by establishing the individual cooking times for each food item. Let's denote the cooking time for rice as R, pork as P, and beans as B. We are given that R = 30 minutes.

We are also given that P = R + 20, which allows us to calculate the cooking time for pork as P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

Furthermore, we know that B = (R + P) / 2. Substituting the values of R and P, we get B = (30 + 50) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total cooking time by adding the individual cooking times: Total Time = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can calculate the cost of each component and then find the difference.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as A and the cost of walnuts as W. We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. To find the total cost of this mixture, we can use the weighted average formula:

Cost of mixture 1 = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
= (1/2)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 5 + 5
= $10

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. Using the same formula:

Cost of mixture 2 = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
= (1/5)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 2 + 5
= $7

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

Difference in cost = Cost of mixture 1 - Cost of mixture 2
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the coffee and donut, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut.

First, let's calculate the cost of the coffee. Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate the cost as follows:

Let x be the cost of the normal brand per pound. Then, the cost of the more expensive brand is x + 0.20x = 1.20x.

Since the more expensive brand costs $6 per pound, we can set up the equation:

1.20x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.20:

x = 6 / 1.20
x = 5

So, the normal brand costs $5 per pound.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the coffee:

7 pounds x $5 per pound = $35

Next, let's add the cost of the donut, which is $2.

Total cost = $35 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $37

Therefore, the total cost of the coffee and donut is $37.

Final answer: $37"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. The costs of the items he purchased, excluding the apple pie, can be calculated as follows:

The cost of 2 bags of chips: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
The cost of a bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
The cost of a bottle of soda: $1.00
The total cost of these items: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we can subtract the total cost of these items from the total amount Gus spent to find the cost of the apple pie:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers James delivers to District B, we can utilize a simple arithmetic approach. Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as x. We are given that James delivers a total of 600 newspapers, with 198 newspapers going to District A and 209 newspapers going to District C. Therefore, the equation representing the total number of newspapers delivered can be written as:

x + 198 + 209 = 600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 407 = 600

Subtracting 407 from both sides of the equation yields:

x = 600 - 407

x = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To determine the total number of recipes John learns, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. Since the class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, we can express this as a product of the number of times the class meets per week and the duration of each class:

Total hours = (Number of times the class meets per week) × (Duration of each class)
Total hours = 4 × 2
Total hours = 8 hours

Next, we can calculate the total number of recipes John learns by dividing the total number of hours by the duration of each recipe learning session:

Number of recipes = Total hours ÷ Duration of each recipe learning session
Number of recipes = 8 hours ÷ 1.5 hours
Number of recipes = 8 ÷ 1.5
Number of recipes = 5.33

Since we cannot learn a fraction of a recipe, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to consider that John learns 5 recipes, as he would not be able to learn a fraction of a recipe.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of math teachers, we can calculate the percentage of teachers that are not history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, the remaining percentage represents the math teachers.

Percentage of math teachers = 100% - 60%
= 40%

Number of math teachers = 40% of 150
= 0.4 * 150
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

Total time = Number of math teachers * Hours slept per day
= 60 * 6
= 360 hours"
"To determine the amount of money each person would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the amount of money each person has. We are given that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Next, we are told that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

Now, we can find the total amount of money by adding the amounts of all three individuals:

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
= 120 + 90 + 150
= 360

To find the amount each person would have if they shared the total amount equally, we can divide the total amount by 3:

Amount per person = Total amount / 3
= 360 / 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"In basketball, games are typically divided into four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in professional and collegiate play. However, it's worth noting that some variations may exist in different leagues or levels of competition. 

To determine the total game duration, we can calculate the time for the four regular quarters and add the additional time for the extended quarter.

Total game time = (4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter) + 5 minutes
Total game time = 48 minutes + 5 minutes
Total game time = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we can break down the problem into two steps. First, we find the number of management employees, which is 20% of the total 50 employees.

Let's calculate 20% of 50:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Next, we need to find 30% of these 10 management employees, as they oversee the entire company. To do this, we multiply 10 by 0.30:
10 * 0.30 = 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we can apply the concept of unit conversion and scalar multiplication.

Let's break down the ingredients and their respective quantities per muffin:

- Flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin

To find the total amount of each ingredient needed for 16 muffins, we multiply the quantity per muffin by the number of muffins:

Flour: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons
Sugar: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons
Salt: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons

The total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins is the sum of these individual quantities: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{132}$"
"To determine the amount of candy each person would have if they pool and share it equally, we need to calculate the total amount of candy first. This can be done by adding the individual amounts of candy each person had:

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds
Total candy = 12 pounds

Since there are three people sharing the candy equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

Total candy ÷ 3 = 12 pounds ÷ 3
Total candy ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

Therefore, each person would have 4 pounds of candy.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the change Adam received, we must first calculate the total cost of the candies he purchased. The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 × $0.5 = $3.50, and the cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 × $0.75 = $7.50. The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received can be calculated as follows:

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
= $15 - $11
= $4

Therefore, Adam received $4 in change.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can analyze the given information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of days in the month as 30. We know that Christina's mood records span 30 days, consisting of 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the remaining days as neutral. The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This implies that the first 24 days (8 good + 8 bad + 8 neutral) have already been accounted for.

We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good, respectively. To find the number of good days left in the month, we can subtract the total number of good days already recorded from the total number of good days that could have been recorded in the month.

The total number of good days that could have been recorded in the month is 30 - 24 = 6 (since the first 24 days have already been accounted for). However, we know that 12 good days have already been recorded. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

Good days left = Total good days - Good days already recorded
= 6 - 12
= -6

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

We know that the first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This means that the first 24 days have already been accounted for, leaving 6 days remaining. We are also given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good, respectively. This implies that the remaining 3 days are part of the 6 remaining days. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

Good days left = 6 - 3
= 3

The final answer is 3."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sally has as x. Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can express this relationship as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. We first convert the initial height from feet to inches, as the growth rate is given in inches per day. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the initial height of 20 feet is equivalent to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Next, we determine the total growth required to reach the target height of 600 inches by subtracting the initial height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can calculate the number of days required to achieve the desired height by dividing the total growth required by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into stages.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, indicating a ratio of 1 toy per dog. With 8 additional dogs, the total number of dogs becomes 4 + 8 = 12. Since each dog requires one toy, James initially needs 12 toys.

However, upon returning, James finds that 3 dogs have left, reducing the number of dogs to 12 - 3 = 9. Consequently, James no longer needs the toys for the 3 absent dogs. Therefore, he requires 9 toys for the remaining 9 dogs.

To calculate the total number of toys James needs, we can subtract the initial number of toys he had (4) from the number of toys required for the remaining dogs (9). This yields 9 - 4 = 5 additional toys needed.

The total number of toys James needs is the sum of the initial number of toys he had (4) and the additional toys required (5), resulting in a total of 4 + 5 = 9 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the amount invested by Skyler, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we calculate Dylan's investment, which is 2/5 of the total amount of $1200. This can be expressed as:

Dylan's investment = (2/5) × 1200
= (2 × 1200) / 5
= 2400 / 5
= 480

Next, we find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment by subtracting his share from the total:
Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
= 1200 - 480
= 720

Then, we calculate Frances' investment, which is 2/3 of the remaining amount:
Frances' investment = (2/3) × 720
= (2 × 720) / 3
= 1440 / 3
= 480

Finally, we determine Skyler's investment by subtracting Frances' investment from the remaining amount:
Skyler's investment = Remaining amount - Frances' investment
= 720 - 480
= 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their desired total and the number of signatures they have already collected.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they want to collect is 100. 

The number of signatures they need to collect can be found by subtracting the total signatures they already have from their goal: 
Total signatures needed = Total desired signatures - Total signatures already collected
Total signatures needed = 100 - (C + J)
Total signatures needed = 100 - (20 + 44)
Total signatures needed = 100 - 64
Total signatures needed = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To determine Karen's earnings, we can start by calculating her hourly wage, which is twice Lorie's wage. Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen's hourly wage is:

2 * $10 = $20 per hour

Next, we need to calculate Karen's daily earnings. She works 3 hours per day, so her daily earnings are:

$20 per hour * 3 hours per day = $60 per day

Finally, we can calculate her earnings for two days:

$60 per day * 2 days = $120

Therefore, Karen earns $120 in two days.

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can utilize the concept of proportional reasoning. Given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can establish a ratio of potatoes to hash browns.

Let's denote the number of hash browns as H and the number of potatoes as P. We can express the ratio as:

H = 36 / 6
H = 6

Now, we can use this ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:

H = 96 / 6
H = 16

Therefore, 16 hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the excess weight of the group, we can calculate the total weight of the 9 individuals and then subtract the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 9 adults is:

Total weight = 9 × 80 kg = 720 kg

Since the maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg, we can find the excess weight by subtracting the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
= 720 kg - 700 kg
= 20 kg

The group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can utilize a linear system of equations. Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:

- K = Katarina's cookies
- M = Max's cookies
- C = Cookie Monster's cookies
- S = Summer's cookies

We are given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can substitute the expression for M from equation (2) into equation (1) to find the value of C:
K = (C + 12) - 5
68 = C + 7
C = 61

Now that we have the value of C, we can find the value of M:
M = C + 12
M = 61 + 12
M = 73

Next, we can find the value of S:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Finally, we can calculate the total number of cookies:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which can be represented as 0.5x. Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is given as 140cm. We can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

To solve for x, we can first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

1.5x = 140 - 20
1.5x = 120

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5 to isolate x:

x = 120 / 1.5
x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The final answer is: 80"
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. Let's denote the time taken to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode as T and the time taken in ""rabbit"" mode as R. We are given that T = 60 minutes and R = 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2)T + (1/2)R = Total Time

Substituting the given values, we get:

(1/2)(60) + (1/2)(40) = Total Time
30 + 20 = Total Time
50 minutes

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the remaining time John and Jack have to reach school without being late, we can calculate the time elapsed and subtract it from the total available time.

Given:
Total available time = 30 minutes
Time taken to reach the corner = 6 minutes
Time taken to reach the fire station = 13 minutes

Total time taken so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes

Time left = Total available time - Total time taken so far
Time left = 30 - 19
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to reach school without being late."
"To determine the total cost of Catherine's grocery purchase, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the cost of each item: 
- The cost of 1 kilo of apples is $4.
- The cost of 2 kilos of bananas is 2 x $2 = $4.
- The cost of 2 kilos of oranges is 2 x $3 = $6.

Now, we add the costs together: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"To determine the total number of cookies in the box, we must first calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 2:1. Given that Greta bakes 30 cookies, we can calculate Celinda's contribution as 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is the sum of Greta's and Celinda's contributions: 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

Next, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by the pair, which is 10, from the total number of cookies baked: 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the ages of the twins and triplets. Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as x. Since there are two sets of siblings, we can represent the ages of the twins and triplets as follows:

- Younger triplet: x
- Older triplet: x + 7
- Older twin: x + 14

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since the ages must be whole numbers, we can re-examine the equation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

Let the age of the younger triplet be x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 7, which results in:

- Younger triplet: 7
- Older triplet: 7 + 7 = 14
- Older twin: 7 + 14 = 21

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 7 + 14 + 21 = 42, which is less than 44. We can try x = 8:

- Younger triplet: 8
- Older triplet: 8 + 7 = 15
- Older twin: 8 + 14 = 22

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 8 + 15 + 22 = 45, which is greater than 44. Since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 7.33, but since x must be a whole number, we can try x = 7 and x = 8.

Let's try x = 7 and x = 8 again, but this time, we can use a different approach. Let's represent the ages of the twins and triplets as:

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we must first convert the time before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate this as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on homework. The time spent on math, reading, and history can be added together:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we can subtract the total homework time from the available time to find the time available for a nap:

Time available for nap = Time before dinner - Total homework time
= 180 minutes - 80 minutes
= 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes available for a nap."
"To determine the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can break down the problem into two separate calculations.

First, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the total cost of 10 lollipops is given by:

10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Given that each candy costs $3.20, the total cost of 10 candies is:

10 candies * $3.20/candy = $32.00

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

$4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we can calculate their monthly savings and then multiply it by 120 (12 months in a year).

Rong saves 20 coins per month, while Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This can be expressed as:

Neil's monthly savings = 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins

To find the total number of coins saved by each individual in a year, we multiply their monthly savings by 12:

Rong's yearly savings = 20 * 12 = 240 coins
Neil's yearly savings = 28 * 12 = 336 coins

Now, we can calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years:

Total coins Rong saves in 10 years = 240 * 10 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 10 years = 336 * 10 = 3360 coins

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings:

Total coins = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

Final answer: 5760"
"To determine the total cost of the vaccines, we can calculate the cost of two vaccines and then find the cost of the heartworm check. The cost of two vaccines is $20 * 2 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as 'x'. We can set up the equation: 0.6x = 40. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

The total bill is $66.67. To find out how much John leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought with him:
$125 - $66.67 = $58.33

The final answer is: $58.33"
"To determine the total cost of the crate, we can calculate the cost of each type of fruit and sum them together. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1. The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $32."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we can analyze the given information about the number of colored squares.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following relationships:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can express B, G, and W in terms of R:

B = R + 4
G = (R + 4) + 6
G = R + 10
W = (R + 10) - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can express the total number of squares in terms of R:

Total = R + B + G + W
Total = R + (R + 4) + (R + 10) + (R - 2)
Total = 4R + 12

Since we know R = 14, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Total = 4(14) + 12
Total = 56 + 12
Total = 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire, we must first establish the total number of chairs required for the event. Given that there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, we can calculate the total number of chairs needed as follows:

Total number of attendees = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Now, we can determine the total number of chairs needed by adding the number of high chairs and regular chairs:

Total number of chairs = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

To find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to acquire, we subtract the number of chairs already available from the total number of chairs required:

Additional chairs needed = Total number of chairs - Number of chairs available
= 48 - 8
= 40

Therefore, Mia needs 40 more chairs to accommodate the attendees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks in the field, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, and 20% of those bucks possess 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as follows:

Number of bucks = Total deer * 0.5
= 50 * 0.5
= 25

Now, we can calculate 20% of the number of bucks to find the number of 8-point bucks:

Number of 8-point bucks = Number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total points required for the class to go on the trip, we need to calculate the points for each student and then sum them up.

Let's denote Adam's points as A, Betty's points as B, Marta's points as M, and Tom's points as T. We are given the following information:

A = 50
B = A + 0.3A = 1.3A
M = 3T
T = B - 30

We can substitute the value of T in terms of A:
M = 3(B - 30)
M = 3B - 90

Now, we can express B in terms of A:
B = 1.3A
M = 3(1.3A) - 90
M = 3.9A - 90

Now, we can express the total points in terms of A:
Total points = A + B + M + T
Total points = A + 1.3A + (3.9A - 90) + (B - 30)
Total points = A + 1.3A + 3.9A - 90 + B - 30
Total points = 6.2A + B - 120

Substituting the value of B in terms of A:
Total points = 6.2A + 1.3A - 120
Total points = 7.5A - 120

We are given that the minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. To find the total points required, we can set up the equation:
7.5A - 120 = 400

Solving for A:
7.5A = 400 + 120
7.5A = 520
A = 520 / 7.5
A = 69.33

Now, we can find the total points:
Total points = 7.5A - 120
Total points = 7.5(69.33) - 120
Total points = 522.5 - 120
Total points = 402.5

"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can employ a simple exponential growth model. We start with Great Grandma Jones, who has 3 children. Each of these children has 3 children of their own, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren. Then, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, leading to 9 x 3 = 27 great grand-babies.

Mathematically, this can be represented as 3 (initial children) * 3 (children per child) * 3 (children per grandchild) = 3^3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the amount of money Greta has left after setting aside 50% for her retirement account and 20% for her car payment, we can calculate the amounts as follows:

1. Retirement account: 50% of $2400 = 0.5 * $2400 = $1200
2. Car payment: 20% of $2400 = 0.2 * $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the total amount set aside from her original paycheck:

"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we can calculate the number of pairs by dividing the total number of pencils by 2.

16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard, then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, we can express this as a mathematical expression: 15 × 20.

15 × 20 = 300

Next, we need to find 40% of the total number of fireworks in the city. To do this, we can multiply 300 by 0.4.

300 × 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. There are 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, which can be expressed as 3 × 5.

3 × 5 = 15

Finally, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard to find the total.

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135

The final answer is: 135"
"To determine the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of items purchased and then multiplying that by the cost per item.

Given that each seat can accommodate one person, two drinks, and three snacks, we can establish a ratio of 1:2:3 for people:drinks:snacks. With 19 people in the group, we can calculate the total number of drinks and snacks as follows:

Total number of drinks = 19 * 2 = 38
Total number of snacks = 19 * 3 = 57

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by establishing the capacity of each truck. Let's denote the capacity of Gissela's truck as G, Gordy's truck as Gd, and Gary's truck as Gy.

We are given that G = 4,000 pounds and Gd = G + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds, so we can set up the equation: G + Gd + Gy = 11,600.

Substituting the known values, we get: 4,000 + 4,800 + Gy = 11,600.

Simplifying the equation, we have: 8,800 + Gy = 11,600.

Subtracting 8,800 from both sides, we find: Gy = 2,800.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2,800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the number of dumplings each female ate as 'x'. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, the number of dumplings each male ate can be represented as 'x + 1'.

We are given that there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6x. Similarly, there are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8(x + 1).

Since the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females is equal to the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can set up the equation:

6x + 8(x + 1) = total dumplings

We are also given that each female ate 3 dumplings, so we can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

6(3) + 8(3 + 1) = total dumplings
18 + 8(4) = total dumplings
18 + 32 = total dumplings
50 = total dumplings

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

Final answer: 50"
"To determine the amount of money Gerald has left after spending $10, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of Gerald's and Julia's shares is 3:2, which means that for every 3 parts Gerald has, Julia has 2 parts. The total number of parts is 3 + 2 = 5.

Since Gerald's initial amount is represented by 3 parts, we can calculate his share as (3/5) * 100 = $60. 

Now, we subtract the amount Gerald spent ($10) from his initial amount: $60 - $10 = $50.

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left.

The final answer is $50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that the turtle's speed is 1/5 that of the cat's, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Speed of the turtle = 1/5 × Speed of the cat
Speed of the turtle = 1/5 × 15 feet/second
Speed of the turtle = 3 feet/second

Now, we can calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."

We can set up the equation: 

$\frac{T - 2100}{A} = \frac{6300 - 2100}{700}$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$\frac{4200}{700} = 6$

This means that the firefighters need to fundraise for 6 hours to reach their goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the percentage of water used by the city for industrial purposes. Given that the city utilizes 40% of the river's water and 80% of this amount is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as follows:

Percentage of water used for industrial purposes = 40% * 80% = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 or 32%

Now, to find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 100%:

Percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes = 100% - 32% = 68%

Therefore, the city uses 68% of the Colorado River's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{68}$"

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To calculate the total bill, we can utilize the concept of a weighted average, where each item's cost is multiplied by its quantity and then summed. This approach allows us to accurately account for the varying prices of each item.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
2. 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
3. 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
4. 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

$50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should purchase, we can apply the concept of fractional parts to the deal. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can consider this as a fractional representation of the total cost.

Let's denote the total number of scoops as x. The cost of x scoops is $1.50x. Since Erin has $6.00, we can set up the equation:

$1.50x ≤ $6.00

To find the maximum number of scoops she can buy, we can divide both sides by $1.50:

x ≤ 4

However, since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we need to consider the actual number of scoops she pays for. For every 3 scoops, Erin pays for 2. Therefore, we can divide the total number of scoops by 3 to find the number of ""units"" of the deal:

x/3 ≤ 4/3

Multiplying both sides by 3:

x ≤ 4

Since x must be an integer (you can't buy a fraction of a scoop), the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy is 4. However, considering the deal, she can get 3 scoops for the price of 2. Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the amount of candy each individual has after two weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days. 

Ginger's daily candy consumption is 4 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 4 * 14 = 56 pieces. 

Amy's daily candy consumption is 3 pieces, so her total consumption over 14 days is 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles required to cover two-thirds of Mr. Boarden's 36 square foot bathroom, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to find two-thirds of 36 square feet. This can be calculated as (2/3) * 36. 

Using the distributive property of multiplication over fractions, we can rewrite this expression as 2 * (1/3) * 36. 

Since 1/3 * 36 equals 12, we can simplify the expression to 2 * 12, which equals 24.

Given that Mr. Boarden requires 24 mosaic tiles per square foot, we can multiply 24 by 24 to find the total number of tiles needed.

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"To determine James' savings, we can calculate the cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as the sum of the initial cost and the cost per pound multiplied by the total pounds picked. In this case, the cost is $20 (initial cost) + $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds.

Cost of picking blueberries = $20 + $1.5 * 30
Cost of picking blueberries = $20 + $45
Cost of picking blueberries = $65

The cost of buying blueberries at the store can be calculated as the cost per pound multiplied by the total pounds picked. In this case, the cost is $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds.

Cost of buying blueberries = $2.5 * 30
Cost of buying blueberries = $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65 = $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

$10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we can use the formula for calculating the total cost of a quantity with a price increase.

Let's denote the original price per computer as P and the number of computers as N. The original total cost would be P * N. However, since the price increased by 10%, we need to calculate the new price per computer, which is P + 0.10P = 1.10P.

Given that the original price per computer (P) is $700 and the number of computers (N) is 500, we can calculate the new price per computer as:

New price per computer = $700 + (0.10 * $700) = $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price per computer by the number of computers:

Total amount = New price per computer * N
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

Therefore, the total amount the company paid for the computers is $385,000.

The final answer is: $385,000"

The cost of 6 pencils is 6 * $0.50 = $3.
The cost of 8 erasers is 8 * $0.25 = $2.
The total cost of the items is $3 + $2 = $5.

Since the amount paid was $10, the change received can be calculated as:

Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
Change = $10 - $5
Change = $5

Therefore, the change received is $5."
"To determine the number of people who accept the position, we can break down the process into steps and apply the given percentages.

First, we calculate the number of people who receive interviews: 30% of 100 applicants.

Let's calculate 30% of 100:
30% = 0.3
0.3 * 100 = 30

Next, we find the number of people who receive a job offer from those who received interviews. This is 20% of the 30 people who received interviews.

20% of 30 = 0.2 * 30 = 6

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position, which is one-third of those who received a job offer.

One-third of 6 = 6 / 3 = 2

Therefore, 2 people accept the position.

"To determine the total number of taps Helga performs during her 5-minute dance, we can break down the problem into two distinct periods: when her arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

Let's denote the number of taps per minute for her right foot as R and the number of taps per minute for her left foot as L. When her arms are at her sides, the combined rate is R + L = 550 taps/minute. When her arms are raised, the combined rate is R' + L' = 400 taps/minute.

We are given that she dances for 5 minutes in total, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. Let's calculate the number of taps for each scenario:

1. When her arms are at her sides (3 minutes):
   The number of taps = (R + L) * 3 = 550 * 3 = 1650

2. When her arms are raised (2 minutes):
   The number of taps = (R' + L') * 2 = 400 * 2 = 800

The total number of taps is the sum of the taps in both scenarios:
Total taps = 1650 + 800 = 2450

Therefore, Helga performs a total of 2450 taps during her 5-minute dance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To determine the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole can be calculated as the sum of the damage to the car ($450) and the additional costs incurred, which include the fine ($120) and the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt (3 * $25 = $75). Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $450 + $120 + $75 = $645.

The cost of not fixing the pothole is simply the damage to the car, which is $450.

To find the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the cost of not fixing the pothole from the total cost of fixing the pothole: $645 - $450 = $195.

Therefore, Ron saves $195 by fixing the pothole himself.

"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we can break down the problem into two parts: the slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends, and the slices eaten by the remaining two friends.

First, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Since they ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and each pizza has 12 slices, we can express this as:

(2/3) × 12 = 8 slices

Next, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. They ate ¾ of their pizzas, which can be expressed as:

(3/4) × 12 = 9 slices

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups to find the total number of slices eaten:

8 + 9 = 17 slices

Since there were 5 pizzas in total, the number of slices left can be found by subtracting the total slices eaten from the total number of slices:

5 × 12 - 17 = 25

Therefore, the number of slices left is 25.

The final answer is 25."
"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can employ the concept of weighted averages. 

Let's denote the time taken by the cat as C and the time taken by the dog as D. We are given that the dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we can express this as:

D = (2/3)C

We are also given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

D = (2/3)(30)
D = 20 minutes

Now, we can calculate the average time taken by both the cat and the dog:

Average time = (C + D) / 2
= (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as an equation:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

9x = 90

Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of windows smashed, we can calculate the number of windows smashed by students and teachers separately and then sum them up.

Let's denote the total number of students' cars as S and the total number of teachers' cars as T. We are given that S = 64 and T = 32.

The number of windows smashed by students is 3/4 of the total number of students' cars, which can be expressed as (3/4)S. Similarly, the number of windows smashed by teachers is 3/4 of the total number of teachers' cars, which can be expressed as (3/4)T.

The total number of windows smashed is the sum of the windows smashed by students and teachers, which can be represented as:

Total windows smashed = (3/4)S + (3/4)T

Substituting the given values, we get:

Next, we calculate the total number of spools: 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of blue spools: (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into two parts. First, we calculate the number of people who voted by midday, which is 2/5 of the total number of people.

Let's calculate the number of people who voted by midday:
(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

Next, we need to find the number of people remaining after midday. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of people who voted from the total number of people:
5000 - 2000 = 3000

Now, we are given that 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00. To find the number of people who voted by 16:00, we multiply the number of remaining people by 2/3:
(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

Finally, to find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the total number of people:
5000 - 2000 = 3000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 3000.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can employ a simple division operation. 

Let's denote the number of days Parker wants the gum to last as 'd' and the number of pieces of gum per pack as 'p'. We are given that d = 30 days and p = 15 pieces per pack. 

The total number of pieces of gum Parker will consume in 'd' days is given by the product of 'd' and 'p'. To find the number of packs required, we divide this total by 'p'. 

Number of packs = (d * p) / p = d

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of packs = 30 days

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

Therefore, Parker will need 31 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final answer is: 31"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers required, we can calculate the total number of smores needed and then divide it by the number of smores per box.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed. We have 9 kids and 6 adults, with each kid requiring 2 smores and each adult requiring 1 s'more. The total number of smores needed is:

9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores needed by 8 to find the number of sleeves required:

24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we can conclude that 3 boxes of graham crackers are required.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Dora's age as 'D', her father's age as 'F', and her mother's age as 'M'. We are given the following information:

1. Dora's age, D = 15 years.
2. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age: F = 2D + 8.
3. Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father: M = F - 4.

Substituting the value of D into the equation for F, we get:
F = 2(15) + 8
F = 30 + 8
F = 38 years.

Now, substituting the value of F into the equation for M, we get:
M = 38 - 4
M = 34 years.

Finally, we can calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Combined age = D + F + M

= 87 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can utilize the concept of division. In this scenario, we have a total of $20 and 4 siblings. 

The amount each sibling receives can be calculated by dividing the total amount of money ($20) by the number of siblings (4).

$20 ÷ 4 = $5

Therefore, each sibling received $5."
"To determine the total weight of Cindy's books, we can utilize the principle of additive weight. Given the weights of each book, we can calculate the total weight by summing the individual weights.

The weights of Cindy's books are as follows:
- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, so 2 x 2 = 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can start by calculating the number of votes candidate B received. Since candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A, we can express this as:

Votes for B = Votes for A + (50% of Votes for A)
Votes for B = 0.2 * 100 + (0.5 * 0.2 * 100)
Votes for B = 20 + 10
Votes for B = 30

Now, we can find the number of votes candidate C received by subtracting the total votes received by candidates A and B from the total number of voters:

Votes for C = Total votes - (Votes for A + Votes for B)
Votes for C = 100 - (20 + 30)
Votes for C = 100 - 50
Votes for C = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of apples Boris initially has as B and the number of apples Beck has as K. We are given that B = 100 and K = B - 23. 

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, the new number of apples Beck has becomes K + 10, and the new number of apples Boris has becomes B - 10. We are asked to find the difference between the new amounts, which can be expressed as (B - 10) - (K + 10).

Substituting the given values, we get (100 - 10) - ((100 - 23) + 10) = 90 - (77 + 10) = 90 - 87 = 3.

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transaction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the amount of water left, we can calculate the total water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's calculate the total water used for each type of cube:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'x'. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can express Clara's total as 2x.

We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation 2x = 20 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get:

2x = 20
x = 20 / 2
x = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find Alice's total by adding 6 to Steven's total:

Alice's total = 10 + 6
Alice's total = 16

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract Alice's total from Clara's total:

Clara's total - Alice's total = 20 - 16
Clara's total - Alice's total = 4

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the 10-gallon jars and the cost of the 16 half-gallon jars.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can multiply this cost by 10 to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the 16 half-gallon jars. Since a half-gallon jar costs $3, we can multiply this cost by 16 to find the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the 10-gallon jars and the cost of the 16 half-gallon jars.

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as N, the number of students who like to bake as B, the number of students who like to play basketball as K, and the number of students who like to play video games as V.

Given:
N = 50
B = 10
K = 5

We are also told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as M. Therefore, M = 2K = 2(5) = 10.

Since the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball (or both) is B + K - (number of students who like both), we can calculate the number of students who like to play video games or play music as N - (B + K - (number of students who like both)). However, we do not have the number of students who like both. 

Fortunately, we can infer that the number of students who like both is not relevant to the problem, as we are only interested in the number of students who like to play video games. 

We know that the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is N - (B + K) = 50 - (10 + 5) = 35.

Since we know that M = 10, the number of students who like to play video games is V = 35 - M = 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we need to find the number of birds that were scared away. Since 1/3 of the initial 12 birds were scared away, we can calculate this as:

Number of birds scared away = (1/3) × 12
= 12/3
= 4

Next, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds to find the number of birds remaining:

Number of birds remaining = Initial number of birds - Number of birds scared away
= 12 - 4
= 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard, so we add this to the number of birds remaining:

Total number of birds = Number of birds remaining + Number of birds that joined
= 8 + 20
= 28

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can employ a straightforward approach. Given that the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each class by dividing the total number of students by 2.

Let's denote the number of students in each class as x. We can set up the equation:

2x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Now that we know each class has 40 students, we can calculate the number of girls in each class. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can find the number of girls by multiplying 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

Number of boys in each class = Total number of students in each class - Number of girls in each class
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

Initially, Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on the plate. She then adds 3 more slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, she triples the number of slices, which can be represented as 5 * 3 = 15 slices. 

After tripling the number of slices, Mara eats 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices. 

Finally, her friend steals 5 slices, reducing the number of slices to 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the number of animals Melissa will groom each day, we can utilize the concept of division to allocate the total number of animals evenly across the 7 days of the week.

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)
Total number of animals = 28

Divide the total number of animals by 7 (days in a week):
28 ÷ 7 = 4

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4."
"To calculate Mark's profit, we must first determine the total cost of the packs and the total value of the cards. The total cost of the packs can be found by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack:

Total Cost = Number of Packs * Cost per Pack
Total Cost = 3 packs * $1800 per pack
Total Cost = $5400

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards Mark found. This includes the two cards worth $4000 and $1000, as well as the 30 cards worth $50 each. We can express this as:

Total Value = Value of Card 1 + Value of Card 2 + (Number of Cards * Value per Card)
Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50)
Total Value = $4000 + $1000 + $1500
Total Value = $6500

Finally, we can find Mark's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value:

Profit = Total Value - Total Cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400
Profit = $1100

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we can calculate the total cost of each option and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of adults as A and the number of children as C. The cost of the first amusement park can be represented as 26A + 12C, and the cost of the second amusement park can be represented as 14A + 10C.

Given that A = 2 and C = 2, we can substitute these values into the equations:

Cost of the first amusement park: 26A + 12C = 26(2) + 12(2) = 52 + 24 = 76
Cost of the second amusement park: 14A + 10C = 14(2) + 10(2) = 28 + 20 = 48

To find the cost savings, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first:
76 - 48 = 28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

The final answer is: $28"
"To determine the vendor's weekly savings, we can calculate the difference in daily costs between the two vendors and then multiply by 7.

The vendor's daily cost savings can be found by subtracting the cost of the new vendor from the cost of the old vendor:

$250 (old vendor) - $200 (new vendor) = $50 per day

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

$50 per day * 7 days per week = $350 per week

Therefore, the vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor.

The final answer is: $350"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of marbles each individual has. Let's denote the number of marbles Sean has as S, the number of marbles Carl has as C, and the number of marbles Cal has as K.

We are given that Sean has 56 marbles, so S = 56.

We are also given that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which can be expressed as S = 0.5K. Substituting S = 56 into this equation, we can solve for K:

56 = 0.5K
K = 56 / 0.5
K = 112

Now that we know Cal has 112 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying Sean's marbles by 4, as given in the problem:

C = 4S
C = 4(56)
C = 224

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their individual totals:

Total = C + K
Total = 224 + 112
Total = 336

The final answer is: $\boxed{336}$"
"To determine the number of additional groups needed, we must first clarify the objective. If the activity requires 6 groups, we can calculate the number of students per group as follows:

Number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups
= 54 students / 6 groups
= 9 students per group

Since the question asks for the number of additional groups needed, we can calculate the total number of groups required to accommodate 54 students as follows:

Total number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
= 54 students / 9 students per group
= 6 groups

However, the question states that 12 groups are already required. To find the number of additional groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already required from the total number of groups needed:

Number of additional groups needed = Total number of groups needed - Number of groups already required
= 6 groups - 12 groups
= -6 groups

Since the number of groups cannot be negative, we must re-evaluate the calculation. The correct approach is to find the difference between the number of students and the number of groups already required:

Number of additional groups needed = (Total number of students - Number of students in existing groups) / Number of students per group
= (54 students - 72 students) / 9 students per group
= -18 students / 9 students per group
= -2 groups

However, this calculation is incorrect, as we cannot have a negative number of groups. The correct approach is to find the difference between the number of students and the number of groups already required, and then divide by the number of students per group:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately.

Let's break down the calculation:

Weekdays: 
There are 5 weekdays in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekdays in 4 weeks is 5 * 4 = 20.
Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in 4 weeks is 20 * 60 = 1200.

Weekends: 
There are 2 weekend days in a week, and 4 weeks in a month. 
So, the total number of weekend days in 4 weeks is 2 * 4 = 8.
Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in 4 weeks is 8 * 100 = 800.

Total chairs rented in 4 weeks = 1200 + 800 = 2000.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out 2000 chairs in two 4-week months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile, we can analyze the sequence of events that affected the banana count.

Initially, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas, reducing the count to 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Next, Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile, resulting in a total of 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. However, Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, on the third day, Gunther added 6 bananas to his pile, bringing the total count to 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the yearly electricity bill per roommate, we can utilize the concept of proportional sharing. Given that the monthly electricity bill is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we can calculate the monthly share per roommate as follows:

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

To find the yearly share, we can multiply the monthly share by 12:

Yearly share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $25 * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity, assuming the monthly bill remains constant and the roommates divide the share equally."
"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we can calculate the initial quantities and then subtract the number of broken items.

Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses, which is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. Similarly, he sent 4 dozen plates, which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

When the items were returned, 10 glasses were broken, and 6 plates were also broken. To find the remaining number of glasses, we subtract the number of broken glasses from the initial quantity: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.

To find the remaining number of plates, we subtract the number of broken plates from the initial quantity: 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{128}$"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we can break down the transactions into two separate steps.

First, we calculate the number of small stickers she trades for large buttons. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and she trades 90% of her small stickers, we can express this as:

Number of small stickers traded = 0.9 * 30 = 27

This leaves her with 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers.

Next, we calculate the number of large stickers she trades for large buttons. Since she trades 50% of her large stickers, we can express this as:

Number of large stickers traded = 0.5 * 40 = 20

This leaves her with 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.

Now, she trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons. Since each large button is worth three small stickers, we can express this as:

Number of small stickers received = 20 * 3 = 60

Adding the small stickers she already had to the ones she received, we get:

Total small stickers = 3 + 60 = 63

Finally, we add the number of large stickers she has left to the total number of small stickers:

Total buttons = 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83

The final answer is 83."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in a week, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we establish the number of matches played on each day: 
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 2 times the number of matches played on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 matches

Now, we can calculate the total number of matches played in a week by summing the matches played on each day: 
Total matches = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 11

Now that we have determined the number of votes against the regulation, we can calculate the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Final answer: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we can utilize a systematic approach to calculate the number of students for each size, taking into account the given relationships between the sizes.

Let's denote the number of students for each size as follows:
- Extra-small: x
- Small: 2x
- Medium: 2x - 4
- Large: (2x - 4) / 2
- Extra-large: ((2x - 4) / 2) + 6

We are given that the number of extra-small students is 11, so we can set up the equation:
x = 11

Now, we can calculate the number of students for each size:
- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 2 * 11 = 22
- Medium: 2 * 11 - 4 = 18
- Large: (2 * 11 - 4) / 2 = 9
- Extra-large: (2 * 11 - 4) / 2 + 6 = 15

To find the total number of shirts, we add the number of students for each size:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts."
"To calculate the final price after a 5% discount on an item marked at $140, we can apply the formula:

Final Price = Marked Price - (Marked Price * Discount Percentage)

In this case, the marked price is $140 and the discount percentage is 5%, which as a decimal is 0.05.

Final Price = 140 - (140 * 0.05)
Final Price = 140 - 7
Final Price = 133

Therefore, the final price after the discount is $133."
"To determine the total duration of the playlists, we can employ the fundamental principles of arithmetic. Given that each playlist consists of 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours long, we can calculate the total duration by multiplying the number of playlists by the number of songs per playlist and then by the duration of each song.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total duration = Number of playlists × Number of songs per playlist × Duration of each song
Total duration = 20 × 300 × 10

Using the rules of multiplication, we can simplify this expression:

Total duration = 20 × 3000
Total duration = 60,000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last for 60,000 hours in total.

The final answer is: 60,000"
"To determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win, which is 20% of 50 people. This can be expressed as 0.2 * 50 = 10 people.

Next, we find the number of people who think horse #7 will win. Since 10 people think horse #2 will win, there are 50 - 10 = 40 people remaining. Then, we calculate 60% of 40, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 people.

The remaining people who think horse #12 will win can be found by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people. Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach using algebra. Let's denote the total number of puppies as 'x'. Since two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can express this as an equation:

(2/3)x = 6

To isolate 'x', we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (2/3), which is (3/2):

x = 6 * (3/2)

x = 9

Therefore, Jana has 9 puppies in total.

The final answer is 9."
"To determine the amount Jayden needs to purchase the camera, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Jayden initially has as 'x' and the amount Ava gives him as 'y'. We know that Jayden's initial amount is $70, so x = $70. We also know that Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which can be expressed as y = $90 / 2 = $45.

The total amount Jayden has after receiving the money from Ava is the sum of the initial amount and the amount Ava gave him, which is x + y = $70 + $45 = $115. The cost of the camera is $200, so the amount Jayden needs is the difference between the cost of the camera and the total amount he has: $200 - $115 = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 to buy the camera."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles required for the third house, we can start by calculating the amount needed for the first house. Since the first house requires half of the total 250 cases, we can express this as:

Number of cases for the first house = Total cases / 2
= 250 / 2
= 125 cases

Now, we are told that the third house requires double the amount of the first house. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cases needed for the third house as:

Number of cases for the third house = 2 * Number of cases for the first house
= 2 * 125
= 250 cases

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we can calculate the individual costs and sum them up.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so her total expenditure is 3 × $2 = $6.

Jack purchases 5 tomatoes at $1 each, resulting in a total cost of 5 × $1 = $5.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3.

The total amount spent is the sum of these individual costs: $6 + $5 + $3 = $14.

Therefore, the total cost of the items purchased is $14."
"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we can utilize the concept of percentages and basic arithmetic operations.

Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can express this relationship as:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + (45% of Number of bananas)

Let's denote the number of bananas as B. Then, the number of pears can be represented as B + 0.45B = 1.45B.

We are given that George has 200 bananas, so B = 200. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

Number of pears = 1.45B = 1.45 * 200 = 290

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
= 200 + 290
= 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

The final answer is: 490"
"To determine the number of candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candy bars as 'x'. Since each candy bar costs $5, the total cost of the candy bars can be represented as 5x. We know that Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on the ball, so the remaining amount of money is $60. This can be expressed as:

5x = 60

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 60 ÷ 5
x = 12

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information. 

First, we need to establish the cost per liter of juice. Since Sam requires 5 kilograms of oranges to produce 1 liter of juice, and each kilogram costs $3, the cost per liter can be calculated as follows:

Cost per liter = (Cost per kilogram) * (Number of kilograms per liter)
= $3 * 5
= $15 per liter

Now, to find the total cost of producing 4 liters of juice, we can multiply the cost per liter by the desired quantity:

Total cost = Cost per liter * Quantity
= $15 * 4
= $60

Therefore, Sam would need to spend $60 to produce 4 liters of juice.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's break down the information provided:

Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. We know that Ezra read a total of 300 books in that hour, and then he decided to read 150 more. To find the initial number of books Ahmed read, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let x be the number of books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can express this relationship as:

2x = 300 (initial books read by Ezra)

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 300 / 2
x = 150

This indicates that Ahmed read 150 books initially. To find the total number of books read by Ahmed, we can add the additional 150 books Ezra read:

Total books read by Ahmed = 150 (initial) + 150 (additional) = 300

Now, we can find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:

Total books read = Ezra's total books + Ahmed's total books
= 300 (Ezra's initial) + 300 (Ezra's additional) + 150 (Ahmed's initial)
= 300 + 300 + 150
= 750

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we can calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings for Monday. Since she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, her total earnings for Monday can be calculated as:

4 classes * 5 hours * $15 per hour = $60

Next, we need to check if she earns the daily bonus for teaching more than 3 classes. Since she teaches 4 classes on Monday, she indeed earns the bonus. The bonus amount is $5 per day, so we add this to her earnings:

$60 + $5 = $65

Now, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday. She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours, so her total earnings for Wednesday can be calculated as:

2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

Again, she earns the daily bonus for teaching more than 3 classes, which is $5 per day. We add this to her earnings:

$30 + $5 = $35

Finally, we sum up her earnings for both days to find her total earnings:

$65 + $35 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

Let's denote the number of vanilla scents sold as V and the number of fruity scents sold as F. We are given that the company sold 5 of each vanilla scent and 2 of each fruity scent. Therefore, we can express the number of vanilla scents sold as V = 5 * 4 = 20, and the number of fruity scents sold as F = 2 * 8 = 16.

To find the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold: V - F = 20 - 16 = 4.

Therefore, the company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the selling price of each ear of corn, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the selling price of each ear of corn as 'x'. Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135, and he has already made $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each, we can set up the following equation:

20(3) + 25x = 135

Simplifying the equation, we get:
60 + 25x = 135

Subtracting 60 from both sides:
25x = 75

Dividing both sides by 25:
x = 3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we calculate the total available time for leisure activities, which is the sum of the time spent on Saturday and Sunday. This yields 7 hours for Saturday and 5 hours for Sunday, resulting in a total of 12 hours.

Next, we need to account for the time spent reading, which is given as 3 hours. Subtracting this from the total available time leaves us with 12 - 3 = 9 hours for other activities.

Since Tatiana spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games, we can calculate this as (1/3) * 9 = 3 hours. 

Now, we can find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total available time: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To express this as a percentage of the total weekend time, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50\%}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. This can be calculated as:

Number of pencils remaining after giving 1/2 to Brandon = Total pencils - (1/2 * Total pencils)
= 50 - (1/2 * 50)
= 50 - 25
= 25

Next, we need to find the number of pencils remaining after Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. This can be calculated as:

Number of pencils remaining after giving 3/5 to Charlie = (Number of pencils remaining after giving 1/2 to Brandon) - (3/5 * Number of pencils remaining after giving 1/2 to Brandon)
= 25 - (3/5 * 25)
= 25 - 15
= 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we can employ the concept of round-trip travel time. Given that Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 miles per hour (mph) and spends 6 hours at the museum, we can calculate the total time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed

First, we calculate the one-way travel time:
Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we must double the one-way travel time to account for the return journey:
Total travel time = 2 hours * 2
Total travel time = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Total travel time + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left in the box after Henry assembles the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles.

Let's denote the number of cars as C and the number of motorcycles as M. We are given that C = 57 and M = 73. The number of wheels required for the cars is 4C, and the number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 2M.

Total number of wheels required = 4C + 2M
= 4(57) + 2(73)
= 228 + 146
= 374

Now, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the initial number of wheels in the box: 650 - 374 = 276

Therefore, the number of wheels left in the box is 276.

The final answer is: $\boxed{276}$"
"To calculate the discounted price of the laptop, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease. The formula for finding the amount of the discount is:

Discount = (Percentage / 100) * Original Price

In this case, the original price of the laptop is $1000, and the discount is 20%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Discount = (20 / 100) * $1000
= 0.20 * $1000
= $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price:

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
= $1000 - $200
= $800

Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is $800."
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
= 600 / 3
= 200

The cost of the series can be calculated by multiplying the number of movies in series by the cost of a normal movie and then dividing by 3, as Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie.

Cost of series = (Number of movies in series * $10) / 3
= ($200 * $10) / 3
= $2000 / 3
= $666.67

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
= 600 - 200
= 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
= 400 * 0.4
= 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
= 160 * $5
= $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
= 400 - 160
= 240

The cost of the normal movies is:

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
= 240 * $10
= $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
= $666.67 + $800 + $2400
= $3566.67

The final answer is: $3566.67"
"To determine the total cost of the fruit, we can apply the concept of weighted averages. Let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit:

Peaches: 6 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $12.00
Plums: 8 pounds * $1.00 per pound = $8.00
Apricots: 6 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $18.00

To find the total cost, we can sum the individual costs:

Total Cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total Cost = $38.00

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can employ the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the driving speed as 'd' and the hiking speed as 'h'. We are given that the driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so d = 50.

The problem states that the hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Therefore, we can express the hiking speed as h = (d/2) - 5.

We are also given that the time spent hiking is 1.5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can set up an equation:

h * 1.5 = d * t

where 't' is the time spent driving. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can express 't' as t = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

Substituting the values of 'h' and 't' into the equation, we get:

((d/2) - 5) * 1.5 = d * 4.5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(50/2) - 5) * 1.5 = 50 * 4.5
(25 - 5) * 1.5 = 50 * 4.5
20 * 1.5 = 50 * 4.5
30 = 225

However, this equation is not solvable, as it results in a contradiction. This indicates that the given information is inconsistent. 

Since the given information is inconsistent, we cannot determine the exact distance to the vacation spot.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{N/A}$"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can analyze their individual performance metrics.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A. We are given the following information:

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so Ava's enemy count is 8 + 0 = 8.
2. Emma collects 3 more berries than Ava, so Emma's berry count is 3 + 5 = 8.
3. Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so Ava's time is 30 + 4 = 34 seconds.

We can calculate their scores using the given point values:

Ava's score: 8 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 34 * 30 (for time) = 80 + 40 + 1020 = 1140

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1140 - 820 = 320.

The final answer is: $\boxed{320}$"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas as 'x'. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation yields:

2x = 34

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas costs 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of times they ride on usual days and the number of times they ride on the extra days.

Let's denote the number of times they ride on usual days as 'u' and the number of times they ride on extra days as 'e'. We are given that they ride 3 times a day on usual days for 5 days, so we can express this as 3u = 3 * 5 = 15. On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which can be expressed as 2 * 3 * 2 = 12.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week: u + e = 27.

Since we know that 3u = 15, we can solve for 'u' by dividing both sides by 3: u = 15 / 3 = 5.

Substituting the value of 'u' into the equation u + e = 27, we get 5 + e = 27. Solving for 'e', we subtract 5 from both sides: e = 27 - 5 = 22.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as x.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After the sales assistant took out 17 fish, the number of orange fish became 3 - 14 = -11 (this is not possible, so we will assume the assistant took out 3 orange fish and 14 white fish, or 14 orange fish and 3 white fish, but we will use the first option for the solution).

Let's use the first option: 3 orange fish were taken out, and 14 white fish were taken out.

Now, Bob has 3 - 3 = 0 orange fish and 4 - 14 = -10 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

"To determine the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car, we can employ the concept of average daily distance traveled and the given fuel efficiency. Since Andy commutes to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week can be calculated as follows:

Total weekly distance = Daily round-trip distance × Number of working days
= 2 × 5 miles/day × 5 days
= 50 miles

Given that the fuel efficiency of Andy's car is 10 miles per gallon (MPG), we can calculate the amount of fuel consumed per week:

Fuel consumption (gallons) = Total weekly distance ÷ Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles ÷ 10 MPG
= 5 gallons

To determine the weekly fuel cost, we can multiply the fuel consumption by the current price of regular gas, which is $3 per gallon:

Weekly fuel cost = Fuel consumption (gallons) × Price per gallon
= 5 gallons × $3/gallon
= $15

Therefore, Andy's car consumes $15 worth of fuel per week."
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to consider the amount she spent on the twenties and the quarters separately.

First, let's calculate the amount she spent on the twenties. Carrie had 10 twenties and spent 3/5 of them. This can be represented as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount spent on twenties is 6 * 20 = $120.

Next, we need to calculate the amount she spent on the quarters. Carrie had 140 quarters and spent all of them. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount spent on quarters is 140 * 0.25 = $35.

Now, we can find the total amount she paid for lunch by adding the amount spent on twenties and the amount spent on quarters: $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"
"To determine the total number of fruits, we can utilize the concept of linear multiplication. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, each yielding 22 tomatoes, and 8 eggplant plants, each yielding 4 eggplants.

The total number of tomatoes can be calculated as 5 * 22, and the total number of eggplants can be calculated as 8 * 4. By adding these two values together, we can obtain the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = (5 * 22) + (8 * 4)
= 110 + 32
= 142

Therefore, Ricardo can expect to obtain 142 fruits from his plants.

The final answer is: 142"
"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we can utilize the concept of complementary fractions. Given that one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs, we can calculate the combined fraction of non-OLED TVs as follows:

1/4 (smart TVs) + 1/8 (analog TVs) = 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can set up an equation to find the number of OLED TVs:

Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
= 40 - (10 + 5)
= 40 - 15
= 25

Alternatively, we can express this calculation as a fraction of the total:

Number of OLED TVs = 1 - (1/4 + 1/8)
= 1 - (2/8 + 1/8)
= 1 - 3/8
= 5/8 * 40
= 25

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the amount of money John is missing, we can calculate the difference between the total cost of the trip and the amount he has. 

The total cost of the trip is $300, and the school is covering half of this cost. Therefore, John needs to cover the remaining half, which is $300 / 2 = $150.

Since John has $50, we can calculate the amount he is missing by subtracting this from the total amount he needs to cover: $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. The key concept here is to calculate the total temperature difference between the day and night, and then divide that by the heating capacity of a single log.

Given that the temperature during the day is 45 degrees and the temperature at night is 33 degrees, the temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.

Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the required number of logs as follows:

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heating capacity per log
= 12 / 5
= 2.4

To ensure the house remains warm enough, we must round up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot burn a fraction of a log. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we first need to calculate the number of groups and then multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

Given that 90 people were divided into 9-person groups, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups that contributed as:

Number of contributing groups = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

As each group brought back 2 seashells, the total number of seashells collected is:

Total seashells = Number of contributing groups * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train after the sequence of events, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, resulting in 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, increasing the total to 125 + 13 = 138. Finally, at the next stop, 38 people get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"To calculate the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we multiply the number of bottle caps collected per day (10) by the number of days in the month (30) to determine the total number of bottle caps collected:

10 bottle caps/day × 30 days = 300 bottle caps

Next, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each cap ($0.25):

300 bottle caps × $0.25/bottle cap = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine Jamie's total earnings for the day, we can break down her compensation into two components: her regular hourly wage and the special hourly rate for additional hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular 8 hours of work. Her regular hourly wage is $20 per hour, so her earnings for 8 hours are:

8 hours × $20/hour = $160

Next, we need to calculate her earnings for the additional 3 hours. Her special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate, which can be expressed as:

$20/hour × 1.5 = $30/hour

For the additional 3 hours, her earnings are:

3 hours × $30/hour = $90

Now, we can find her total earnings for the day by adding her earnings for the regular hours and the additional hours:

$160 + $90 = $250

Therefore, Jamie's total earnings for the day are $250."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. Given that there are 12 female lions and half as many male lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = 12 / 2 = 6

Next, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we can apply the concept of percentage discount to the original price of the jeans.

Given that the original price of the jeans is $40 and the discount is 25%, we can calculate the discounted price as follows:

Discount amount = 25% of $40 = 0.25 × $40 = $10

Discounted price = Original price - Discount amount = $40 - $10 = $30

Now, we can calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after paying with a $50 bill:

Amount left over = $50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the discounted jeans."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. The initial number of employees is 200, and the company hires 20 new employees every month. This represents an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20.

The total number of employees after three months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, the first term (a1) is 200, and the last term (an) can be calculated as follows:

an = a1 + (n-1)d
an = 200 + (3-1)20
an = 200 + 40
an = 240

Now, we can calculate the sum of the series:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)
S = 3/2 * (200 + 240)
S = 1.5 * 440
S = 660

However, this represents the total number of employees, not the total salary paid. To calculate the total salary paid, we multiply the total number of employees by the salary per employee:

Total salary paid = Total number of employees * Salary per employee
Total salary paid = 660 * $4000
Total salary paid = $2,640,000

The final answer is: $2,640,000"
"To determine the total caroling time, we can utilize the concept of addition. The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, which has a duration of 150 seconds each time. Therefore, the total time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"" is 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.

Additionally, they will be singing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which has a duration of 240 seconds. To find the total caroling time, we need to add the time spent singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"": 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

The total caroling time is 540 seconds.

Final answer: 540"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial hourly wage was $10. After a $0.50 per hour raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50. Following another $1.00 per hour raise, his wage increased to $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. 

Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Billy's total earnings = 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings = 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

The difference in their earnings can be found by subtracting Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To determine the cost difference between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 × $2 = $6.

The cost of 2 bagels is 2 × $1 = $2.

Now, we can find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To determine the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we can start by calculating Nikita's score. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can express this as:

Nikita's score = (Pierson's score / 2) + 11

Given that Pierson scored 278 points, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Nikita's score = (278 / 2) + 11
Nikita's score = 139 + 11
Nikita's score = 150

Now, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores:

Total score = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total score = 278 + 150
Total score = 428

Therefore, the total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428.

The final answer is: $\boxed{428}$"
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we can calculate the number of trees planted by students and teachers separately and then sum them up.

Let's start by calculating the number of trees planted by students. With 40 classes and an average of 25 students per class, the total number of students is 40 * 25 = 1000. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is also 1000.

Next, we calculate the number of trees planted by teachers. There are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we can start by finding the total number of stuffed animals she currently has. This can be calculated by adding the number of each type of stuffed animal:

3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7

x = 0.2857

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming time into two distinct periods. 

First, we calculate the total hours she played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks, and she plays for 0.5 hours per day, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours she played in the last week. With 7 days in a week and 2 hours of playtime per day, the total hours played in the last week is 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours played is the sum of the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week, which is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, we subtract 21 from 30 to find the remaining hours needed: 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since both cars are traveling at constant speeds, we can use the formula for relative motion:

Distance = (v2 - v1) * t

where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two cars, and t is the time.

Given that v1 = 60 mph and v2 = 70 mph, and t = 2 hours, we can plug in these values into the formula:

Distance = (70 - 60) * 2
Distance = 10 * 2
Distance = 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total cost of the ring, we need to calculate the premium and add it to the cost of the diamond and gold. The premium is 30% of the total cost of the ring.

Let's denote the total cost of the ring as C. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is the sum of the cost of the diamond and the cost of the gold, which is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost, which can be calculated as 0.3 * $900. This equals $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break down the information provided:

- Third-graders who passed: 340
- Fourth-graders who passed: 40
- Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80 (since their pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders)

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate using the formula: (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

Therefore, the overall pass rate is 46%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46}$"
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we can start by calculating the total number of square inches that Milo can create with the available glass chips. Since it takes 12 chips to form every square inch, we can find the total area by multiplying the number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'b', the number of chips per bag as 'c', and the number of chips per square inch as 's'. We are given that b = 2 and c = 72.

Total number of chips = b * c = 2 * 72 = 144

Now, we can find the total area by dividing the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Total area = Total number of chips / s = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Length = Total area / Height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we must first calculate the total amount consumed. 

Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so the total amount they consumed is 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. 
Sixteen students drank 2 quarts each, so the total amount they consumed is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we can employ a straightforward approach. Initially, Dale had 100 candies and sold 150, resulting in a net loss of 50 candies. However, this is an unrealistic scenario, as it implies a negative quantity. A more plausible interpretation is that Dale initially had 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, bringing his total to 200 candies. After selling 150, he is left with 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

To find the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we can subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he has. This can be represented as:

Total candies = 200
Candies sold = 150
Candies remaining = 200 - 150 = 50

Candies still needed to be sold = Total candies - Candies remaining
= 200 - 50
= 150

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 candies to sell all of his candy.

Final answer: 150"
"To determine the number of additional students who would have joined by the end of May, we can model the growth of the student population using exponential growth. Given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can express this as a geometric sequence.

Let's denote the initial number of students as P0 = 10. The common ratio (r) for this sequence is 2, since the number of students doubles each month. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:

An = P0 * r^(n-1)

We want to find the number of students at the end of May, which is the 5th term (since January is the 1st term). Plugging in the values, we get:

A5 = 10 * 2^(5-1)
A5 = 10 * 2^4
A5 = 10 * 16
A5 = 160

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from the total number of students at the end of May:

Additional students = A5 - P0
= 160 - 10
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we can employ a straightforward division operation. Given that Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can then calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we can employ a systematic approach to account for the varying numbers of petals on each type of flower.

Let's first calculate the total number of petals Rose picked:

Total petals = (3 flowers * 5 petals) + (4 flowers * 6 petals) + (5 flowers * 4 petals) + (6 flowers * 7 petals)
Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
Total petals = 101

However, Rose dropped 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract the total number of petals she dropped:

Total petals dropped = (1 flower * 5 petals) + (1 flower * 6 petals) + (1 flower * 4 petals) + (1 flower * 7 petals)
Total petals dropped = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7
Total petals dropped = 22

Now, we can find the total number of petals in the vase by subtracting the total petals dropped from the total petals picked:

Total petals in vase = Total petals - Total petals dropped
Total petals in vase = 101 - 22
Total petals in vase = 79

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to consider the total number of marshmallows available and the number of S'mores already made.

Let's denote the total number of marshmallows as M, the number of S'mores made by John as J, and the number of S'mores made by DeSean as D. We are given that M = 35, J = 9, and D = 9.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of marshmallows used is equal to the total number of S'mores made, which is J + D = 9 + 9 = 18.

To find the number of marshmallows remaining, we subtract the number of marshmallows used from the total number of marshmallows: M - (J + D) = 35 - 18 = 17.

Now, we can determine the number of S'mores each kid can have by dividing the remaining marshmallows by 2, since each S'more requires one marshmallow. This can be represented as (M - (J + D)) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5.

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a S'more, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each kid can have 8 S'mores.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total amount of money used, we can calculate the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's denote the time Jack plays as t1, the time his friend plays as t2, and the time the better friend plays as t3. We know that t1 = 240 minutes, t2 = 120 minutes, and t3 = 1.5t1 = 360 minutes.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. We can set up the equation: t1 + t2 + t3 = 240.

Substituting the values, we get: 240 + 120 + 360 = 720 minutes. However, this is the total time played, not the sum of the individual times. Since the problem states that the friends play for 4 hours, we can assume that the total time played is actually 240 minutes, and the equation becomes: t1 + t2 + t3 = 240.

Now, we can solve for t3: t3 = 240 - t1 - t2 = 240 - 240 - 120 = 0 minutes. However, this is not possible since t3 is significantly better than Jack. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since the friends play for 4 hours, we can assume that the total time played is 240 minutes. We can set up the equation: t1 + t2 + t3 = 240.

We know that t2 = 120 minutes and t3 = 1.5t1. Substituting these values, we get: t1 + 120 + 1.5t1 = 240.

Combine like terms: 2.5t1 = 120.

Divide both sides by 2.5: t1 = 48 minutes.

Now that we have t1, we can find t3: t3 = 1.5t1 = 1.5 * 48 = 72 minutes.

We can now calculate the number of quarters used by each person: Jack uses 48 / 20 = 2.4 quarters, his friend uses 120 / 20 = 6 quarters, and the better friend uses 72 / 20 = 3.6 quarters.

Since we can't buy a fraction of a quarter, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Jack uses 3 quarters, his friend uses 6 quarters, and the better friend uses 4 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 13 * $0.25 = $3.25.

The final answer is: $3.25"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can analyze the given information and apply basic algebraic techniques.

Let's denote the amount of salt used as x ounces. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is also x ounces. Given that she uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total amount of money John spent, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats: 3 goats × $500 per goat = $1500.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows: 2 cows × $1500 per cow = $3000.

Finally, we add the costs of the goats and cows to find the total amount spent: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

The final answer is: $4500"
"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to purchase, we can employ a simple subtraction method. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul already has: 8 (chocolate) + 40 (toffee) = 48 cupcakes.

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed: 63 - 48 = 15.

Therefore, Paul needs to purchase 15 more cupcakes to meet the required quantity for the birthday party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the number of cars Joe has after selling and giving some to his mother, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe's initial number of cars can be calculated as 2 * 20 = 40.

Next, we calculate the number of cars Joe sells. 20% of his cars are sold, which can be expressed as 0.2 * 40 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Then, we calculate the number of cars Joe gives away to his mother. Since he gives away twice as many cars as he sold, the number of cars given away is 2 * 8 = 16.

Finally, we subtract the number of cars given away from the number of cars Joe has after selling: 32 - 16 = 16.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we can employ a straightforward division approach. Given that the charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from external organizations, the remaining amount must have been contributed by the students.

The amount raised by the students can be calculated as follows:

Total amount raised by charity = $175,000
Amount raised by organizations = $50,000

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised by charity - Amount raised by organizations
= $175,000 - $50,000
= $125,000

Now, to find the amount each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

Amount raised by each student = Amount raised by students ÷ Number of students
= $125,000 ÷ 20
= $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression. Given that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we can express the time walked on the second day as 8/2 = 4 hours.

Total time walked in two days = Time walked on the first day + Time walked on the second day
= 8 hours + 4 hours
= 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60
= 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the parking lot had 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, increasing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that remained, we can calculate 1/2 of 70, which is (1/2) * 70 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we can employ the concept of total work hours and task-based compensation. Given that John completes 30 cycles of work per day, with each cycle consisting of 5 tasks, we can first determine the total number of tasks completed in a week.

Let's denote the number of tasks per cycle as 't' and the number of cycles per day as 'c'. The total number of tasks per day can be expressed as t * c, and the total number of tasks in a week as (t * c) * 7.

Given:
t = 5 (tasks per cycle)
c = 30 (cycles per day)

Total tasks per day = t * c = 5 * 30 = 150
Total tasks in a week = (t * c) * 7 = 150 * 7 = 1050

The payment per task is $1.20. To find the total weekly earnings, we multiply the total number of tasks in a week by the payment per task:

Total weekly earnings = Total tasks in a week * Payment per task
= 1050 * $1.20
= $1260

The final answer is: $1260"
"To determine Sasha's total points, we can break down the information provided into two separate equations based on the home and away games.

Let's denote Sasha's points in the first game as S1 and Julie's points in the first game as J1. We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, so S1 = 14.

We also know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so J1 = S1 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, we can calculate Sasha's total points by adding the points from both games: S1 + S2 = 14 + 4 = 18.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we can calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

Let's denote the number of packages of cat food as C and the number of packages of dog food as D. We are given that C = 8 and D = 6. Each package of cat food contains 11 tins, and each package of dog food contains 6 tins.

The total number of tins of cat food is given by the product of the number of packages and the number of tins per package: C * 11 = 8 * 11 = 88 tins.

Similarly, the total number of tins of dog food is given by the product of the number of packages and the number of tins per package: D * 6 = 6 * 6 = 36 tins.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food by subtracting the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of cards each person has. Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as x.

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, we can express Smendrick's card count as 3x. Becca, having 12 more cards than Smendrick, can be represented as 3x + 12.

The total number of cards is given as 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides yields:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7 results in:

x = 47

Now that we have found PJ's card count, we can determine Becca's card count by substituting x into the expression 3x + 12:

Becca's card count = 3(47) + 12
= 141 + 12
= 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. G = 5
2. B = 2G
3. P = B - 1
4. Y = P/3

We can substitute the values of B and P in terms of G into the equation for Y:

Y = (B - 1)/3
Y = ((2G - 1)/3)

Now, we can express the total number of eggs (T) as the sum of the individual types:

T = G + B + P + Y
T = G + 2G + (2G - 1) + (2G - 1)/3

Combine like terms and simplify:

T = 7G - 2/3

Substitute the given value of G:

T = 7(5) - 2/3
T = 35 - 2/3
T = 33 2/3

Therefore, Cindy had 33 2/3 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33 \frac{2}{3}}$"
"To determine the amount Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping can be calculated using the formula: Cost = (Weight * Rate per pound) + (Distance * Rate per mile)
In this case, the cost of shipping is:
Cost = (4 pounds * $0.35 per pound) + (20 miles * $0.08 per mile)
Cost = $1.40 + $1.60
Cost = $3.00

The refund amount is 75% of the purchase price:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Since Milly will have to pay the shipping cost, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price - Refund amount - Shipping cost
Amount Milly will lose = $32 - $24 - $3
Amount Milly will lose = $5

The final answer is: $5"
"To determine the amount of money Mulan has left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Mulan initially possesses, which is the sum of the amount she had and the amount her father gave her: $40 + $100 = $140.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the items she purchased, which includes two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. This can be expressed as 2 * $30 + $20 = $80.

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount to find the amount of money Mulan has left: $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Boris's monthly production is 50,000 bars. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we can subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

Total production for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Production for the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000 bars

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes. 

Next, we calculate the time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours/week.

Now, we add the time spent on each activity to find the total time spent on TikTok per week: 480 minutes + 1.5 hours = 481.5 minutes/week. To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 481.5 minutes / 60 = 8.025 hours/week.

Finally, we multiply the total time spent on TikTok per week by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks) to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month: 8.025 hours/week * 4 weeks = 32.1 hours.

The final answer is: 32.1"
"To determine the total cost for Angela, we need to calculate the cost of the standard items and the additional items separately and then sum them up.

The standard items include 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. The cost of these items is $129.00.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the number of additional items, we subtract the standard quantities from the quantities Angela has:

- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is calculated as follows:

- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

The total cost for Angela is the sum of the cost of the standard items and the additional items: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine Roy's savings, we can start by finding Anthony's savings. Since Anthony has $10 more than Eva, and Eva has $20, we can express this as an equation:

Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10
Anthony's savings = $20 + $10
Anthony's savings = $30

Next, we know that Roy has 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we can multiply Anthony's savings by 0.4:

40% of Anthony's savings = 0.4 × $30
= $12

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
= $30 + $12
= $42

Therefore, Roy has $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"To determine the height Naruto can lift, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach.

Let's denote the height Naruto can lift as N, the height Kagiyami can lift as K, and the height Saskay can lift as S. We are given the following relationships:

1. N = 10K (Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami)
2. K = 4S (Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay)
3. S = 12 (Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches)

We can substitute the value of S into the second equation to find K:
K = 4S
K = 4(12)
K = 48

Now, we can substitute the value of K into the first equation to find N:
N = 10K
N = 10(48)
N = 480

To convert the height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
N = 480 / 12
N = 40 feet

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can utilize the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. Given that Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour and he travels for 4 hours initially, followed by an additional 6 hours, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
Total Distance = (8 miles/hour × 4 hours) + (8 miles/hour × 6 hours)
Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total Distance = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative motion and the inverse relationship between speed, distance, and time. Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as 'v' and the speed of a turtle as 'v/2'. We are given that 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, so we can set up the equation:

3v * 18 = d

where 'd' is the distance across the highway.

Now, we can find the speed of a kangaroo:

v = d / (3 * 18)
v = d / 54

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle:

v_turtle = v / 2
v_turtle = (d / 54) / 2
v_turtle = d / 108

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = d / (d / 108)
Time = 108

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 108 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as 'x'. Since Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, the number of dishes Rory made can be expressed as x + 20. Jada, on the other hand, made twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes Jada made can be represented as 2(x + 20).

We are given that Kora made 20 dishes, so x = 20. Substituting this value into the expressions for Rory and Jada's dishes, we get:

Rory's dishes: x + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
Jada's dishes: 2(x + 20) = 2(20 + 20) = 2(40) = 80

Now, let's calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:
Total = Kora's dishes + Rory's dishes + Jada's dishes
Total = 20 + 40 + 80
Total = 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as x.

The total cost of the laptop after trading in her old one is $400. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and received $80 from her mom. The amount she still needs to buy the laptop is $50. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230

x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of slices and then subtracting the number of slices Adam consumed.

First, we calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately. 

Let's denote the number of large apples as L and the number of small apples as S. We are given that L = 3 and S = 5. 

The number of slices from large apples is 5L = 5(3) = 15 slices.
The number of slices from small apples is 3S = 3(5) = 15 slices.

The total number of slices is the sum of the slices from large and small apples: 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is 30 - 15 = 15 slices.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use a simple proportion. Let's denote the number of cows needed as x. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the following proportion:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 25 liters

To find the number of cows needed, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 liters:

x = 25 liters / 5 liters/cow
x = 5 cows

However, this calculation assumes that the milk production rate remains constant. In reality, milk production can be affected by factors such as feed quality, breed, and health. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this calculation, we can proceed with the assumption that the milk production rate remains constant.

The farmer needs 5 - 3 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 2"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

Let's analyze each glue stick individually:

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
   (5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
   (1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
   (1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine the amount of money Gabriel still needs, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the items: $10,000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10,800.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has: $5,000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5,200.

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost: $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Final answer: $5600"
"To determine the change Thea received, we can calculate the difference between the amount she paid ($80) and the price of the hat ($70).

Change = Amount Paid - Price of Hat
Change = $80 - $70
Change = $10

Therefore, Thea received $10 in change."
"To determine the amount of money Craig has left, we can calculate the total cost of the items he purchased and subtract it from his initial amount of $40.

Craig buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, resulting in a total cost of 6 × $2 = $12. He also purchases 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, adding another $9 to his total expenditure. The combined cost is $12 + $9 = $21.

Now, we subtract the total amount spent from Craig's initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Therefore, Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of socks and dishes each individual has.

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S and the number of dishes Jack has as D. We are given that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can express this relationship as:

D = 2S

We are also given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

60 = 2S

Solving for S, we find that:

S = 60 / 2
S = 30

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can express this relationship as:

P = 2S

Substituting the value of S, we get:

P = 2(30)
P = 60

Now that we have the number of socks each individual has, we can find the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

Total Socks = S + P
Total Socks = 30 + 60
Total Socks = 90

Total Dishes = D
Total Dishes = 60

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
Total = Total Socks + Total Dishes
Total = 90 + 60
Total = 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students good at math only as M, the number of students good at English only as E, and the number of students good at both math and English as B.

Given:
T = 20
M = 5
E = 8

We are tasked with finding the value of M + B, which represents the total number of students good at math.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can express the total number of students as:

T = M + E + B

Rearranging the equation to solve for B, we get:

B = T - M - E
= 20 - 5 - 8
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English:

M + B = 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total available time and the time required for each group's performance, including setup and teardown.

The total available time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, 6 minutes for performance, and 2 minutes for teardown, resulting in a total time of 18 minutes per group.

To find the maximum number of groups that can perform, we can divide the total available time by the time required per group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time per group
= 120 minutes / 18 minutes
= 6.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure that all groups have sufficient time to perform without exceeding the total available time. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 6.

Final answer: 6"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can utilize the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount after t years
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75 as a decimal)
t = time in years (3)

First, we'll calculate the interest earned each year and add it to the principal amount.

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225, Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $525 * 0.75 = $393.75, Total = $525 + $393.75 = $918.75
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $918.75 * 0.75 = $693.5625, Total = $918.75 + $693.5625 = $1612.3125

Rounded to two decimal places, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $1612.31.

The final answer is $1612.31."
"To determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of white shirts with collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, we can calculate this as:

Number of white shirts with collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we can calculate the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we can employ a straightforward calculation. The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. 

First, we calculate the number of trays the farmer can fill: 

900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray = 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can find the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

Let's denote the initial number of goats in Farm X as x and the initial number of goats in Farm Y as y. We are given that x = 55 and y = 45.

Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is x - 10. He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats left in Farm Y is y - 20.

The total number of goats left in both farms can be calculated as (x - 10) + (y - 20).

Substituting the given values, we get:
(x - 10) + (y - 20) = (55 - 10) + (45 - 20)
= 45 + 25
= 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether."
"To determine the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can utilize the formula for calculating average value, which is the total value divided by the number of items. In this scenario, the total value is the annual expenditure on shoes, and the number of items is the number of pairs purchased per year.

Given that James spends $2640 on shoes each year and buys 2 pairs, we can calculate the average cost per pair as follows:

Average cost per pair = Total annual expenditure on shoes / Number of pairs purchased per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

Therefore, James pays an average of $1320 for each pair of shoes.

The final answer is: $1320"
"To determine the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with a $2 discount on each basket of red food, we can break down the problem into two components: the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food with the discount.

The cost of 3 baskets of green food can be calculated as follows:

3 * $25 = $75

For the red food, we first calculate the total cost without the discount: 
3 * $18 = $54

Since there is a $2 discount for each basket of red food, we subtract $6 from the total cost:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

Therefore, the total cost is $123."
"To determine the time required to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the number of rooms that is one-half of 90, which is 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we can divide the total minutes by 60:

900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

In the first year, the town will construct 12 homes. In the subsequent year, they will build three times this amount, resulting in 3 * 12 = 36 homes. In the third year, they will double the cumulative total from the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of homes built over the three-year period by summing the individual year's contributions: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

Therefore, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{144}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote your age as x, your brother's age as x + 3, and your sister's age as x - 2. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so it can be represented as 3(x + 3) - 1.

The sum of your ages is 87, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + 3(x + 3) - 1 = 87

"To determine the number of packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can use the concept of ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the nearest whole number. 

Let's calculate the number of glue sticks needed: 27 students × 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks. 

Since each pack contains 8 glue sticks, we can divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 ÷ 8 = 6.75. 

To find the minimum number of packs required, we apply the ceiling function: ceil(6.75) = 7.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks, with some extra sticks left over.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth. Given that the amount of water doubles on the second day, we can express this as a mathematical equation:

Water on Day 1 = 4000 gallons
Water on Day 2 = 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons
Water on Day 3 = 2 * 8000 + 6000

Using the properties of exponential growth, we can simplify the equation:

Water on Day 3 = 2 * (2 * 4000) + 6000
= 2^2 * 4000 + 6000
= 4 * 4000 + 6000
= 16000 + 6000
= 22000 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22000 gallons.

Final answer: 22000"
"This problem can be modeled using the concept of exponential growth, where the number of infected individuals grows by a fixed factor each day. In this case, the initial number of infected individuals is 10, and each infected person infects 6 others, resulting in a growth factor of 6.

The number of infected individuals on day n can be represented by the formula:

N(n) = N0 * (1 + r)^n

where N0 is the initial number of infected individuals (10 in this case), r is the growth factor (6 in this case), and n is the number of days.

To find the total number of infected individuals after 3 days, we can plug in n = 3 into the formula:

N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3
= 10 * (7)^3
= 10 * 343
= 3430

Therefore, the total number of infected individuals after 3 days is 3430.

The final answer is: 3430"
"To determine the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can calculate the amount of tips each of them received.

Since each of the forty customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips as 40 * $20 = $800.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we can calculate 0.1 * $800 = $80. Then, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips: $800 - $80 = $720.

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges given away: 3 daughters received 2 oranges each, and 1 son received 3 oranges. This results in a total of 6 + 3 = 9 oranges given away.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the initial number of oranges purchased: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we can analyze their badge-earning rates.

Claire's badge-earning rate is 1 badge per month, which translates to 12 badges per year. Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, her badge-earning rate is 1/2 of Claire's rate, resulting in 6 badges per year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so her badge-earning rate is 3 * 12 = 36 badges per year.

To find the difference in badge earnings between Wendy and Amber, we subtract Amber's total from Wendy's total: 36 - 6 = 30 badges.

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total amount raised, we can employ a straightforward approach. Paige baked 10 loaves of banana bread, with each loaf yielding 8 slices.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of coins Gretchen had, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We are given that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

Subtracting 30 from both sides yields:

x = 40

Now, to find the total number of coins, we can add the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = x + (x + 30)
= 40 + 70
= 110

Therefore, Gretchen had a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. With 50 students receiving 10 burritos each, the total number of burritos distributed is 50 * 10 = 500.

Next, we subtract the number of burritos consumed by Mr. George, which is 20, from the total number of burritos distributed. This yields 500 - 20 = 480.

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is 480.

The final answer is 480."
"To determine the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of red cars as R, the number of green cars as G, the number of blue cars as B, and the number of yellow cars as Y.

We are given the following information:

1. R = 12
2. G = R - 2
3. B = 3G
4. R + G + B + Y = 75

Substituting the first two equations into the fourth equation, we get:

12 + (12 - 2) + 3(12 - 2) + Y = 75

Simplifying the equation:

12 + 10 + 3(10) + Y = 75
12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75
52 + Y = 75

Subtracting 52 from both sides:

Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink is 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x, Anne has as y, and Sofie has as z.

We are given that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, which can be expressed as:

z = y + 25

We are also given that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, which can be expressed as:

y = x - 12

Lastly, we know that the total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 85

Substituting the expressions for z and y in terms of x into the total equation, we get:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 13 = 85

Subtract 13 from both sides:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Therefore, Fawn has 24 books.

"To determine the weight of the carrots, we can start by finding the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, we can express this relationship as a mathematical equation:

Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * Weight of potatoes
Weight of sweet potatoes = 2 * 5
Weight of sweet potatoes = 10 pounds

Next, we can find the weight of the carrots by subtracting 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

Weight of carrots = Weight of sweet potatoes - 3
Weight of carrots = 10 - 3
Weight of carrots = 7 pounds

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cups required. Given that there are 30 kids and each kid will receive 4 cups, the total number of cups needed is:

30 kids * 4 cups/kid = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box of jello yields 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes required by dividing the total cups needed by the number of cups per box:

120 cups / 10 cups/box = 12 boxes

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box:

12 boxes * $1.25/box = $15

Therefore, Greg will spend $15 on jello for his son's birthday party.

The final answer is: $15"
"To determine the change the seller will receive, we need to calculate the difference between the amount given ($4000) and the total cost of the phones ($3500).

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly expenditure, we can first calculate his monthly expenditure by finding 40% of the total monthly cost. 

Let's calculate 40% of $400: 

40% = 0.4
Monthly expenditure = 0.4 * $400 = $160

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can divide the monthly expenditure by 4 to find Keenan's weekly expenditure:

Weekly expenditure = $160 / 4
Weekly expenditure = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of pieces remaining after the first day. Since Tobias ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can calculate the remaining pieces as follows:

Remaining pieces after the first day = Total pieces - Pieces eaten on the first day
= 60 - (2/5 * 60)
= 60 - 24
= 36

Next, we subtract the 10 pieces eaten on the second day:

Remaining pieces after the second day = 36 - 10
= 26

Now, we need to find 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces:

Pieces eaten on the third day = (7/13) * 26
= (7/13) * (26/1)
= 7 * 2
= 14

Finally, we add up the pieces eaten each day:

Total pieces eaten = Pieces eaten on the first day + Pieces eaten on the second day + Pieces eaten on the third day
= 24 + 10 + 14
= 48

Therefore, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the total cost of the items David wants to purchase, we can apply the principles of arithmetic operations.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the soda: 3 bottles of soda at $21.00 each will be 3 × $21.00 = $63.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the water: 2 bottles of water at $8.00 each will be 2 × $8.00 = $16.00.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the soda and the cost of the water: $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00.

"To determine the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the bolts by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:

Total Cost = Number of Bolts * Cost per Bolt
Total Cost = 16 * $0.03
Total Cost = $0.48

Next, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining Amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"To determine Ella's hourly wage, we can utilize the concept of unitary rates. Given that she earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking, we can calculate her hourly wage as follows:

Hourly wage = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly wage = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly wage = $11 per hour

To find Ella's earnings after 12 hours, we can multiply her hourly wage by the total number of hours she will work:

Total earnings = Hourly wage * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

Therefore, Ella's total earnings after 12 hours of dog walking will be $132.

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after receiving 28 marbles from his friend. This can be done by adding the initial number of marbles (52) to the number of marbles he received (28), resulting in a total of 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has. To do this, we multiply 80 by 1/4, which can be expressed as 80 * (1/4) = 80 * 0.25 = 20. This means Paul loses 20 marbles.

Finally, we subtract the number of marbles lost (20) from the total number of marbles Paul had after receiving the additional marbles (80). This results in 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine Amy's total score, we can calculate the points from each type of question and add them together.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions. Since there are 10 questions, and each question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions can be calculated as:

10 questions * 1 point per question = 10 points

Next, we'll calculate the points from the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions, and each question is worth 1 point. Therefore, the total points from true/false questions can be calculated as:

20 questions * 1 point per question = 20 points

Lastly, we'll calculate the points from the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions, and each question is worth 5 points. Therefore, the total points from long-answer questions can be calculated as:

5 questions * 5 points per question = 25 points

Now, we can add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score:

10 points (multiple-choice) + 20 points (true/false) + 25 points (long-answer) = 55 points

"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we can use the concept of profit and loss. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens at $50 each. Let's denote the cost price of each chicken as x.

The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is 180 * 50 = $9000. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost price of the chickens should be $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

The total cost price of 180 chickens is 180x. To find the cost price of each chicken, we can divide the total cost price by the number of chickens:

180x = $7000

x = $7000 / 180

x = $38.89

So, Isaias bought the chickens for approximately $38.89 each.

The final answer is: $38.89"
"To determine the number of glasses Julie sold more than Micah, we can start by finding the total number of glasses sold by the boys. Since Julie sold 14 glasses, and the total number of glasses sold is 32, the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.

As there are two boys, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by the boys by 2 to find the number of glasses each boy sold:

18 glasses ÷ 2 = 9 glasses per boy

Now, we can find the difference in the number of glasses sold by Julie and Micah by subtracting Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 9 glasses (Micah) = 5 glasses

The final answer is: 5"

"To solve this problem, we can start by representing Melanie's current age as 'x'. Since she will be 18 in 10 years, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

Now, we need to find the number of years when her age will be thrice her present age. This can be represented as:

3x = ?

Substituting the value of x, we get:

3(8) = 24

Since Melanie is currently 8 years old, we need to find the number of years it will take for her age to be 24. 

24 - 8 = 16 years.

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

- The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.
- The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.
- The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To determine the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the runtime of her usual concerts as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the runtime of the final concert as 2x. Additionally, we know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore. Therefore, the total runtime of the final concert can be represented as 2x + 15.

Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the number of toys Argo has now, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. We start with the initial number of toys Argo had, which is 200, and then subtract the total number of toys he gave away.

The total number of toys given away is the sum of the toys given to Alyssa, Bonnie, and Nicky, which can be calculated as follows:

Toys given away = 40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky)
Toys given away = 150

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:

Number of toys Argo has now = Initial number of toys - Toys given away
= 200 - 150
= 50

Therefore, Argo has 50 toys now."

"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we can start by finding the total number of microphones that can fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, we can calculate the number of microphones that can fit by subtracting the number of non-fitting microphones from the total.

Let's denote the total number of microphones as 'T'. We know that 20% of T won't fit, so the number of non-fitting microphones is 0.2T. The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is then T - 0.2T = 0.8T.

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 0.8T / 2 = 0.4T.

Given that the total number of microphones is 50, we can substitute T = 50 into the equation: 0.4T = 0.4 * 50 = 20.

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of birds, we can break down the problem into three distinct components: birds in the bushes, birds flying overhead, and birds feeding. 

First, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead, which is 2/3 of the number of birds in the bushes. Since there are 6 birds in the bushes, we can express this as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we calculate the total number of birds feeding, which is 3 groups of 8 birds each. This can be expressed as:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to find the total:

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, the total number of birds is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"

Cookies left = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten
Cookies left = 55 - 5
Cookies left = 50

Since the remaining cookies are to be divided equally into 5 jars, we can use the division operation to find the number of cookies in each jar.

Cookies in each jar = Cookies left ÷ 5
Cookies in each jar = 50 ÷ 5
Cookies in each jar = 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the difference in the number of petals between the orchids and daisies, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids by multiplying the number of orchids (5) by the number of petals per orchid (5): 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies by multiplying the number of daisies (4) by the number of petals per daisy (10): 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies to find the difference: 40 - 25 = 15 petals.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants. This can be calculated as:

Number of indoor plants = (1/4) * 100
= 25

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants. This is given by:

Number of remaining plants = Total number of plants - Number of indoor plants
= 100 - 25
= 75

Now, we are told that two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. We can calculate this as:

Number of outdoor plants = (2/3) * 75
= 50

Finally, we find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

Number of flowering plants = Number of remaining plants - Number of outdoor plants
= 75 - 50
= 25

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

Percentage of flowering plants = (25 / 100) * 100
= 25%

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the speeds of the whirligig and the thingamabob. 

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can express the speed of the whatchamacallit as 11x. 

We are given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
11x = 121 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we have determined the speed of the thingamabob (x = 11 meters per second), we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins five times faster than the thingamabob. 
Speed of whirligig = 5x 
= 5 * 11 
= 55 meters per second 

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we can start by calculating the total cost of the salad and yogurt. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Mark's new weekly earnings, we can calculate his hourly wage and then multiply it by the total number of hours he works in a week.

Mark's original hourly wage was $10, and it was increased by $2. Therefore, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, the total number of hours he works in a week is 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

To find Mark's weekly earnings, we multiply his hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.

Therefore, Mark's new weekly earnings are $480."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to analyze the given information and apply basic algebraic techniques.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as x. Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x. Similarly, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x.

Given that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns can be represented as 6x. We know that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $80. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

6x = 80

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we cannot mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach. Let's denote Martin's weight as M, Carl's weight as C, Christian's weight as X, and Harry's weight as H.

Given:
1. M = 55 kg
2. C = M + 16
3. X = C + 8
4. H = X - 5

Substituting the values, we get:
C = 55 + 16 = 71 kg
X = 71 + 8 = 79 kg
H = 79 - 5 = 74 kg

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To calculate John's profit, we can employ the concept of hourly wage and total hours worked. Given that he rents his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time and earns $25 per hour, we can determine his total earnings as follows:

Total earnings = Hourly wage * Total hours worked
Total earnings = $25/hour * 30 hours
Total earnings = $750

Next, we subtract his car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:

Profit = Total earnings - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500
Profit = $250

Therefore, John's monthly profit from renting his car is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph had initially as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can express Martha's initial number of notebooks as 3x.

We are told that Martha bought 5 more notebooks, resulting in a total of 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:

3x + 5 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

3x = 7 - 5
3x = 2

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x:

x = 2/3

Now that we know Joseph initially had 2/3 notebooks, we can find the difference in the number of notebooks between Martha and Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 2/3 notebooks. To find the difference, we can subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - (2/3)
= 7 - 2/3
= (21/3) - (2/3)
= 19/3

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

19 ÷ 3 = 6 with a remainder of 1

So, Martha has 6 and 1/3 more notebooks than Joseph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{19}{3}}$"
"To determine the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let's denote Dijana's distance as x. Then, Anis' distance can be represented as x + (1/5)x, which simplifies to (6/5)x.

We are given that Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis' distance by substituting the value of x into the expression (6/5)x:
Anis' distance = (6/5) * 50
Anis' distance = 60

To find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis, we add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we must first account for the reduction in the total number of cookies due to the husband's actions. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of cookies taken from the initial total.

Let's denote the initial total number of cookies as T and the number of cookies taken by the husband as H. The remaining cookies can be calculated as:

T - H = 100 - 4 = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews (N) to determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive:

Cookies per nephew = (T - H) / N
= 96 / 6
= 16

Therefore, each nephew will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we can analyze their reading patterns.

Let's denote the number of pages Denise read yesterday as D1 and the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as D2. We are given that D1 = 10 and D2 = 13.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, we can represent the number of pages Denise read today as D3 = D1 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.

The total number of pages read by Denise is the sum of the pages read yesterday and today, which is D1 + D3 = 10 + 15 = 25. Similarly, the total number of pages read by Daniel is D2 = 13.

To find the difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise: 25 - 13 = 12.

Therefore, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the total capacity of the pot and the number of bowls consumed for dinner.

Let's denote the total capacity of the pot as C and the number of bowls consumed for dinner as D. We know that C can fill either four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. This implies that C = 4x and C = 8y, where x and y are positive integers.

Since Calvin, his wife, and himself make a total of 4 adults, we can set up the equation 4x = 8y. This equation is satisfied when x = 2y.

Now, we know that D = 4 (the number of bowls consumed for dinner). To find the number of bowls left for lunch, we subtract D from C: C - D = 4x - 4 = 8y - 4.

Since there are two children, we want to find the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch. Let's denote this number as z. We can set up the equation 2z = 8y - 4.

To find the maximum possible value of z, we need to find the largest possible value of y. Since x = 2y, we can rewrite the equation as 2z = 8(2y) - 4 = 16y - 4.

Now, we want to find the largest integer value of y such that 16y - 4 is greater than or equal to 2. This can be rewritten as 16y ≥ 6, which implies y ≥ 6/16 = 3/8. Since y must be an integer, the largest possible value of y is 1.

Substituting y = 1 into the equation 2z = 16y - 4, we get 2z = 16(1) - 4 = 12, which implies z = 6.

However, since we are looking for the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the case where y = 1 and the number of bowls left for lunch is 0. In this case, each child cannot have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine the total cost of the items purchased, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the notebooks: 5 notebooks × $1.50 per notebook = $7.50.

Next, we add the cost of the ballpen: $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8.

The final answer is: $8"
"To determine the total material required, we can calculate the material needed for small and large masks separately and then sum the results.

For small masks, we have 20 masks, and each set requires 2 yards of material. Therefore, the total material needed for small masks is:

20 masks / 4 masks per 2 yards = 5 sets of 2 yards
5 sets × 2 yards/set = 10 yards

For large masks, we have 8 masks, and each set requires 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the total material needed for large masks is:

8 masks / 3 masks per 2.25 yards = 8/3 sets of 2.25 yards
8/3 × 2.25 yards/set = 6 yards

The total material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks:

10 yards (small masks) + 6 yards (large masks) = 16 yards

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the average price per ticket, we can utilize the formula for average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this scenario, the total amount spent ($216) is the sum of the individual ticket prices, and the total number of tickets (27) is the number of values.

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
= $216 / 27
= $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we can calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on various activities.

A standard day consists of 24 hours. Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, which translates to 10 - 2 = 8 hours of work. Additionally, he walks his dog for 1 hour.

The total hours spent on these activities can be calculated as follows:

10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, we subtract these hours from the total hours in a day:

24 (total hours in a day) - 19 (hours spent on activities) = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of blue and red shoe boxes left, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of blue shoe boxes remaining by subtracting the number used from the total:
7 (initial blue shoe boxes) - 3 (blue shoe boxes used) = 4

Next, we calculate 1/3 of the total number of red shoe boxes:
(1/3) * 9 = 3

Now, we subtract the number of red shoe boxes used from the total:
9 (initial red shoe boxes) - 3 (red shoe boxes used) = 6

Therefore, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of books Sarah has as 's' and the number of books Joseph has as 'j'. We are given that Sarah has 9 books, so s = 9.

We are also given that Joseph has twice the number of books Sarah has, but he lost 2 of them. This can be represented as j = 2s - 2.

Substituting the value of s into the equation, we get j = 2(9) - 2.

j = 18 - 2

j = 16

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the number of marbles Dean gave to Jamie, which is 1/5 of his initial 30 marbles. This can be expressed as:

(1/5) × 30 = 6

Next, we add the 10 marbles he gave to Donald:

6 (given to Jamie) + 10 (given to Donald) = 16

Now, we subtract the total marbles given away from the initial amount:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent the given information and derive the desired outcome.

Let's denote Duncan's current age as 'D' and Adam's current age as 'A'. According to the problem statement, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:

D - 8 = 2(A - 4)

We are also given that Duncan's current age is 60. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)
52 = 2A - 8

Now, we can solve for 'A' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

52 + 8 = 2A
60 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:

A = 60 / 2
A = 30

To determine Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

A + 8 = 30 + 8
A + 8 = 38

Therefore, Adam's age in 8 years will be 38.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38}$"
"To determine the total number of acres of the two farms, we can start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Since Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Let x be the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm.
Farmer Smith's farm = 2x + 100

We know that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so we can substitute x = 200 into the equation:

Farmer Smith's farm = 2(200) + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 + 100
Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Now, we can find the total number of acres by adding the sizes of both farms:

Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 + 500
Total acres = 700

Therefore, the total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"To determine Colby's daily earnings, we need to calculate the total number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. 

Given that he completes 10 fewer packages than the standard 50 packages per hour, his hourly production rate is 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour. 

Since he works for 8 hours, his total production for the day is 40 * 8 = 320 packages.

As he earns $0.20 for each package, his daily earnings can be calculated as 320 * $0.20 = $64.

The final answer is: $64"
"To determine the number of bottles of water John drinks, we need to calculate the total time spent on both sudoku puzzles and then divide it by the time interval between each bottle.

The time for a normal sudoku is 45 minutes, and the time for an extreme sudoku is 4 times that, which equals 180 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku is 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can calculate the number of bottles by dividing the total time by 30 minutes.

Number of bottles = Total time / 30
= 225 minutes / 30
= 7.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bottle, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can also consider the context of the problem. If John drinks a bottle every half hour, it is likely that he will drink a full bottle in 30 minutes, but he will not have time to drink another full bottle in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, we can round down to 7 bottles.

However, to be mathematically precise, we can represent this as:

Number of bottles = ceil(225 / 30)
= ceil(7.5)
= 8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a bottle, we can represent the answer as 8 bottles.

Final answer: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We are given that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58, and there are 20 red balloons.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon's car requires, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that Jon drives 100 miles per day and the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we can calculate the total number of miles driven in 30 days as follows:

Total miles driven = miles driven per day * number of days
Total miles driven = 100 miles/day * 30 days
Total miles driven = 3000 miles

Now, we can divide the total miles driven by the interval at which the tune-ups are required to find the number of tune-ups needed:

Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven / miles per tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up
Number of tune-ups = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To determine the total hours worked by Bruce over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

Let's denote the hours worked on Tuesday as T, Wednesday as W, and Thursday as Th. We are given the following information:

T = 5 hours
W = 2T
Th = W - 2

Substituting the value of W into the equation for Th, we get:
Th = 2T - 2
Th = 2(5) - 2
Th = 10 - 2
Th = 8 hours

Now, we can calculate the total hours worked by adding the hours worked each day:
Total hours = T + W + Th
Total hours = 5 + 2T + 8
Total hours = 5 + 2(5) + 8
Total hours = 5 + 10 + 8
Total hours = 23 hours

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we can analyze the expenses incurred by the girls.

Let's denote the amount of money each girl received as x. The total amount spent on the cake and balloons can be calculated as $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17. Additionally, the cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is $14.

Since the girls combined their allowance, the total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x = 31

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 31/2

x = 15.5

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $15.50.

The final answer is: $15.50"
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left after Lola ate 2 pieces, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of fruits Kira initially purchased: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Next, we subtract the number of fruits Lola ate from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

"To determine the total number of students, we can calculate the number of students in each activity and then sum them up.

First, we note that there are 6 students playing tennis and 2 times that number playing volleyball, which is 2 * 6 = 12 students. 

Next, we add the number of students playing soccer, which is 16 boys and 22 girls, for a total of 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we can calculate the total number of students by adding the students from each activity: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised from the sale of lollipops, we can employ the concept of linear multiplication to determine the total number of lollipops sold and then apply the profit per lollipop to arrive at the total profit.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:
Number of lollipops sold = Number of students * Number of lollipops sold per student
= 30 * 10
= 300 lollipops

2. Determine the profit per lollipop:
Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

3. Calculate the total profit:
Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each type of pet individually.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Since he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, the number of dogs can be calculated as 3 * 3 = 9.

Next, we are told that Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Therefore, the number of rabbits can be found by subtracting 2 from the number of dogs: 9 - 2 = 7.

The fish tank contains three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21.

Lastly, the number of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, which can be calculated as 1/3 * 21 = 7.

To find the total number of pets, we add the number of each type of pet together: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we can employ a simple division-based approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Abby eats per day as A and the number of slices Josh eats per day as J. We are given that J = 2A. The total number of slices eaten per day is A + J, and the total number of slices in the loaf is 24. 

We can express this as an equation: A + J = 24. Substituting J = 2A into the equation, we get A + 2A = 24, which simplifies to 3A = 24. Solving for A, we find A = 8. 

Now that we know Abby eats 8 slices per day, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten per day: A + J = 8 + 2(8) = 8 + 16 = 24. 

However, this would mean the bread would last 0 days, which is not possible. This indicates that the initial assumption that Josh eats twice as much as Abby is incorrect. 

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Josh eats twice as much as Abby, then Josh eats 2A slices per day. The correct equation should be A + 2A = 24, which simplifies to 3A = 24. Solving for A, we find A = 8. 

Now that we know Abby eats 8 slices per day, we can calculate the total number of slices eaten per day: A + 2A = 8 + 16 = 24.

"To determine the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic progression. Since Martha collects one shell per month, the number of shells she has collected can be calculated as follows:

Number of shells = Number of months * Rate of collection
= 5 years * 12 months/year * 1 shell/month
= 60 shells

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2) * (a + l)
where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.

In this case, n = 5 (number of years), a = 1 (first term, i.e., the number of shells collected at age 5), and l = 60 (last term, i.e., the number of shells collected at age 10).

Sum = (5/2) * (1 + 60)
= 2.5 * 61
= 152.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a shell, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Martha has collected 152 shells.

The final answer is: $\boxed{152}$"
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can utilize the concept of division. Given that Lana has a total of 27 cups and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are allocated for mint tea. 

First, we calculate the number of cups of mint tea: 27 (total cups) - 15 (cinnamon tea) = 12 cups of mint tea.

Since the cups are divided into 3 rows, we can express this as a division problem: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can collect per trip, we can employ a simple division-based approach. Given that the sloth has 8 hours to collect berries and each round trip (down and back) takes 4 hours, the sloth can make a maximum of 2 trips within this timeframe.

Let's denote the number of berries collected per trip as 'x'. Since the sloth aims to collect a total of 24 berries, we can set up the following equation:

2x = 24

To find the minimum value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the sloth can collect a minimum of 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the initial amount of water in the tank, which is half of the pool's capacity. This can be expressed as:

Initial water in tank = (1/2) * Pool capacity
= (1/2) * 10000 gallons
= 5000 gallons

Next, we need to account for the rate at which the tank is being emptied. The tank is emptied at a constant rate of 500 gallons per day. To find the total amount of water remaining after 6 days, we can subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount:

Remaining water in tank = Initial water in tank - (Rate of emptying * Number of days)
= 5000 gallons - (500 gallons/day * 6 days)
= 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons
= 2000 gallons

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2000}$"
"To determine the number of movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses of popcorn and candy. His monthly allowance is $150, and he has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, resulting in a remaining budget of $150 - $8 - $8 = $134.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. This leaves him with $134 - $10 = $124.

To find out how many movies he can see, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost of a movie ticket. 

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Colby can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the total calories of the pastries, we can calculate the calories of each type of pastry separately and then sum them.

The calories of a mini cinnamon roll can be calculated by multiplying the calories of a normal cinnamon roll by 1/3, since it has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version. This can be expressed as:

Calories of mini cinnamon roll = (1/3) * Calories of normal cinnamon roll
= (1/3) * 600
= 200 calories

Similarly, the calories of a mini blueberry muffin can be calculated by multiplying the calories of a normal blueberry muffin by 1/3:

Calories of mini blueberry muffin = (1/3) * Calories of normal blueberry muffin
= (1/3) * 450
= 150 calories

Now, we can calculate the total calories of the pastries by summing the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:

Total calories = Calories of mini cinnamon rolls + Calories of mini blueberry muffins
= 200 * 300 + 150 * 300
= 60,000 + 45,000
= 105,000 calories

The total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 105,000."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we can employ the concept of arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of values.

Let's break down the data:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 2 × 39 = 78 Junebugs (combined)
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 262

Since there are 5 days in total, we can calculate the average as follows:

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 262 / 5
= 52.4

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs removed per day is 52.4.

The final answer is 52.4."
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between the bus and the car, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For the bus, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

For the car, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car
Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
Difference = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we can utilize a simple subtraction approach. Let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had and then subtract that from the total number of toys she now has.

Total number of toys initially = 31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48

Total number of toys now = 62

Number of bouncy balls = Total number of toys now - Total number of toys initially
= 62 - 48
= 14

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: P + (P + 10) + J = 100
2. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age: P = (P + 10) + J

We can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation 2P + J = 90:

2((P + 10) + J) + J = 90

Expand and simplify:

2P + 20 + 2J = 90

Subtract 20 from both sides:

2P + 2J = 70

Divide both sides by 2:

P + J = 35

Now, we can substitute P = (P + 10) + J into the equation P + J = 35:

(P + 10) + J + J = 35

Combine like terms:

P + 2J + 10 = 35

Subtract 10 from both sides:

P + 2J = 25

Now we have two equations:

P + J = 35
P + 2J = 25

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

(P + 2J) - (P + J) = 25 - 35

This simplifies to:

J = -10

However, this solution is not valid since age cannot be negative. We made an error in our previous steps.

Let's re-examine our work. We can rewrite the equation P = (P + 10) + J as:

P - P = J + 10

This simplifies to:

0 = J + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-10 = J

This solution is also invalid since age cannot be negative.

We made another error. Let's re-evaluate our work.

35 - J = (35 - J) + 10 + J

Simplify:

35 - J = 35 + 10

Subtract 35 from both sides:

- J = 10

J = -10

"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. Initially, Maria and her 4 friends each received 2 water balloons, resulting in a total of 8 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon to this initial count yields a preliminary total of 9 balloons.

Next, we must consider the additional balloons provided by Maria's mother. Since there are 5 individuals (Maria and her 4 friends) and each received 3 more balloons, the total number of additional balloons is 5 * 3 = 15.

Combining the initial 9 balloons with the 15 additional balloons, we obtain a grand total of 9 + 15 = 24 water balloons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of new tables required, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available for display. Since 10 individuals donated 5 boxes each, the total number of donated boxes is 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Adding the 10 boxes already owned by the charity group, we have a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Given that each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the number of tables needed by dividing the total number of boxes by 2. This yields 60 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

However, the charity group already possesses 15 tables. To determine the number of new tables required, we subtract the existing tables from the total tables needed: 30 tables - 15 tables = 15 tables.

Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated and existing items.

Final answer: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we need to calculate the total distance each individual spat and then find the mean of these two values.

Zoey's total distance spat can be calculated as the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet.

Similarly, Sydney's total distance spat can be calculated as the product of the number of seeds and the distance each seed is spat: 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both individuals is the sum of their individual distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we can calculate the monthly production and revenue for each machine.

First, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month. We can do this by multiplying the number of widgets produced per hour, the number of hours worked per day, and the number of days worked per month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400

Next, we can calculate the total revenue generated by each machine by multiplying the total number of widgets produced by the price of each widget.

Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in the total amount of money Fern will make from the two machines, we subtract the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:

$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost-effectiveness of Cameron's decision, we can calculate the total cost of both options and compare them.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos. Since Cameron wants to stay for 5 additional hours, we need to calculate the cost of these extra hours. The hotel charges an additional 70 pesos per hour for hours beyond the initial 12 hours. Therefore, the cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is the sum of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional 5 hours: 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, we can calculate the cost of the full 24 hours: 1600 pesos.

Cameron's decision to opt for the extended stay results in a cost savings of 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the extended stay option.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can calculate the amount of hay required for each type of livestock and then sum them together.

Let's denote the amount of hay each goat needs as G and the amount each sheep needs as S. We are given that G = 5 pounds. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, we can express this as S = 2G - 3.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for goats and sheep. The total amount of hay needed for goats is 15G, and the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12S.

Substituting S = 2G - 3 into the expression for the total amount of hay needed for sheep, we get 12(2G - 3). 

Now, we can substitute G = 5 into the expressions for the total amount of hay needed for goats and sheep. The total amount of hay needed for goats is 15(5) = 75 pounds, and the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12(2(5) - 3) = 12(7) = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay needed for goats and sheep, which is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

"To determine John's remaining funds after purchasing the pencils, we can calculate his earnings and subsequent expenditures.

John's hourly wage is $50, and he worked for 6 hours, resulting in total earnings of $300. After spending $50 on gas, he has $300 - $50 = $250 left. He then purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, totaling $50 in expenses. Therefore, John has $250 - $50 = $200 remaining.

John aims to deposit $100 into the bank, leaving him with $200 - $100 = $100.

To find out how many 25-dollar pens he can purchase, we can divide the amount he has left by the cost of a single pen: $100 ÷ $25 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can calculate the total number of letters in Craig's words and add the additional 50 letters from his brother's words.

Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in his words is:
20 * 15 = 300

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so we add 50 to Craig's total:
300 + 50 = 350

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 350."
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that there are 8 children in each row and 7 rows in total, we can calculate the total number of children by multiplying the number of children per row by the number of rows.

Total number of children = Number of children per row * Number of rows
Total number of children = 8 * 7
Total number of children = 56

Therefore, there are 56 children participating in the mass drill."
"To determine the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. With 29 pupils in the class, each receiving 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles distributed is:

29 pupils * 2 bottles/pupil = 58 bottles

Next, we consider the teacher's available coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher possesses 9 coupons. Therefore, the maximum number of bottles the teacher can obtain is:

9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles

Subtracting the number of bottles distributed to the students from the maximum number of bottles the teacher can obtain yields the number of bottles left for the teacher:

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"To determine the total cost of the repair, we can break down the components involved. The total cost consists of a fixed charge, labor costs, and the cost of parts.

The fixed charge is $40, which is a flat rate for the initial visit. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). Since the hourly rate is $35, which is a whole number, we can round the labor cost to the nearest whole number, which is $35.

The total labor cost is $35.

The cost of parts is given as $60.

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the fixed charge, labor cost, and cost of parts:

Total cost = Fixed charge + Labor cost + Cost of parts
Total cost = $40 + $35 + $60
Total cost = $135

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $135 for the repair.

The final answer is: $135"
"To calculate the amount James was out, we need to consider the initial cost of the CDs, the discount he received, and the amount he received from selling some of the CDs.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

Total cost of CDs = Number of CDs * Price per CD
Total cost of CDs = 10 * $15
Total cost of CDs = $150

Since James received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount James received from selling 5 CDs:

Total amount from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total amount from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total amount from selling CDs = $200

To find out how much James was out, we subtract the total amount he received from selling the CDs from the total cost of the CDs:

Amount James was out = Total cost of CDs - Total amount from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $150 - $200
Amount James was out = -$50

Since James was out $50, he actually lost $50.

The final answer is: $50"
"To determine the total amount Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we can calculate the total value of each type of crop and then sum them together.

The total value of the yams can be calculated as 6 * $1.5, which equals $9. The total value of the sweet potatoes is 10 * $2, resulting in $20. Lastly, the total value of the carrots is 4 * $1.25, which equals $5.

To find the overall total, we add these values together: $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

The final answer is: $34"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into distinct phases and calculate the time spent in each phase.

Let's denote the total distance as D, the initial swimming speed as S1, and the final swimming speed as S2. We are given that D = 20 miles, S1 = 2 miles per hour, and S2 = S1 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

Phase 1: James swims 60% of the distance at S1.
Distance covered in Phase 1 = 0.6D = 0.6 * 20 miles = 12 miles
Time spent in Phase 1 = Distance / S1 = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Phase 2: James rests for half the time spent in Phase 1.
Rest time = 0.5 * 6 hours = 3 hours

Phase 3: James swims the remaining distance at S2.
Distance covered in Phase 3 = D - Distance covered in Phase 1 = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles
Time spent in Phase 3 = Distance / S2 = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Total time = Time in Phase 1 + Rest time + Time in Phase 3
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours
Total time = 17 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be expressed as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation 7x - 40 = 70 to represent the situation. Solving for x, we get:

7x - 40 = 70
7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110
x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a loaf, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fraction of a loaf. Therefore, Sam had approximately 15 loaves of bread last Friday.

Now, we can calculate the number of loaves the bakery has by multiplying the number of loaves Sam had by 7 and subtracting 40:

Number of loaves the bakery has = 7 * 15 - 40
= 105 - 40
= 65

The bakery has 65 loaves of bread.

The final answer is 65."
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. Initially, she received 15 stickers for participating in class. However, she lost 7 stickers during playtime, resulting in a net change of -7. This can be represented as:

15 - 7 = 8

Then, her teacher gave her 5 additional stickers for helping her classmates, which can be added to the previous total:

8 + 5 = 13

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we can break down the problem into two parts: the commission earned from the New York Times and the commission earned from the Wall Street Journal.

The commission for each copy of the New York Times is 10% of the cost, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $5 = $0.50 per copy. Since Cayley sold 6 copies, the total commission from the New York Times is 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Similarly, the commission for each copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of the cost, which can be calculated as 0.08 * $15 = $1.20 per copy. Since Cayley sold 10 copies, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is 10 * $1.20 = $12.

The total commission earned by Cayley is the sum of the commissions from both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is: $15"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna. Let's denote Marcus's age as M, Leo's age as L, and Deanna's age as D.

Given that Deanna is 26 years old, we have:
D = 26

We are also given that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can write:
M = (1/2)L

Additionally, we know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, which gives us:
M = D - 5

Substituting the expression for M from the second equation into the third equation, we get:
(1/2)L = D - 5

Now, we can substitute the value of D into this equation:
(1/2)L = 26 - 5
(1/2)L = 21

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
L = 2 * 21
L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can express Bahati's score as x + 20. Given that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, we can also express Bahati's score as x + 10.

We know that the total points scored by all three individuals is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now that we have found Dinar's score, we can determine Azibo's score. Since Azibo scored 10 points less than Bahati, and Bahati scored 5 points more than Dinar, we can express Azibo's score as (x + 10) - 20. However, we can simplify this expression by substituting x = 5:

Azibo's score = (5 + 10) - 20
= 15 - 20
= -5

However, since a negative score is not possible in this context, we re-evaluate the equation. We realize that the initial setup was correct, but the interpretation of the relationship between Bahati and Azibo's scores was incorrect. Let's re-examine the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:

3x = 15

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5

Now, we can correctly determine Azibo's score. Since Azibo scored 20 points less than Bahati, and Bahati scored 5 points more than Dinar, we can express Azibo's score as (x + 10) - 20. However, we can simplify this expression by substituting x = 5:

Azibo's score = (5 + 10) - 20
= 15 - 20
= -5

This result is still incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the relationship between Bahati and Azibo's scores. We know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, and Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar. This implies that Azibo scored 10 points less than Dinar. Therefore, we can express Azibo's score as x - 10, where x is Dinar's score.

We know that the total points scored by all three individuals is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x = 45

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 15

Now that we have found Dinar's score, we can determine Azibo's score:

Azibo's score = x - 10
= 15 - 10
= 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can utilize the concept of linear density. Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick and each paper is 1 inch thick, we can calculate the number of pages by dividing the total thickness by the thickness of a single paper.

Let's denote the number of pages as 'p'. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the total thickness of the book is equivalent to the number of pages multiplied by the thickness of a single paper. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

p * 1 inch = 1.5 inches

To solve for 'p', we can divide both sides of the equation by 1 inch:

p = 1.5 inches / 1 inch
p = 1.5

Since 'p' represents the number of pages, we can conclude that the book contains 1.5 pages. However, since the number of pages must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a page.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we can utilize the concept of unit rates and multiplication. 

First, we determine the total number of minutes from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes as follows:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Next, we can calculate the number of reports stapled per minute by dividing the number of reports stapled in 15 minutes by 15:

30 reports / 15 minutes = 2 reports/minute

Now, we can multiply the total minutes by the rate of reports stapled per minute to find the total number of reports stapled:

900 minutes * 2 reports/minute = 1800 reports

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to consider the time she spent sleepwalking and her early morning wake-up time.

First, let's calculate the total minutes she slept from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.:

10 p.m. to 12 a.m. = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
12 a.m. to 2:15 a.m. = 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes
2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. = 23 minutes
2:38 a.m. to 6 a.m. = 3 hours 22 minutes = 182 minutes

Now, we add up the minutes:
120 + 135 + 23 + 182 = 460 minutes

However, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract those minutes from the total:
460 - 5 = 455 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{455}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of measuring spoons and measuring cups.

First, we need to find 2/3 of the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we can express this as a numerical value: 2 * 12 = 24 cups. Now, we can calculate 2/3 of 24 cups:

(2/3) * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

Jonathan initially has 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he is left with:

16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils he has remaining is the sum of measuring spoons and measuring cups:

24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is: 34"
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to consider the initial occupancy rate and the daily admission rate.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied, which translates to 100 occupied beds. This leaves 1000 - 100 = 900 unoccupied beds.

Given that 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is 50 * 14 = 700.

To find the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the total number of patients admitted from the initial number of unoccupied beds:

900 - 700 = 200

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 200.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we can break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we need to find the number of non-work emails. Since Robyn sends 16 emails per day and 7 of them are work emails, the number of non-work emails can be calculated as follows:

Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we are told that two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. To find the number of emails sent to family, we can calculate:

Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we need to find the number of emails sent to her boyfriend. Since one-third of the non-work emails are sent to him, we can calculate:

Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between Shawna's age and Aliya's age. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Given that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we can use the concept of percentages. Kelly's statement implies that Courtney overestimated the number of attendees by 20%. This means that the actual number of attendees is 80% of the number Courtney reported.

Let's calculate 80% of 48:

80% of 48 = 0.8 * 48
= 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls can be represented as 2x. Given that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan's balls can be represented as 2(2x) = 4x.

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation 2x = 2 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of balls carried by each individual:
Jeffrey's balls = x = 1
Jason's balls = 2x = 2
Jordan's balls = 4x = 4

The total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey:
Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as x. We know that the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes dug by the end of the third day. 

We can set up the equation: 10 + 13 + 6 + x = 4(29)

Simplifying the equation, we get: 29 + x = 116

Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get: x = 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, we can utilize the concept of equal distribution and the given information about the difference in the number of chips received by each individual.

Let's denote the number of corn chips each of Amora and Lainey received as 'x'. Since Collins received 15 more chips than the others, the number of chips Collins received can be expressed as (x + 15).

We are given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 70 + 70

Combine like terms:

2x = 140

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 70

Now that we know the number of chips each of Amora and Lainey received, we can find the number of chips Collins received:

x + 15 = 70 + 15
= 85

Now, we can calculate the total number of corn chips by adding the chips received by each individual:

Total = x + x + (x + 15)
= 70 + 70 + 85
= 225

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To determine the total cost of the travel, we can calculate the additional amount that represents a 50% increase in the cost of the supplies. 

The cost of the supplies is $400. A 50% increase can be calculated as 0.5 * $400 = $200. 

The total cost of the travel is the sum of the cost of the supplies and the additional amount, which is $400 + $200 = $600.

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each individual. Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

We can use substitution to solve for the variables. First, substitute the expression for X from equation (2) into equation (1):

A + S + (S + 5) = 339

Combine like terms:

2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the expression for S from equation (3) into the above equation:

2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339

Expand and simplify:

8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339

Combine like terms:

9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9A = 360

Divide by 9:

A = 40

Now that we have found A, we can find S by substituting A into equation (3):

S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we can utilize the concept of multiplication. Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'e' and the duration of each episode as 'd'. We are given that d = 20 and e = d / 2. Substituting the value of d into the equation for e, we get e = 20 / 2 = 10.

Now, we can calculate the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode: Total time = e * d = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can apply the concept of vector addition. The bird's displacement can be represented as the sum of three vectors: the displacement due to the initial southerly flight, the displacement due to the subsequent northerly flight, and the displacement due to the final southerly flight.

Let's denote the initial southerly displacement as vector A, the northerly displacement as vector B, and the final southerly displacement as vector C. The magnitude of each vector can be calculated as follows:

|A| = 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles
|B| = 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles
|C| = 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird's final position is the sum of the displacements, we can calculate the net displacement as the vector sum of A, B, and C. However, since B and C are in opposite directions, we can simplify the calculation by subtracting the magnitude of B from the magnitude of A and then adding the magnitude of C:

Net displacement = |A| - |B| + |C|
= 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles
= 374 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.

374"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to consider the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten during the party.

Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies, which can be expressed as 6/12 or 0.5 dozen. Her friends brought 4 dozen (48) brownies to her home. To find the total number of brownies, we can add these amounts together:

Total brownies = 12 (initial brownies) + 0.5 (additional brownies from the office party) + 48 (brownies from her friends)
= 12 + 0.5 + 48
= 60.5

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a brownie, we can round this value to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round 60.5 to 61 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. To subtract this from the total, we can express 1 1/2 dozen as 1.5 dozen or 18. 

Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 61 - 18
= 43

Therefore, Greta had 43 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the total age of the family members, we can break down the problem into individual components.

First, we know Nani's age is 8 years. Since his brother is twice his age, we can calculate his brother's age as 2 * 8 = 16 years.

Next, we need to find Nani's sister's age. Given that she is 25% younger than Nani, we can express this as an equation: sister's age = Nani's age - (25% of Nani's age). Converting the percentage to a decimal, we get 0.25 * 8 = 2 years. Therefore, the sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of all three family members: Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). To find the total age, we can add these values together: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total time required to string all 12 racquets, we can calculate the time for each type of string and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of string:

- Synthetic gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
- Polyester string: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
- Hybrid sets: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add the time for each type of string to find the total time:

Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all 12 racquets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{227}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is $600 each, so the total cost for these phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones is 3, since there are 3 phones remaining after the first two. Each of these phones is half the price of the first two, which is $300. Therefore, the total cost for the remaining phones is 3 x $300 = $900.

The total cost of all the phones is the sum of the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team as follows:

Number of players in Zeke's team = Number of players in Carlton's team + 7
= 13 + 7
= 20

Now, we can find the total number of players in both teams by adding the number of players in each team:

Total number of players = Number of players in Carlton's team + Number of players in Zeke's team
= 13 + 20
= 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats required, we must first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

P = 2(l + w)

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the length (l) is 15 feet and the width (w) is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P = 2(15 + 10)
P = 2(25)
P = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to obtain the total number of wooden slats required:

Total wooden slats = P * 2
Total wooden slats = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats = 100

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats for the fence.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we can follow a step-by-step approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of oranges she initially had: 12 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges she gave to her mom and sister: 2 boxes * 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges.

Then, we calculate the number of oranges she kept: 1/4 of 240 oranges = 60 oranges.

Now, we subtract the oranges she kept and gave away from the total to find the number of oranges she sold: 240 - 40 - 60 = 140 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 140 oranges.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the total number of states in both countries, we need to first establish the number of states in each country. The United States of America has 50 states. 

India, having more than half the number of states as the USA, can be calculated by finding half of 50 and then adding 4. Half of 50 is 25, and adding 4 yields 29 states in India.

Now, we can calculate the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8
= $39

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the amount saved from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
= $39 - $14
= $25

Given that Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can calculate the number of hours he needs to work by dividing the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours = Amount needed / Hourly wage
= $25 / $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To determine the number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of cherries Jerry has as 'x'. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry, we can express this relationship as an equation:

Robert's cherries = Jerry's cherries + 10
30 = x + 10

To solve for 'x', we can isolate the variable by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 10
x = 20

Now that we know Jerry has 20 cherries, we can calculate the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on each day, and then finding the total revenue generated from these sales.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. According to the problem, we know:

G = 10 (given)
A = G - 4
A = 10 - 4
A = 6

Now, let's calculate the number of gingerbread and apple pie boxes sold on Sunday:
G = G + 5
G = 10 + 5
G = 15
A = G - 4
A = 15 - 4
A = 11

The revenue generated from gingerbread sales on Saturday is 10 * $6 = $60, and on Sunday is 15 * $6 = $90. The revenue generated from apple pie sales on Saturday is 6 * $15 = $90, and on Sunday is 11 * $15 = $165.

The total revenue for the two days is the sum of the revenues from gingerbread and apple pie sales:
Total Revenue = ($60 + $90) + ($90 + $165)
Total Revenue = $240

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, the total number of hours she will be outside is 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours.

Given that her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed as follows:

Total sunscreen needed = Total hours outside * Amount of sunscreen reapplied per hour
Total sunscreen needed = 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour
Total sunscreen needed = 32 ounces

Since the sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide the total amount needed by the bottle size to find the number of bottles required:

Number of bottles = Total sunscreen needed / Bottle size
Number of bottles = 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle
Number of bottles = 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"To determine the prices of the two cars, we can use the concept of percentage decrease. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means its price is 60% of the blue car's price.

Let's denote the price of the blue car as B. We are given that B = $100. To find the price of the red car, we can calculate 60% of B and subtract it from B.

The price of the red car = B - (0.6B) = 0.4B

Substituting B = $100, we get:
Price of the red car = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Therefore, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Emil's current age as E, his dad's age as D, and his brother's age as B.

We are given that E = 19. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write the equation:

24 = D/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

D = 48

We are also given that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write the equation:

24 = 2B

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

B = 12

Now, we need to find the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12.

The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne had, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to establish the number of beads given by each individual. Her mother provided 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which can be expressed as 20 + 10. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother gave, which can be represented as 2 * 20.

Now, let's calculate the number of beads given by each person: 
- Her mother gave 20 beads.
- Her sister gave 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads, we add the beads given by each person: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"To determine the total number of crawfish Joe caught, we can calculate the amount he caught each day and then convert it to servings.

First, we need to find the total amount of crawfish caught. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

Now, we can find the total amount of crawfish caught by adding the amounts from each day: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7.

Therefore, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the average shoe size, we must first establish the size of Charlie's boots in relation to Sophie's. Given that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate Charlie's boot size as 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average size of the shoes is 15.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to purchase and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

First, let's convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches: 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

The cost of each flower is $6, so the total cost will be 57 * $6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother consumes half the amount of pretzels Edgar does, we can express this relationship as a ratio.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. The ratio of Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption to Edgar's daily pretzel consumption is 1:2, or 1/2. We can set up the following proportion:

x / 18 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 18

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

Now that we know Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption by multiplying this value by 7:

9 pretzels/day × 7 days/week = 63 pretzels/week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines separately and then summing the results.

The cost of petunias can be calculated as follows:

5 baskets × 3 petunias per basket × $3.00 per petunia = 5 × 3 × $3.00 = $45.00

Similarly, the cost of sweet potato vines can be calculated as:

5 baskets × 2 vines per basket × $2.50 per vine = 5 × 2 × $2.50 = $25.00

The total cost is the sum of these two values:

Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets.

The final answer is: $70.00"
"To determine the number of roses that can be planted, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract this from the total amount of soil available.

Let's denote the number of roses as 'r'. Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the total amount of soil used for roses is 'r' pounds.

We are given that 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations are planted. Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. Therefore, the total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is:

4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
Total soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds

Since the total amount of soil available is 30 pounds, we can set up the equation:

r + 27 = 30

Subtracting 27 from both sides gives us:

r = 3

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. This can be calculated as:

Monthly savings = 0.25 * $2,000 = $500

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate the number of pairs she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a single pair and then multiplying by 12:

Number of pairs per year = ($500 / $1,000) * 12
= 0.5 * 12
= 6

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the task into two components: peeling and cooking.

First, let's analyze the peeling process. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp can be calculated as follows:

Time = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp peeled per minute
Time = 90 / 6
Time = 15 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. We know that Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp, we can set up a proportion:

Cooking time for 90 shrimp / Cooking time for 30 shrimp = 90 / 30
Let x be the cooking time for 90 shrimp
x / 10 = 90 / 30
x = (90 / 30) * 10
x = 30 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by adding the peeling time and cooking time:

Total time = Peeling time + Cooking time
Total time = 15 + 30
Total time = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 45"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we can analyze the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

Let's denote the starting temperature as x. The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, resulting in a cooling effect of 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, resulting in an additional cooling effect of 4 * 3 = 12 degrees. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner, the warming effect over the 2 hours the air conditioner was off is 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.

The net cooling effect is the difference between the total cooling effect and the warming effect: 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, we can express Bill's age as 3(30 + x).

We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, and Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3(30 + x) = 90 + 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 + 3x = 165

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

3x = 75

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 25

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find Bill's age when his dad saw the comet by subtracting x from 30:

Bill's age when his dad saw the comet = 30 - 25 = 5

However, this is not the correct answer, as we are looking for Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet 75 years after his dad, we can add 75 to Bill's age when his dad saw the comet to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:

Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time = 5 + 75 = 80

The final answer is 80."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down his monthly expenses into distinct categories and calculate the total number of checks written in each category.

Buford writes a check for his electric bill once per month, resulting in 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once per month, adding another 12 checks per year. Furthermore, he writes two checks to the church per month, resulting in 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes four checks to the pest and lawn service per year, as there are four quarters in a year.

To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can sum the checks from each category: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52}$"
"To determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France, we can start by calculating the total number of flights it makes in a day. Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can establish the total number of flights made by the first plane as 44 * 2 = 88.

Given that the first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as 3/4 * 88 = 66.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France and Germany can be found by subtracting the flights to Greece from the total flights: 88 - 66 = 22.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"To determine the combined length of time for the three wolves' howls, we can analyze the problem using basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the length of Tobias' howl as T, Chikote's howl as C, and Igneous' howl as I. We are given the following information:

1. T = 20 seconds
2. C = 2T
3. I = T + C

We can substitute the value of C from equation (2) into equation (3) to find I:

I = T + 2T
I = 3T

Now, we can express I in terms of T:

I = 3(20)
I = 60 seconds

Next, we can find the combined length of time by adding the individual howls:

Combined time = T + C + I
= 20 + 40 + 60
= 120 seconds

To convert the combined time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

Combined time (minutes) = 120 / 60
= 2 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings, we can calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Let's denote the amount Adam's mother gave him as M and the amount his father gave him as 2M, since his father gave him twice as much as his mother. We know that M = $6. Therefore, the total amount Adam received from his parents is M + 2M = 3M = $6 + $12 = $18.

Now, we can calculate the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

Cost of trousers - Total amount received from parents = Amount contributed from savings
$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To determine the age of Wilfred, we can utilize the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

Given that the total age of the children is 20, we can express this as an equation: H + W + 3 + 4 = 20, where 3 and 4 represent the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, respectively.

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children, which is 4. Therefore, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5. Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we can express this as H = 2 * 5 = 10.

Now, we can substitute H = 10 into the equation H + W + 3 + 4 = 20 to solve for W:

10 + W + 3 + 4 = 20

Combine like terms:

17 + W = 20

Subtract 17 from both sides:

W = 3

The age of Wilfred is 3."
"To determine the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to calculate the total amount of money Walter has collected so far. This can be done by adding the initial contributions from his neighbors and the online fund.

The total amount collected is $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from the online fund) = $2000.

Since Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates, we can express this as 3 * (total amount collected). However, we must also account for Walter's friend's contribution of $200, which will be subtracted from the total amount collected.

The correct calculation is: 3 * ($2000 - $200) = 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer will contribute $5400.

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we can employ a straightforward division-based approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of cookies available for distribution: 100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies. Since the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church, we can calculate the number of cookies allocated to the church as follows:

Number of cookies for the church = Total cookies / 2 = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Next, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received to find the number of people in the church:

Number of people in the church = Total cookies for the church / Cookies per person = 750 / 15 = 50

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church."
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can employ a straightforward approach. Let's denote the total number of slices as 'T'. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's slice, we can express the number of slices for the adults as 2x and for the kids as x.

Given that the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation: 2x + x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

Now that we know x = 2, we can determine the number of slices for the adults (2x) and kids (x). The number of slices for the adults is 2 * 2 = 4, and the number of slices for the kids is 2.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult receives approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"To determine the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds. With 9 inpatients and 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time spent on rounds is:

9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes

Next, we calculate the time spent on appointments. With 10 appointments and 30 minutes per appointment, the total time spent on appointments is:

10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

The total time spent is the sum of the time spent on rounds and appointments:

180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

To convert the total time to hours, we divide by 60:

480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available (9 hours):

9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest start time for Jordan to make the cake, we need to consider the total time required to complete each task and add them up.

The total time required is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Let's calculate the total time in minutes:
- Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
- Time to cool the cake: 120 minutes (2 hours)
- Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes:
180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time. Since the serving time is 5:00 pm, we'll subtract 3 hours from this time.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: $\boxed{2:00 pm}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can use a simple division problem. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

7x = 64

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 64 / 7

x = 9.14 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to represent the exact value.

x ≈ 9.14

However, since the question does not provide multiple-choice options, we can express the answer as a multiple-choice question:

What is the approximate number of chocolate bars in a box?

A) 8
B) 9
C) 9.14
D) 10

Correct answer: C) 9.14"
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the total cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio can be calculated as follows:

Cost of renting the studio per week = $25 per session * 3 days = $75 per week
Cost of renting the studio per month = $75 per week * 4 weeks = $300 per month

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total cost of students' lessons per week is:

Cost of students' lessons per week = $1.50 per student * 3 sessions per week * 10 students = $45 per week
Cost of students' lessons per month = $45 per week * 4 weeks = $180 per month

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is the sum of these two values:

Total cost = Cost of renting the studio per month + Cost of students' lessons per month
Total cost = $300 + $180
Total cost = $480 per month

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x. Since Peter has 4 boxes, his total number of chocolate bars is 4x. Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes, so her total number of chocolate bars is 7x.

We are given that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation 4x = 64. Solving for x, we get x = 64 / 4 = 16.

Similarly, we can set up the equation 7x = 56 and solve for x, which also gives us x = 56 / 7 = 8.

Now, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box between Peter and Martha by subtracting the number of chocolate bars in each box of Martha from the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter: 16 - 8 = 8.

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we can employ a simple yet effective approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the female porcupine population is 3/5 of the total population, we can express this as:

Number of female porcupines = (3/5) * Total population
= (3/5) * 50
= 30

Next, we need to calculate the number of new porcupines born each month. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is:

New porcupines per month = Number of female porcupines * 4
= 30 * 4
= 120

To find the total number of new porcupines in a year, we multiply the number of new porcupines per month by 12:

New porcupines per year = New porcupines per month * 12
= 120 * 12
= 1440

Finally, we add the initial population and the new porcupines to determine the total population after a year:

Total population after a year = Initial population + New porcupines per year
= 50 + 1440
= 1490

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we can utilize the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is given by:

V = lwh

where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height (or depth, in this case).

Given the dimensions of the pool (l = 14 ft, w = 25 ft, and h = 4 ft), we can substitute these values into the formula:

V = 14 ft x 25 ft x 4 ft
V = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next. We know that 1 cubic foot is equivalent to approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, we can convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons by multiplying by 7.48:

Total gallons = V x 7.48
Total gallons = 1400 cubic feet x 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
Total gallons ≈ 10472 gallons

Now, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost ≈ 10472 gallons x $0.10/gallon
Cost ≈ $1047.20

The cost to fill the pool is approximately $1047.20."
"In this problem, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic sequence. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the number of red sticks is 9. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so we can express this as:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
= 9 + 5
= 14

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so we can express this as:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
= 14 - 3
= 11

To find the total number of sticks, we simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
= 9 + 14 + 11
= 34

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can apply the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we can find the difference in distance traveled by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo.

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into distinct categories.

First, we calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students fall into this category, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.

Next, we find the number of male students over 16, which is one-fourth of the total students over 16. This can be calculated as 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students.

Now, we calculate the number of male students under 16, which is half of the total students under 16. This is 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.

Finally, we calculate the number of female students over 16 by subtracting the number of male students over 16 from the total students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.

The total number of female students is the sum of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine the number of laps Bethany can run more than Quinn, we need to first establish the individual lap counts for each person. 

Given that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour, we can calculate the lap counts for the other individuals based on the provided relationships:

- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we can calculate the difference in lap counts between Bethany and Quinn by subtracting Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we can analyze the work done by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

Let's denote the amount of water Wanda pumps on the first day as W1 and the amount she pumps on the second day as W2. Similarly, let's denote the amount of water Ms. B pumps on the first day as B1 and the amount she pumps on the second day as B2.

We are given that Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank's capacity on the first day, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Therefore, W1 = 4500.

Ms. B pumps 3/4 as much water as Wanda on the first day, so B1 = 3/4 * W1 = 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is W2 = 2/3 * W1 = 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is B2 = 1/3 * B1 = 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is W1 + W2 + B1 + B2 = 4500 + 3000 + 3375 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can model the charge remaining as a function of time. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. This can be represented by the equation:

x - (9% * t) = x - 0.09t

where t is the time in hours.

After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - 0.09(5) = x - 0.45

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. This can be represented by the equation:

x - 0.45 - 0.07(3) = x - 0.45 - 0.21

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

x - 0.45 - 0.21 = 0.28

Combine like terms:

x - 0.66 = 0.28

Add 0.66 to both sides:

x = 0.28 + 0.66

x = 0.94

To express the initial charge as a percentage, multiply by 100:

x = 0.94 * 100

x = 94%

The final answer is: $\boxed{94}$"
"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can calculate her total weekly earnings and then divide the required savings by her weekly earnings.

Janet's total hourly wage is $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour. Her weekly earnings can be calculated as:

Weekly earnings = Total hourly wage * Hours worked per week
Weekly earnings = $25/hour * 40 hours/week
Weekly earnings = $1000/week

Now, we can calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save the down payment:

Number of weeks = Required savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $2,000 / $1000/week
Number of weeks = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has spent on other fruits and subtract it from his initial $10.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on other fruits:

3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
4 pears at $0.75 each: 4 × $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis at $1 each: 2 × $1 = $2
5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent on other fruits = $1.5 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has $10, we can find the amount of money left by subtracting the total amount spent from his initial amount:

$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

However, this result indicates that Jamaar has spent more than he has. To find the correct answer, we need to re-evaluate the calculation.

Let's re-examine the calculation:

$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

Since Jamaar cannot spend a negative amount, we can conclude that he does not have enough money to buy any plums.

Final answer: 0"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we can employ a straightforward division operation. 

First, we calculate the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs Anne kept from the total number of packs: 15 - 2 = 13.

Next, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack: 13 * 60 = 780.

Finally, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends to determine the number of pieces each friend received: 780 ÷ 10 = 78.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: $\boxed{78}$"
"To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can utilize the concept of exponential growth, where the price increase is compounded annually. The formula for exponential growth is given by:

P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t

where P(t) is the price after t years, P0 is the initial price, r is the annual growth rate (as a decimal), and t is the number of years.

In this case, the initial price (P0) is $120, the annual growth rate (r) is 5% or 0.05, and we want to find the price after 3 years (t = 3).

P(3) = 120 * (1 + 0.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * (1.05)^3
P(3) = 120 * 1.157625
P(3) ≈ 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can utilize the concept of division. Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to 8 albums, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Given that 3 albums were selfies and 2 albums were portraits, we can calculate the number of portraits and selfies as follows:

Number of portraits = 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18
Number of selfies = 3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27

Therefore, Olivia has 18 portraits and 27 selfies.

The final answer is: 18"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can establish a rate of reading as follows:

Rate = Time / Number of pages
Rate = 10 minutes / 3 pages
Rate = 3.33 minutes per page

Now, we can calculate the total time spent reading by multiplying the rate by the total number of pages read:

Total time = Rate * Number of pages
Total time = 3.33 minutes/page * 18 pages
Total time = 60 minutes

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests. After that, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, the number of guests who checked in is 2 * 15 = 30. Therefore, the total number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more guests checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday, which is triple the number he picked on Wednesday. This can be expressed as 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Next, we add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

Therefore, John has a total of 22 bananas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can calculate the proportions as follows:

Let's denote the total number of questions as Q. We know that 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is 0.4Q. The remaining questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so the number of average and difficult questions is (Q - 0.4Q) / 2 = 0.3Q.

We are given that Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 0.75 * 0.4Q = 0.3Q. She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 0.5 * 0.3Q = 0.15Q.

The total number of points Aries is sure to get is the sum of the points from easy, average, and difficult questions:
Total points = 0.3Q + 0.15Q = 0.45Q

Since we know the total number of questions is 60, we can substitute Q = 60 into the equation:
Total points = 0.45 * 60 = 27

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 27 points.

The final answer is 27."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'L' and the number of small stuffed animals sold as 'S'. We are given that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we can express the price of a large stuffed animal as 3x and the price of a small stuffed animal as x.

Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we can determine that x = 4. Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x = 3 * 4 = $12.

We are also given that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so S = 2L.

The total amount earned from the sales is $120, which can be represented by the equation: 12L + 4S = 120.

Substituting S = 2L into the equation, we get: 12L + 4(2L) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12L + 8L = 120.

Combining like terms, we get: 20L = 120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we get: L = 6.

Since S = 2L, we can find S by multiplying L by 2: S = 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in a week, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by summing the individual daily consumption of the man, his wife, and their son. 

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the total daily consumption by 7 to obtain the weekly consumption.

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine Suzanne's remaining earnings, we must first calculate her total revenue from the sale of cookies and cupcakes. 

Let's denote the number of cookies sold as C and the number of cupcakes sold as U. We are given that C = 80 and U = 60. The price of each cookie is $1, and the price of each cupcake is $4. Therefore, the total revenue from cookies is $1 * C = $1 * 80 = $80, and the total revenue from cupcakes is $4 * U = $4 * 60 = $240.

The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from cookies and cupcakes: Total Revenue = $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne then gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount she gave away is 2 * $10 = $20.

To find Suzanne's remaining earnings, we subtract the amount she gave away from her total revenue: Remaining Earnings = Total Revenue - $20 = $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can employ a straightforward subtraction approach. 

First, we need to identify the total number of eggs, the number of eggs found by the twins, and the number of eggs that were not found. 

Let's denote the total number of eggs as T, the number of eggs found by the twins as E_twins, and the number of eggs not found as E_not_found. We are given the following values:

T = 100
E_twins = 30
E_not_found = 10

To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we can use the following formula:

E_friends = T - E_twins - E_not_found

Substituting the given values, we get:

E_friends = 100 - 30 - 10
E_friends = 60

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs."
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we establish the daily ore mining capacity of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe, which is 36 pounds per day. With 40 dwarves, the collective daily mining capacity is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily capacity by the number of days in the month, which is 30. Therefore, the total ore mined in a month is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43200}$"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Given that the prices of the first two packages are $3 for 2 sandwiches and $6 for 4 sandwiches, we can establish a ratio of price to quantity.

The ratio of price to quantity for the first package is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.
The ratio of price to quantity for the second package is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

Since the prices are proportional, we can infer that the price per sandwich remains constant across all packages. Therefore, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the quantity of the third package to find its total cost.

Price per sandwich = $1.50
Quantity of the third package = 8 sandwiches
Cost of the third package = Price per sandwich * Quantity of the third package
Cost of the third package = $1.50 * 8
Cost of the third package = $12

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To determine the monthly payment, we can calculate the interest accrued on the remaining amount owed. Assuming the interest rate is 10% per annum, we can convert this to a monthly rate by dividing by 12.

Monthly interest rate = 10%/year / 12 months/year = 0.008333 (or 0.8333%)

The remaining amount owed is $2000. To calculate the monthly payment, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Monthly payment = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $2000, the rate is 0.008333, and the time is 1 month. Plugging in these values, we get:

Monthly payment = $2000 x 0.008333 x 1
Monthly payment = $16.67

Therefore, Tom has to pay $16.67 per month.

The final answer is: $16.67"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we can break down the problem into several steps.

First, we need to calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. This can be found by taking 40% of the initial number of red balloons, which is 25. The calculation is as follows:

Number of red balloons that burst = 0.4 * 25
= 10

The remaining red balloons can be found by subtracting the number of burst balloons from the initial number:

Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10
= 15

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released when Sally accidentally dropped half of them. This can be found by dividing the initial number of yellow balloons by 2:

Number of yellow balloons released = 12 / 2
= 6

The remaining yellow balloons can be found by subtracting the number released from the initial number:

Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6
= 6

Now, we need to calculate the number of blue balloons added to Sally's collection. This can be found by taking 75% of the initial number of blue balloons, which is 8. The calculation is as follows:

Number of blue balloons added = 0.75 * 8
= 6

Finally, we can find the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school by adding the remaining red, yellow, and blue balloons:

Total number of balloons = Remaining red balloons + Remaining yellow balloons + Blue balloons added
= 15 + 6 + 6
= 27

Therefore, Sally carried 27 balloons into the school."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can employ the concept of complementary probability. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events: (1) the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, and (2) the substitute teacher comes in.

Let's calculate the probability of each event:

P(normal teacher doesn't give an extension) = 0.5 (probability of a normal teacher) * 0.6 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.3
P(substitute teacher comes in) = 0.5 (probability of a substitute teacher) * 0.6 (probability of not getting an extension) = 0.3

Since these events are mutually exclusive, we add their probabilities: P(not having to turn in homework) = 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6

Now, we can find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by subtracting the probability of not having to turn in homework from 1: P(having to turn in homework) = 1 - P(not having to turn in homework) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: P(having to turn in homework) = 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: $\boxed{40\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to calculate the remaining seats available after accounting for the allocated seats for graduates and faculty. This can be achieved by subtracting the total number of allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center.

Let's denote the total capacity as C, the number of seats allocated for graduates as G, and the number of seats allocated for faculty as F. We are given that C = 6000, G = 950, and F = 300.

First, we calculate the total number of seats allocated:
Total allocated seats = G + F = 950 + 300 = 1250

Next, we subtract the total allocated seats from the total capacity to find the remaining seats:
Remaining seats = C - Total allocated seats = 6000 - 1250 = 4750

Now, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive:
Tickets per graduate = Remaining seats ÷ Number of graduates = 4750 ÷ 950

Tickets per graduate = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we can employ a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the number of large beans as L, the number of medium beans as M, and the number of small beans as S. We are given the following relationships:

1. L = 75 (since it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up)
2. M = 2L (since Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans)
3. S = M/3 (since eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean)

Using the first two equations, we can express M in terms of L:

M = 2L
M = 2(75)
M = 150

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the third equation to find S:

S = M/3
S = 150/3
S = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate Melissa's hourly wage after expenses, we can employ the concept of total compensation and hourly rate. 

First, we need to determine her total daily income after deducting the parking expenses. This can be calculated as follows:

Daily income - Parking expenses = $15 - $3 = $12

Since she works for 3 consecutive days, her total income after expenses can be calculated as:

$12 * 3 = $36

Now, we can calculate her hourly wage by dividing the total income after expenses by the total number of hours worked:

$36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour

Therefore, Melissa's hourly wage after expenses is $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we can employ the concept of arithmetic addition. 

First, we calculate the cost of the books: 3 books at 16 dollars each is equivalent to 3 × 16 = 48 dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils: 3 pencils at 6 dollars each is equivalent to 3 × 6 = 18 dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the books and pencils together: 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since Richard places a bottle of soda every 3 feet and his driveway is 24 feet wide, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

Number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between bottles
= 24 feet / 3 feet per bottle
= 8 bottles

As Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. Given that it takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, the total time can be calculated as:

Total time = Number of moves * Time per move
= 7 moves * 5 seconds per move
= 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

35"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that there are 40 apples in one box and he has two boxes, the total number of apples is 40 * 2 = 80.

Since each pack contains 8 apples, we can calculate the number of packs by dividing the total number of apples by 8:

Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples per pack
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To determine the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchased and subtract it from her initial amount of $50.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and Amor bought 2 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $11 = $22. The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, resulting in a total cost of 3 * $6 = $18. 

The total cost of the cheese is $22 + $18 = $40. To find out how much Amor has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the present value of the lost income and the total amount of loans. We can use the formula for present value of an annuity to calculate the present value of the lost income:

PV = PMT x [(1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r]

where:
PV = present value
PMT = annual lost income = $25,000
r = annual interest rate (assuming 0% for simplicity, as the interest rate is not provided)
n = number of years = 4

PV = $25,000 x [(1 - (1 + 0)^(-4)) / 0]
PV = $25,000 x [(1 - 1) / 0]
PV = $0 (since the formula is undefined when r = 0)

Since the present value of the lost income is $0, we only need to consider the total amount of loans:

Total amount of loans = $200,000

To find the break-even point, we can divide the total amount of loans by the new annual income:

Break-even point = Total amount of loans / New annual income
Break-even point = $200,000 / $75,000
Break-even point = 2.67 years

Therefore, it would take Jim approximately 2.67 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.67}$"
"To determine the total amount of fabric required for the comforter, we must first calculate the area of the comforter. Given that the comforter's dimensions are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we can calculate the dimensions as follows:

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Adding 2 feet to both the length and width, we obtain the comforter's dimensions:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

The area of the comforter can be calculated using the formula for area:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is composed of two identical pieces, we must multiply the area by 2 to account for both pieces:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we can break down the problem into three parts.

First, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. Since the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery, we can express this as:

Tuesday's delivery = (1/5) × Monday's delivery + 17
= (1/5) × 425 + 17
= 85 + 17
= 102

Next, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday. The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. We can express this as:

Wednesday's delivery = 2 × Tuesday's delivery + 5
= 2 × 102 + 5
= 204 + 5
= 209

Now, we can find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday by adding the individual daily deliveries:

Total delivery = Monday's delivery + Tuesday's delivery + Wednesday's delivery
= 425 + 102 + 209
= 736

The final answer is: $\boxed{736}$"
"To determine the total cost of the catering, we can calculate the cost of each type of salad separately and then sum them.

The total amount Molly will pay is $65 + $36 = $101.

The final answer is: $101"
"To determine the average amount lost, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total amount lost and then dividing it by the number of races.

Let's denote the amount lost in the first race as L1, the amount won in the second race as W2, and the amount lost in the third race as L3. We are given the following information:

L1 = $5
W2 = 2L1 + $1
L3 = 1.5W2

First, we can calculate W2:
W2 = 2L1 + $1
= 2($5) + $1
= $10 + $1
= $11

Next, we can calculate L3:
L3 = 1.5W2
= 1.5($11)
= $16.5

Now, we can calculate the total amount lost:
Total amount lost = L1 + L3
= $5 + $16.5
= $21.5

Finally, we can calculate the average amount lost:
Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."
"To determine the total population of South America, we can employ a straightforward calculation based on the given information. 

We are told that there are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities with a population of 1000 people. To find the total population, we can multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country and then multiply that result by the population of each city.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Total population = Number of countries × Number of cities per country × Population per city
Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000

Performing the multiplication, we get:

Total population = 26 × 5 × 1000
Total population = 130,000

Therefore, the total population of South America is 130,000 people.

The final answer is: 130,000"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, we can calculate their individual heights and then find the absolute difference.

Xavier's height increase is 3 inches, and his initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. Therefore, his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches.

Cole's height increase is 2 inches, and his initial height was 50 inches. Therefore, his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier can be calculated as |52 - 51| = 1 inch.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the share of the first person, we can utilize a system of linear equations. Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Therefore, the first person's share is $586.67.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To determine the total hours worked by each painter, we can employ the concept of total work and division. The total work can be calculated by multiplying the number of days worked (21 days) by the fraction of the day worked (3/8) and then converting the result to hours.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by the team:
Total hours = (21 days) * (3/8) * (24 hours/day) = 189 hours

Since there are 4 painters, we can divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find the hours worked by each painter:
Hours per painter = Total hours / Number of painters
= 189 hours / 4
= 47.25 hours

Therefore, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The final answer is 47.25."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. 

The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, and in the third set is x/2. The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expanding and combining like terms, we get:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

A = P(1 - r)^n

where:
A = final value
P = initial value ($20,000)
r = annual depreciation rate (21% or 0.21)
n = number of years (3, since we're calculating from 2007 to 2010)

A = 20,000(1 - 0.21)^3
A = 20,000(0.79)^3
A = 20,000(0.631441)
A = 12,688.82

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately $12,688.82.

12,688.82"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the proportion of books written in languages other than English and German.

Given that half of the books are written in English and 10% are written in German, we can calculate the proportion of books written in these languages as follows:

Number of English books = 50 * 0.5 = 25
Number of German books = 50 * 0.1 = 5

Since the remaining books are written in Spanish, we can calculate the number of Spanish books by subtracting the total number of English and German books from the total number of books:

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - (Number of English books + Number of German books)
= 50 - (25 + 5)
= 50 - 30
= 20

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

The final answer is 20."

"To determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can utilize the concept of unit conversion. Given that there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days by multiplying her daily consumption (8 cups) by the number of days (30) and then converting the result to gallons.

Let's perform the calculation:

Total cups = 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we can convert the total cups to gallons by dividing by 16:

Total gallons = Total cups / 16
= 240 cups / 16
= 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can analyze the sequence of events as follows:

Initially, the train has 120 passengers. At the first stop, 20 more people board, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140. 

At the second stop, 50 people disembark, and 100 people board, resulting in a net increase of 50 people. Therefore, the total becomes 140 + 50 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people disembark, leading to a decrease of 80 people. Thus, the final total is 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

"To determine the total cost of the athletic gear, we can break down the costs of each item and calculate the total.

The cost of the tank top is $10. The cost of the running shorts is $5 more than the tank top, so it is $10 + $5 = $15. The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price, which is $48 / 2 = $24. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison has a coupon for $2 off, so the final cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."
"To determine the total cost of the tiles, we can use the formula for calculating the total cost, which is the product of the total number of tiles and the cost per tile.

Let's denote the total area of the kitchen floor as A (200 square feet) and the cost per tile as C ($12). Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft, its area is 1 square foot. 

The total number of tiles required can be calculated as:
Total Number of Tiles = Total Area / Area per Tile
Total Number of Tiles = A / 1
Total Number of Tiles = 200 / 1
Total Number of Tiles = 200

Now, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of tiles by the cost per tile:
Total Cost = Total Number of Tiles * Cost per Tile
Total Cost = 200 * $12
Total Cost = $2400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor will be $2400."
"To calculate James' yearly insurance cost, we can start by finding the increased monthly cost due to the accident. The normal monthly cost is $120, and the increase is 60% of this amount.

The increase can be calculated as 0.6 × $120 = $72.

To find the total monthly cost, we add the increase to the normal cost: $120 + $72 = $192.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly cost by 12 to find the yearly cost: $192 × 12 = $2304.

Therefore, James' yearly insurance cost is $2304."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of loads for twin beds and the number of loads for the king bed.

First, we calculate the total number of twin loads per year: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads. Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, we divide the total number of twin loads by 2 to find the number of loads per week: 208 / 2 = 104 twin loads per week. Then, we multiply this by 52 weeks to find the total number of twin loads per year: 104 * 52 = 5412 twin loads per year.

Next, we calculate the total number of king loads per year: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads per year. Since the laundry machine can wash 1 king set at a time, the number of king loads per week is equal to the number of king loads per year, which is 52. We then multiply this by 52 weeks to find the total number of king loads per year: 52 * 52 = 2704 king loads per year.

Finally, we add the total number of twin loads per year and the total number of king loads per year to find the overall number of loads per year: 5412 + 2704 = 8116 loads per year.

The final answer is: 8116"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched on both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies per week. Since there are 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched on Saturday is 4 * 4 = 16 movies.

On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies per week. For 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched on Sunday is 2 * 4 = 8 movies.

The total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is 16 + 8 = 24 movies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. 

First, we establish the initial number of stickers Leo had two years ago, which is 100. Then, we calculate the number of stickers he collected last year, which is 50. 

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, so we can express this as 2 * 50 = 100. 

Now, we add the stickers from the three years: 100 + 50 + 100 = 250.

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can use a simple division operation. 

Let's calculate the number of days the cat food will last:

Total cat food available = 720 grams
Daily cat food consumption = 60 grams

Number of days = Total cat food available / Daily cat food consumption
= 720 grams / 60 grams/day
= 12 days

Therefore, the cat food will last for 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Given that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, we can represent Silvia's slices as 2x.

We are also given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we have found Jake's slices, we can determine Silvia's slices by multiplying Jake's slices by 2:

Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2(7)
Silvia's slices = 14

With the number of slices each person ate, we can calculate the total number of slices they ate:

Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = 4x + 3
Total slices = 4(7) + 3
Total slices = 28 + 3
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to break down the costs associated with the services provided. 

First, we calculate the cost of the visit, taking into account the hourly rate and the duration of the visit. The visit is 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. The hourly rate is $300, so the cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

Next, we calculate the cost of the painkillers. The cost per pill is $4, and Hannah requires 30 pills. Therefore, the total cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

We also need to consider the cost of parking, which is $6/hour and is mandatory for a minimum of 2 hours. Therefore, the cost of parking is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, we add the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking to find the total cost of the doctor's visit. The total cost is $200 (cast) + $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To determine the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can calculate the total number of emails he responds to per day and then multiply it by 5.

First, we need to find the number of emails that require a response. Since 20% of the emails James receives don't require a response, we can calculate this as 0.2 * 80 = 16 emails.

The number of emails that require a response is 80 - 16 = 64.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, we can multiply this by 5 to find the total number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week: 64 * 5 = 320.

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we can utilize the concept of arithmetic series. The number of classes that visited each day can be represented as an arithmetic sequence: 32, 64, 96, 30, 25.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term.

In this case, we have 5 terms (n = 5), a1 = 32, and an = 25. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 5/2 * (32 + 25)
S = 2.5 * 57
S = 142.5

However, since the number of classes cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 142.

The final answer is: $\boxed{142}$"
"To calculate the average score, we can utilize the formula for the mean, which is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, we have four scores: 100, 100, 100, and 80.

The sum of these scores is 380. To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 4.

Average = (100 + 100 + 100 + 80) / 4

Average = 380 / 4

Average = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the four tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas consumed by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club consumed 70% of 20 pizzas, which can be calculated as 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team consumed 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas consumed is the sum of the pizzas consumed by the glee club and the football team, which is 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

Therefore, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total cost of postage, we can calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon separately and then sum the results.

Let's denote the number of small coupons as S and the number of big coupons as B. We are given that S = 700 and B = 2S = 1400.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 5 cents per coupon, so the total cost for small coupons is 5S cents. Similarly, the cost of mailing big coupons is 15 cents per coupon, so the total cost for big coupons is 15B cents.

The total cost of postage is the sum of the costs for small and big coupons: 5S + 15B.

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total cost = 5(700) + 15(1400)
= 3500 + 21000
= 26200 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100:

Total cost = 26200 / 100
= 262 dollars

Therefore, Anthony will spend $262 on postage.

The final answer is: $262"
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark then ate 4 of these sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. The number of meatballs in these remaining sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6. The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser and multiply it by the amount each truck carried.

Given that 20 trucks were dispatched, and a quarter of them experienced mechanical failures, we can calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser as follows:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Number of trucks that delivered = Total trucks - Trucks that could not deliver
= 20 - 5
= 15

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:

Total fertiliser delivered = Number of trucks that delivered * Amount per truck
= 15 * 20
= 300 tons

Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To determine the total cost of the butter, we can apply the concept of a discount to the total amount of butter needed. Since Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, which translates to 6 pounds of butter, and the store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off, we can model this as a two-step process.

First, we calculate the total cost without the discount: 6 pounds of butter at $4.00 per pound will be 6 * $4.00 = $24.00.

Next, we apply the discount. Since the promotion offers one pound of butter for free with every two pounds purchased, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds. This yields 3 groups.

The cost of 3 groups of butter at $4.00 per pound is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00. Since the third group is free, we subtract the cost of the first two groups from the total cost: $24.00 - $12.00 = $12.00.

The final answer is: $12.00"
"To determine the total cost of the party, we need to calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. 

The total number of guests is the sum of Kayla's classmates, the girls from her dance class, and her family members, minus the number of people who declined the invitation. 

Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined) = 41

Since the initial fee is $125 for 20 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests. 

Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21

Cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126

Total cost = $125 (initial fee) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The final answer is: $251"
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding the initial amount of money Maggie and Riza had. Since they each had $60, the total amount of money they had is $60 + $60 = $120.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4 of $60. We can express this as a mathematical expression: (1/4) × 60. To calculate this, we multiply 1/4 by 60, which is equivalent to 0.25 × 60 = 15.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3 of $60. We can express this as a mathematical expression: (1/3) × 60. To calculate this, we multiply 1/3 by 60, which is equivalent to 0.33 × 60 = 20.

The total amount of money they spent is 15 + 20 = 35.

To find out how much money they have left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $120 - $35 = $85.

The final amount of money they have left is $85."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. 

Let's denote the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey as x. Since the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey is x + 4. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 7 times the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey: 7(x + x + 4). 

We know that the total number of bananas is 315, so we can set up the equation: 7(x + x + 4) = 315.

Simplifying the equation, we get 14x + 28 = 315. Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get 14x = 287. Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 20.67.

Since the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey must be a whole number, we can round down to 20 bananas per day for the first monkey. 

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 20 + 4 = 24 bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a day is 20 + 24 = 44 bananas. 

The number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a day is 315 - 44 = 271 bananas. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats 271 / 7 = 38.71 bananas per day.

However, since the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey must be a whole number, we can round down to 38 bananas per day.

The final answer is 38."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half of the 500-piece puzzle and the second 500-piece puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle, he completed 250 pieces. 

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

The total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is the sum of the pieces from both puzzles: 250 + 500 = 750.

Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750.

Final answer: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the number of quarters Jenny will leave with, we need to calculate the total cost of the roses and subtract that from the amount of money she has.

The cost of 15 roses can be calculated in two ways:

1. As a whole number of dozens: 15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
   1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

2. As individual roses: 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30

Since Jenny has $25, she doesn't have enough money to pay for the roses. However, we can calculate the change she would receive if she paid with a combination of dollars and quarters.

Let's assume she pays with 5 dollars and some quarters. The remaining amount she needs to pay is $30 - $5 = $25.

Since a quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters she needs to pay the remaining amount as follows:

$25 / $0.25 = 100 quarters

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that she is paying with 5 dollars and some quarters. Let's recalculate the number of quarters she needs to pay the remaining amount:

$25 - $5 = $20

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we can break down the problem into manageable intervals. 

First, we need to calculate the time between each train's arrival and departure. 

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we can use a simple division problem. Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the total number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10).

Let's perform the calculation:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we can calculate the difference between the original price and the selling price, then express it as a percentage of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as P. Since Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, the sale price is 0.75P. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 0.75P = 0.9P.

The discount is the difference between the original price and the selling price, which is P - 0.9P = 0.1P. To express this as a percentage of the original price, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (0.1P / P) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can employ the concept of exponential growth. Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish creation is constant.

Let's denote the rate of jellyfish creation per hour by one spring as r jellyfish/hour. We know that r = 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

Now, we can model the growth of jellyfish using the exponential growth formula: N(t) = N0 * e^(rt), where N(t) is the number of jellyfish at time t, N0 is the initial number of jellyfish, and r is the growth rate.

In this case, N0 = 0 (since no jellyfish exist initially), and we want to find N(4), the number of jellyfish after 4 hours. We can rewrite the formula as N(4) = e^(4r).

Substituting the value of r, we get N(4) = e^(4*3600) = e^14400.

Using a calculator, we can approximate the value of e^14400 ≈ 2.01 × 10^10.

Since there are 5 springs working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours is 5 * N(4) ≈ 5 * 2.01 × 10^10 ≈ 1.005 × 10^11 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create approximately 1.005 × 10^11 jellyfish in 4 hours.

1.005 × 10^11"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Binkie's score as 'B' and Frankie's score as 'F'. According to the problem, Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's. This relationship can be expressed as:

F = 2B + 15

We are given that Binkie's score is 90. Substituting this value into the equation, we can solve for Frankie's score:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we can break down the problem into two parts: the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.

Since James walked halfway to the store, the distance to the store is 2 miles. Given his speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk to the store using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 0.5 hours

Since James walked back home, the total distance is 2 miles (to the store) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles. Again, using the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

The total time it took James to reach the store is the sum of the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home:

Total Time = 0.5 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 1.5 hours

Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1.5 hours.

"To determine the amount of money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can calculate the total cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas and compare it to the total cost of buying 40 individual bananas.

The cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

The cost of buying 40 individual bananas is 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

To find the amount of money saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can approach the problem algebraically. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as x. Since Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtracting 60 from both sides yields:

2x = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam's share, we can calculate the amount left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can utilize the concept of linear growth. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can establish a growth rate of 2 inches per year.

The formula for linear growth is:

Total growth = growth rate × number of years

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total growth = 2 inches/year × 13 years
Total growth = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine Marcel's total earnings from selling bicycles, we can break down the problem into manageable components. Let's start by calculating the number of each type of bike sold.

First, we know that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes in the month. We also know that half of these bikes were Trekking bikes, which can be represented as 0.5 * 300 = 150 bikes. Additionally, 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes, which can be calculated as 0.15 * 300 = 45 bikes. The remaining bikes were MTB, which can be found by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total: 300 - (150 + 45) = 105 bikes.

Now, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of each type of bike by its respective price and summing the results.

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Therefore, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during the month.

The final answer is: $131,250"
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, while the truck collects 3 bales per hour. 

Let's calculate the net change in bales per hour: 5 (bales produced) - 3 (bales collected) = 2 bales per hour.

Since the farmer and the truck operate for 6 hours, the total change in bales over this period is 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales.

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class and add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday.

First, we calculate the total minutes John spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of exponential decay. Given that the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height with each bounce, we can model this situation using the formula for exponential decay:

h(t) = h0 * (2/3)^t

where h(t) is the height at time t, h0 is the initial height, and t is the number of bounces.

In this case, the initial height (h0) is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 72 feet (3 * 24 feet per story). We want to find the height after the second bounce, so t = 2.

h(2) = 72 * (2/3)^2
h(2) = 72 * (4/9)
h(2) = 32 feet

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the height of the first child as H1, the height of the second child as H2, the height of the third child as H3, and the height of the fourth child as H4.

We are given the following information:

H1 = 6 feet = 72 inches
H2 = H1 + 2 inches
H3 = H2 - 5 inches
H4 = H3 + 3 inches

We can substitute the values of H1 and H2 into the equations for H3 and H4:

H3 = (H1 + 2) - 5
H3 = 72 + 2 - 5
H3 = 69 inches

H4 = H3 + 3
H4 = 69 + 3
H4 = 72 inches

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To determine the total earnings of the apple orchard, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples in bags of 10, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Since each bag is sold at $5, the total earnings can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag
= 200 bags * $5
= $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000."
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we can work backwards through the sequence of events.

Let's denote the initial amount of meat as x kilograms. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of this amount, leaving x/2 kilograms. A pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of this remaining amount, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms. Finally, a group of Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

Final answer: 1080"
"To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area to be painted and then divide it by the coverage rate of a single gallon of paint.

The north and south walls are 10 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 feet in length and 8 feet in width, so their combined area is 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total area by the coverage rate: 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

The cost of the paint is the product of the number of gallons and the cost per gallon, which is 12 * $12 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we can model this scenario using conditional probability. Let's break down the events:

1. Initially, there are 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 11 sodas. Her brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas.

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas. The friend can choose from 8 sodas. We want to find the probability that the friend gets a shaken can.

The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/8. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/8) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the distance between the two trains, we can apply the concept of relative motion. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we can add their individual distances traveled to find the total distance between them.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the speed of the second train as v2 = 0.5v1 = 30 miles per hour. The time elapsed is t = 3 hours.

The distance traveled by the first train is given by d1 = v1t = (60 miles/hour)(3 hours) = 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the second train is given by d2 = v2t = (30 miles/hour)(3 hours) = 90 miles.

The total distance between the two trains is the sum of their individual distances:
d_total = d1 + d2 = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the total number of people Billy can help, we need to calculate the number of days he is available to work and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

Given that there are 31 days in March and Billy takes 20% of the days off, we can calculate the number of days he is available to work as follows:

Number of days available = Total number of days in March - Number of days taken off
= 31 - (20% of 31)
= 31 - (0.2 * 31)
= 31 - 6.2
= 24.8

Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 24 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to work (24) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

Total number of people helped = 24 * 6
= 24 * 6
= 144

Therefore, Billy can help 144 people.

Final answer: 144"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the number of individuals accommodated by the vehicles and subtracting this from the total number of attendees.

Let's denote the number of buses as B and the number of cars as C. We are given that B = 12 and C = 20. Each bus can accommodate 35 people, and each car can accommodate 3 people. Therefore, the total number of people can be represented as:

Total people = (B * 35) + (C * 3)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Total people = (12 * 35) + (20 * 3)
= 420 + 60
= 480

This calculation yields a total of 480 people."
"To determine Jeff's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Jeff's age as J, Martha's age as M, and Mike's age as K.

Given that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can express this relationship as:

M = K - 4

We are also given that Mike is 24 years old, so we can substitute K = 24 into the equation:

M = 24 - 4
M = 20

Now, we know Martha's age is 20. Additionally, we are told that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can express Jeff's age as:

J = M + 10
J = 20 + 10
J = 30

Thus, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is 30."
"To determine the time it takes to ride each waterslide, we can apply the formula: time = distance / speed.

For the biggest slide, the time taken is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide, the time taken is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

The difference in time between the two slides can be calculated as follows: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

"To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks per day, we can calculate the total minutes and then convert it to hours.

First, we calculate the total minutes spent on lunch and breaks per day: 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour.

To find the total time spent on lunch and breaks over 5 days, we multiply the total time per day by 5: 1 hour * 5 = 5 hours.

"To determine the distance run by Ahito, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as 'x'. We know that the total distance run by all three individuals is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles. Additionally, Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber.

We can set up the following equation:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance run by Amber, we can rewrite the equation as:

8 + 3.5A + x = 52

We also know that A = 8 (Amber's distance). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

8 + 3.5(8) + x = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 28 + x = 52

Combine like terms:

36 + x = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

x = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts.

First, we'll calculate the discount on the frying pan: 20% of $20.00 is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Next, we'll calculate the discount on the set of towels: 10% of $30.00 is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, we'll calculate the total cost of the items purchased: $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be $85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00, and then $70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, which means the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15. The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue, so the number of small jellyfish is x - x/5 = 4x/5.

We are given that 6 jellyfish changed color, which implies that the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 15, we get:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can utilize the given information to establish a linear relationship between the ages of Chris, Ben, and Caroline. 

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We are given the following information:

1. Chris is 4 years old, so C = 4.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so B = 2C.
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so A = 3B.

Substituting the value of C into the equation B = 2C, we get B = 2(4) = 8.

Now, substituting the value of B into the equation A = 3B, we get A = 3(8) = 24.

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses. 

First, let's calculate her annual savings and expenses. Lauren saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year. She plans to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $40,000 per year.

Since Lauren's current salary is $100,000, her annual expenses are $40,000. Her annual savings are $20,000. 

To find out how much she saves each year, we can calculate the difference between her income and expenses: $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000. However, this is not the correct answer. We need to calculate the amount she saves each year, which is $20,000.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year. The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. It seems there might be a mistake in the question. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Since Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is still a negative number. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of successive divisions. 

First, we divide the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4): 100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm per part.

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be divided into (5): 25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut.

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can express this as a decimal: 0.4. Let's denote the total number of students as x. We are given that 0.4x = 240.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we have the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"To determine the total amount spent by the individual, we can apply basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we add the cost of the pots and the cost of the soil: $19 + $26 = $45. Then, we subtract the coupon value from the total: $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the total amount spent by the individual is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the average height of heels at the party, we can use the formula for the mean:

Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)

In this case, the sum of all values is the total height of all heels, and the number of values is the total number of heels.

Let's calculate the total height of all heels:

Total height of 4-inch heels: 3 x 4 = 12 inches
Total height of 2-inch heels: 3 x 2 = 6 inches
Total height of all heels: 12 + 6 = 18 inches

Now, we can calculate the mean:

Mean = (18) / (6)
Mean = 3 inches

Therefore, the average height of heels at the party is 3 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can calculate the difference between the total miles she aims to hike (9,300) and the miles she plans to hike per day (125). 

First, we'll calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30. Then, we can divide the total miles by the number of days to find the required daily miles.

Total miles = 9,300
Total days in June = 30

Required daily miles = Total miles / Total days
= 9,300 / 30
= 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we can find the additional miles she needs to hike per day by subtracting the planned miles from the required miles.

Additional miles per day = Required daily miles - Planned daily miles
= 310 - 125
= 185 miles per day

Therefore, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: $\boxed{185}$"
"To determine the total amount the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from each color of balls and sum them up.

The store has 3 red balls at $9 each, 11 blue balls at $5 each, and 25 green balls at $3 each. We can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total Revenue = (3 * $9) + (11 * $5) + (25 * $3)
Total Revenue = $27 + $55 + $75
Total Revenue = $157

Therefore, the store will receive a total of $157 after selling all the balls.

The final answer is: $157"
"To determine the amount of apples left for Jacques, we first need to calculate the total amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul. 

Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples, which can be calculated as (1/4) * 12 kg = 3 kg.

Paul wants 1/3 of the total apples, which can be calculated as (1/3) * 12 kg = 4 kg.

The combined amount of apples taken by Pierre and Paul is 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg.

Since the total amount of apples initially available is 12 kg, the amount left for Jacques is 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the temperature in the morning, we can apply basic arithmetic operations to the given information. 

The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius, and it dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. This means the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. 

Then, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. Therefore, the temperature in the morning can be calculated as follows:

Temperature in the morning = Initial temperature - Drop in temperature + Increase in temperature
= 2 - 8 + 3
= -3 degrees Celsius

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"To determine the amount of money Raymond has left, we can apply the principle of subtraction. Initially, Raymond had $21. He then added $11 to his initial amount, resulting in a total of $21 + $11 = $32. After purchasing a comic book for $5, his new total is $32 - $5 = $27. Finally, he spent $19 on a puzzle, leaving him with $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

"To determine the cost of each book, we can start by calculating the total amount Anna spent on the books. We know that she had a budget of $16 and spent $4 initially, leaving her with $16 - $4 = $12. However, this $4 is not spent on the books, so we need to subtract the $2 she spent on the books from the remaining amount. 

Let's denote the cost of each book as x. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x. We know that the total amount she had left after buying the books is $2, so we can set up the equation:

$12 - 2x = $2

To solve for x, we can add 2x to both sides of the equation:

$12 = 2x + 2

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

$10 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

x = $5

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the concept of percentage increase. A 20% increase in enrollment means that the number of students this year is 120% of the number of students last year.

Let's denote the number of students last year as x. The number of students this year can be represented as 1.20x.

Given that the number of students last year was 50, we can set up the equation:

1.20x = 50

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

x = 50 / 1.20
x = 41.67

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we can round x to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to represent the number of students last year as 41.67, as the actual number of students is likely to be a whole number.

Now, we can calculate the number of students this year by multiplying the number of students last year by 1.20:

Number of students this year = 1.20 * 41.67
= 50

However, this calculation is incorrect, as it results in the same number as last year. The correct calculation should be:

Number of students this year = 1.20 * 50
= 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The correct answer is: 60"
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can utilize the concept of rate and time. The given information states that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can express this as a rate of blinks per minute:

Rate = Number of blinks / Time = 255 blinks / 5 minutes = 51 blinks/minute

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times:

Time = Number of blinks / Rate = 459 blinks / (255 blinks/minute)

Time = 459 / 255
Time = 1.8 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 1.8 minutes to blink 459 times."
"To determine the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish, we can calculate the total number of each type of fish after Tate's purchase.

Initially, there were 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. Tate then acquired 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

The total number of male guppies is the sum of the initial number and the number acquired: 4 + 2 = 6.

The total number of female guppies is the sum of the initial number and the number acquired: 7 + 1 = 8.

The total number of male goldfishes is the sum of the initial number and the number acquired: 3 + 2 = 5.

The total number of female goldfishes is the sum of the initial number and the number acquired: 5 + 3 = 8.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16, and 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11.

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

A = 4 hours
M = A + 2
D = A + 4 + 4 (since Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, and Amalia took 4 hours)

We can substitute the value of A into the equations for M and D:

M = 4 + 2 = 6 hours
D = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 hours

Now, we can calculate the total time taken by adding the individual times:

Total time = A + M + D
= 4 + 6 + 12
= 22 hours

Therefore, the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores is 22 hours."
"To determine the total distance driven by John in a month, we can employ the concept of round-trip distance. Given that the one-way distance is 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph, we can calculate the total round-trip distance as follows:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 70 mph × 2 hours
= 140 miles

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:

Total Distance = 2 × 140 miles
= 280 miles

Therefore, John drives a total of 280 miles in a month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{280}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can utilize the concept of proportional relationships. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, we can establish a proportion to find Brian's daily walking distance.

Let's denote Brian's daily walking distance as x miles. According to the given information, Sofie walks 10 miles per day, which is twice Brian's daily distance. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

10 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 10 / 2
x = 5

Now that we know Brian's daily walking distance, we can calculate the total distance he walks in 7 days by multiplying his daily distance by 7:

Distance = 5 miles/day * 7 days
Distance = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days."
"To determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker, we can start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers. 

Let's denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as x. The total number of toys produced by all five workers is 400. We can set up the following equation:

2(6)(10) + 2(4)(10) + x(10) = 400

Simplifying the equation, we get:

120 + 80 + 10x = 400

Combine like terms:

200 + 10x = 400

Subtract 200 from both sides:

10x = 200

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 20

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we can calculate the weight of each dog and then add them together.

Given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's dogs as follows:

Let's denote Kory's dog weight as K and Elijah's first dog weight as E1, and Elijah's second dog weight as E2. We are given that E1 = (1/4)K and E2 = (1/2)K.

We can express the total weight of Elijah's dogs as E1 + E2 = (1/4)K + (1/2)K.

Since K = 60 pounds, we can substitute this value into the equation: 
E1 + E2 = (1/4)(60) + (1/2)(60)
E1 + E2 = 15 + 30
E1 + E2 = 45

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, utilizing basic arithmetic operations and logical deductions.

Let's denote the initial number of stickers Seth had as 'x'. Since Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, Luis received x/2 stickers.

It is given that Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the remaining half to Kris. Therefore, Kris received x/4 stickers.

We are also given that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. This implies that Kris initially had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.

Since Kris received x/4 stickers, we can set up the equation: x/4 = 16.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4, yielding x = 64.

Therefore, Seth initially had 64 stickers.

The final answer is: 64"
"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's in the large bags and then divide that by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Given that each large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 30 M&M's per ounce, the total number of M&M's in each large bag is:

10 ounces/bag * 30 M&M's/ounce = 300 M&M's/bag

Since John buys 3 large bags, the total number of M&M's is:

3 bags * 300 M&M's/bag = 900 M&M's

Now, we can divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag (10) to find the number of small bags:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
= 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
= 90

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M's.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can employ the concept of circumference and division.

The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find the distance Alfie needs to fly, we calculate half of the earth's circumference:

Distance = (1/2) × Circumference
= (1/2) × 40,000 km
= 20,000 km

Now, we can divide the distance Alfie needs to fly by his daily distance to find the number of days it will take him to fly that distance:

Number of days = Distance / Daily distance
= 20,000 km / 400 km
= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the speed of the faster car, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the speed of the average car as A, the speed of the 2nd fastest car as B, and the speed of the faster car as C.

Given that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we can express this relationship as:

B = 5A

We are also given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour, so A = 120.

Substituting A = 120 into the equation B = 5A, we get:

B = 5(120)
B = 600

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:

C = 1.25B

Substituting B = 600 into the equation C = 1.25B, we get:

C = 1.25(600)
C = 750

Thus, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine Vince's current age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'x - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We can express this relationship as an equation:

Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 * Vince's age 2 years ago
14 = 2(x - 2)

Now, we can solve for 'x' by distributing the 2 on the right-hand side:

14 = 2x - 4

Next, we add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with 'x':

14 + 4 = 2x - 4 + 4
18 = 2x

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18/2
x = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A, Madeline as M, Camden as C, and Sarah as S.

We are given that A = M, C + S = 30, and C = S + 12. We can use these equations to solve for the individual values of A, C, and S.

First, we can express C in terms of S using the equation C = S + 12. Substituting this into the equation C + S = 30, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we obtain 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which yields 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find S = 9.

Now that we have the value of S, we can determine the value of C by substituting S = 9 into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we can conclude that A = M = 13.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted by subtracting A from C: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we can employ a straightforward approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds by dividing by 16:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Finally, we can find the total weight of the crayons and boxes by adding their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds.

Final answer: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to calculate the total number of planks and then multiply it by the price per plank.

First, we find the total number of logs John can make from the 80-foot tree. Since he cuts the tree into 4-foot logs, we can calculate this as follows:

Total length of tree = 80 feet
Log length = 4 feet
Number of logs = Total length / Log length
= 80 feet / 4 feet
= 20 logs

Next, we calculate the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5 (since each log can be cut into 5 planks):

Number of logs = 20
Planks per log = 5
Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log
= 20 * 5
= 100 planks

Finally, we calculate the total amount John makes by multiplying the total number of planks by the price per plank ($1.2):

Total number of planks = 100
Price per plank = $1.2
Total amount = Total number of planks * Price per plank
= 100 * $1.2
= $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can start by finding their individual salaries.

Since Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary, we can calculate her brother's salary as 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month. Their mother earns twice this amount, so her salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, we can find the total amount of money they all have together by adding their individual salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we can break down her walk into two segments: the beach and the sidewalk. 

Let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as 'b' miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2b miles per minute. 

We know that the time spent walking on the beach is 40 minutes, and the distance covered on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can write:

40 = 2 / b

Solving for b, we get:

b = 2 / 40
b = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 / (2b)
Time = 1 / (2 * (1/20))
Time = 1 / (1/10)
Time = 10 minutes

Since the total distance is 3 miles, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 10 minutes, the time spent on the beach is:

Time on beach = 40 minutes

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 + 10
Total time = 50 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can employ a simple linear equation. Let's denote the number of weeks as 'w' and the weekly savings as 's'. We know that Jane has already saved $32 in 8 weeks, and she wants to save a total of $60.

The total amount saved can be represented as the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
Total Amount = s * w

We can set up an equation using the given information:
32 = 8s
60 = s * w

To find the number of weeks, we can rearrange the first equation to solve for 's':
s = 32 / 8
s = 4

Now, we can substitute the value of 's' into the second equation:
60 = 4 * w
w = 60 / 4
w = 15

Since we want to find the number of additional weeks, we subtract the initial 8 weeks:
Additional Weeks = 15 - 8
Additional Weeks = 7

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 7"
"To determine the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can employ a straightforward additive approach. We have three distinct scenarios to consider:

1. Three trees, each containing 7 blue birds, contribute a total of 3 × 7 = 21 blue birds.
2. Two trees, each having 4 blue birds, add 2 × 4 = 8 blue birds to the total count.
3. A single tree, with 3 blue birds, contributes 3 to the overall total.

By summing these values, we obtain the total number of blue birds: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. According to the problem, if he receives 2 dozen (24) more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. This can be expressed as an equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the initial number of marbles, we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now that we know Bob initially has 36 marbles, we can determine the number of marbles he has after losing 10 marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

Therefore, Bob will have 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. We can set up the following equation:

(4/8) * 33 + (1/8) * x = 40

This equation represents the total amount of water Donny has after pouring from both mugs. We can simplify the equation:

(1/2) * 33 + (1/8) * x = 40

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fractions:

4 * 33 + x = 320

132 + x = 320

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x = 188

However, this solution is inconsistent with the problem statement, as the temperature of the second mug must be at least 40 degrees. Since we cannot have a negative temperature, we need to re-examine our assumptions.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. If Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, it means the remaining water in the 33-degree mug is not enough to make the total temperature 40 degrees. Therefore, the temperature of the second mug must be greater than 40 degrees.

Since the problem statement does not provide any additional information, we can assume that the temperature of the second mug is the minimum required to make the total temperature 40 degrees. Let's set up an inequality:

(4/8) * 33 + (1/8) * x ≥ 40

Simplify the inequality:

(1/2) * 33 + (1/8) * x ≥ 40

Multiply both sides by 8:

4 * 33 + x ≥ 320

132 + x ≥ 320

Subtract 132 from both sides:

x ≥ 188

Since x must be at least 40 degrees, we can set up the following inequality:

40 ≤ x

The minimum possible value of x is 40 degrees.

Final answer: 40"
"To determine the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.

The number of cows added per day is 20, and the number of chickens added per day is 10. Therefore, the total number of cows added is 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows, and the total number of chickens added is 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks by adding the initial number of animals to the total number of cows and chickens added. The initial number of cows is 50, and the initial number of chickens is 20.

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"To determine the cost of each bagel after the discount, we can apply the concept of percentage decrease to the original cost of the bagels. 

First, we calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels: 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.

Next, we calculate the discount amount: 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we divide the total cost after the discount by the number of bagels in 4 packs, which is 9. 

The cost per bagel is $36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a step-by-step approach, leveraging our understanding of algebraic relationships and mathematical operations.

Let's denote the number of scoops Gomer ate as 's' and the number of potatoes required for 's' scoops as 'p'. We are given that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so s = 23 - 5 = 18.

We are also given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be represented as:

p = (6 - 3) = 3 potatoes for 3 - 1 = 2 scoops

To find the number of potatoes required for 1 scoop, we can divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops:

p = 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we can find the number of potatoes required for 18 scoops by multiplying 1.5 potatoes per scoop by 18 scoops:

p = 1.5 * 18 = 27 potatoes

However, we are asked to find the number of potatoes Gomer ate, which is 5 scoops less than 23 scoops. Since we already know Gomer ate 18 scoops, we can directly calculate the number of potatoes he ate:

Number of potatoes = 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the two distinct periods and then convert it to dozens.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs consumed in 60 days is the sum of the eggs consumed in the two periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can employ a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R. We are given that G = 17 and R = 2G. The total number of jellybeans is 60, so we can set up the equation:

B + G + R = 60

Substituting R = 2G and G = 17, we get:

B + 17 + 2(17) = 60

Simplifying the equation:

B + 17 + 34 = 60

Combine like terms:

B + 51 = 60

Subtract 51 from both sides:

B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since Tim grows 5 trees and each tree yields 6 lemons per year, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Number of lemons per year = Number of trees × Number of lemons per tree
= 5 × 6
= 30 lemons per year

To find the total number of lemons collected in a decade, we can multiply the number of lemons per year by the number of years in a decade (10):

Total lemons in a decade = Number of lemons per year × Number of years in a decade
= 30 × 10
= 300 lemons

Therefore, Tim collects 300 lemons in a decade.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84, and we are asked to find the number of women who remained after 20 women alighted from the bus.

First, we can find the total number of parts in the ratio by adding the number of men and women: 5 + 9 = 14.

Next, we can divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts to find the value of one part: 84 ÷ 14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we can multiply 9 by the value of one part to find the initial number of women: 9 × 6 = 54.

Now, we can subtract the number of women who alighted from the bus to find the number of women who remained: 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, the number of women who remained on the bus is 34.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the total number of sunflowers sold, we can start by calculating the number of bouquets sold. Given that Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day and he sold it for 3 days, the total number of bouquets sold can be calculated as:

Total bouquets sold = Total earnings from bouquets / Earnings per bouquet
Total bouquets sold = $56 / $8
Total bouquets sold = 7

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold can be calculated as:

Total sunflowers sold = Total bouquets sold * Number of sunflowers per bouquet
Total sunflowers sold = 7 * 12
Total sunflowers sold = 84

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 84 sunflowers after 3 days.

Final answer: 84"
"To determine the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost and the total revenue.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. However, this doesn't make sense, as the revenue is less than the cost. This implies that Adam can't sell all his rocks at $7 each.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost. However, this equation doesn't make sense.

To find the amount of money Adam loses, we need to find the difference between the total cost and the total revenue. Since the total revenue is less than the total cost, Adam loses money.

Let's calculate the amount of money Adam loses:

Loss = Total Cost - Total Revenue
= $7x - $4.2x
= $2.8x

Since Adam invested $100, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x:

$2.8x = $100

x = $100 / $2.8
x = 35.71

Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the amount of money Adam loses:

Loss = $2.8x
= $2.8 * 35.71
= $100 - $100 * 0.6
= $100 - $60
= $40

Therefore, Adam loses $40.

The correct answer is: $40"
"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we can calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then find the maximum value.

Let's calculate the time required for each type of picture scene:

- Time for large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Time for medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Time for small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum value. In this case, the maximum value is 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we can utilize the concept of division. Since Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, we can express this as a mathematical expression: 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

Now, we need to divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4) to find the number of eggs each child receives. This can be represented as:

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Therefore, each child will receive 9 eggs.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and there are 31 days in May, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

Total cost = Number of days in May * Daily cost per fish
Total cost = 31 * $1
Total cost = $31

Therefore, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can employ a simple arithmetic operation. We start with the initial number of roses, subtract the number she gave to her mother, and then add the number she purchased.

Let's denote the initial number of roses as I, the number given to her mother as G, and the number purchased as P. We are given I = 30, G = 24, and P = 15.

The total number of roses now (T) can be calculated using the formula:

T = I - G + P

Substituting the given values, we get:

T = 30 - 24 + 15

"To determine Sid's average speed, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. In this scenario, the total distance traveled is the sum of the initial 110 miles and the additional 140 miles, while the total time taken is the sum of the initial 2 hours and the additional 3 hours.

Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, Sid's average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"In probability theory, we can model the independent events of buying two lottery tickets as a product of their individual probabilities. Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form, and the second ticket is three times more likely to win, its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey as C, J, and Y, respectively.

We are given that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. This can be represented by the equation:

J = C + 5

We are also given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This can be represented by the equation:

C = 2Y

Since the total number of seashells is the sum of the seashells collected by each person, we can set up the equation:

C + J + Y = 81

Substituting the first equation into the third equation, we get:

(2Y) + (2Y + 5) + Y = 81

Combine like terms:

5Y + 5 = 81

Subtract 5 from both sides:

5Y = 76

Divide both sides by 5:

Y = 15.2

Now that we know Carrey collected 15.2 seashells, we can find the number of seashells collected by Carlos:

C = 2Y
C = 2(15.2)
C = 30.4

Now that we know the number of seashells collected by each person, we can find the number of seashells each person got when they divided them equally:

Total seashells = C + J + Y
Total seashells = 30.4 + 27 + 15.2
Total seashells = 72.6

Number of seashells per person = Total seashells / 3
Number of seashells per person = 72.6 / 3
Number of seashells per person = 24.2

Since we cannot divide seashells into fractions, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the exact value.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24.2}$"
"To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we can employ a straightforward arithmetic approach. 

First, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays, and he eats 4 carrots each day, the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Next, we calculate the total number of carrots Mason consumes on the weekend. There are 2 weekend days, and he eats 5 carrots each day, resulting in:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots consumed on weekdays and the weekend to obtain the overall weekly consumption:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we can calculate the length of the second song by finding 60% of the length of the first song and adding it to the length of the first song.

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The length of the second song is then x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs:
Total time = x + 1.6x
Total time = 2.6x

Since we know the length of the first song is 5 minutes, we can substitute x = 5 into the equation:
Total time = 2.6 * 5
Total time = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"To calculate the total profit, we can employ the concept of linear algebra and basic arithmetic operations. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost of the devices purchased. Since Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, the total cost can be calculated as:

Total Cost = (2 * $20) + (4 * $20)
Total Cost = $40 + $80
Total Cost = $120

Next, we need to calculate the total selling price of the devices. Since Linus sells each device for twice the original price, the selling price of each device is $40. Therefore, the total selling price can be calculated as:

Total Selling Price = (2 * $20) + (4 * $20)
Total Selling Price = 2 * $40 + 4 * $40
Total Selling Price = $80 + $160
Total Selling Price = $240

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price:

Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information using a step-by-step approach.

Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can establish the height of her brother, Ned, by subtracting 2 feet from Isabel's height. This yields Ned's height as 7 - 2 = 5 feet.

Next, we can calculate Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height, resulting in Carl's height of 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can calculate the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. This gives us 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand, we can calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people and then divide it by the energy demand per bottle.

Energy demand per bottle = 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand
Energy demand per bottle = 0.2

Total energy demand of 2300 people = 2300 * 0.2
Total energy demand of 2300 people = 460

Since each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 460 people's energy demand.

Number of bottles needed = Total energy demand of 2300 people / Energy demand per bottle
Number of bottles needed = 460 / 0.2
Number of bottles needed = 2300

However, Hortex can only produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we can subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the total number of bottles needed.

"To determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can employ a straightforward approach based on the given information.

Let's denote the total number of babies as 8. We know that 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple, which translates to 6 babies wearing purple. Additionally, 1/3 of the purple wearers and 1/3 of the blue wearers also wear bows.

The number of purple wearers who also wear bows can be calculated as 1/3 * 6 = 2. The number of blue wearers is 2, and 1/3 of them wear bows, which equals 1/3 * 2 = 2/3. However, since we are interested in the total number of bow wearers, we need to add the number of purple bow wearers and blue bow wearers: 2 + 2/3 = 8/3.

Now, we can calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:

Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 2 / (8/3)
= 2 * 3 / 8
= 6 / 8
= 3 / 4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%.

The final answer is 75%."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the total number of reports received as T, the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday as M, the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday as F, and the number of reports received on Wednesday as W.

We are given the following information:

T = 5168
M = 1907
F = 2136

We can express the total number of reports received as the sum of the reports received on each day, minus the overlap between the reports received on Monday and Thursday, and the reports received on Tuesday and Friday.

Since we are not provided with the overlap between Monday and Thursday, or Tuesday and Friday, we will assume that the overlap between these days is zero. This is a reasonable assumption, as the problem does not provide any information about the overlap.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can write the equation:

T = M + F + W

Substituting the given values, we get:

5168 = 1907 + 2136 + W

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5168 = 4043 + W

Subtracting 4043 from both sides, we get:

1125 = W

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to calculate the total area of land sold and then multiply it by the selling price per square meter.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is equivalent to 40 square meters. Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, which is 20 square meters.

The total area of land sold is 40 + 20 = 60 square meters. The remaining area is 80 - 60 = 20 square meters.

Abraham sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, resulting in a total revenue of 20 * 3 = $60.

The total revenue from selling all the land is the sum of the revenue from the first two sales and the revenue from the last sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

The final answer is: $140"
"To determine Geb's age, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote Haley's age as H and Geb's age as G. According to the problem, G = (1/2)H - 10.

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that he changes his face mask 2 times a day and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate his daily face mask usage as follows:

Daily face mask usage = Number of face mask changes per day * Number of times he goes out per day
= 2 face masks/day * 3 times/day
= 6 face masks/day

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we can multiply the daily usage by 2:

Total face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks/day * 2 days
= 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of eggs found and subtracting that from the initial number of eggs.

Let's denote the number of eggs found by each person as follows:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 × 5 = 10 eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we can calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"

Let x be the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. Then, the last complex has 1.6x apartments (100% + 60% increase). We know that x = 400 (from the given information), so the last complex has 1.6 * 400 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

Finally, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying the total number of collections by the payment per collection: 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

The problem states that a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We can represent the number of fruits produced by each tree as follows:

Year 1: 50
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100
Year 9: 0
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:

Total = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000
Total = 52500

Therefore, the total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."
"To determine the amount of money Jack has now, we can apply the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we can calculate the amount she gave him as a fraction of her total wealth.

Let's denote Jack's initial amount as J and Sophia's initial amount as S. We know that J = $100 and S = $100. The amount Sophia gave to Jack is 1/5 of her total wealth, which can be expressed as (1/5)S.

To find the amount Jack has now, we add the amount Sophia gave him to his initial amount:

J + (1/5)S = $100 + (1/5)($100)

Using the distributive property, we can simplify the expression:

$100 + (1/5)($100) = $100 + $20

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a system of linear equations to represent the relationships between the lengths of the three ropes. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R.

We are given that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, which can be expressed as:

B = Y - 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write:

R = 4B

Furthermore, the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, which gives us the equation:

Y + B + R = 37

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:

Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation, we have:

6Y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides yields:

6Y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6 results in:

Y = 12

Now that we have found the length of the yellow rope, we can determine the length of the blue rope:

B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can calculate the length of the red rope:

R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by defining the variables. Let's denote the amount of money Ronnie was given as 'x'. Since Rissa was given thrice as much, the amount of money Rissa was given is 3x.

We know that after giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This can be represented as:

3x - x = (4/5) * 3x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = (12/5)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = (12/5)x * (5/2)
x = 6

Now that we know the amount of money Ronnie was given, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left. Ronnie's initial money is $5, and she gave her sister $6. However, since the problem states that Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, we need to re-evaluate the situation.

Let's re-examine the problem. If Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, then Ronnie also gave an equal amount of money to her sister. This means that the amount of money Ronnie gave to her sister is also $6. Since Ronnie was given $5, she has $5 - $6 = -$1 left.

However, this is not possible since the amount of money cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

The correct interpretation is that Rissa gave an equal amount of money to her sister, and Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister. This means that the amount of money Ronnie gave to her sister is $3 (since Rissa gave 3 times as much as Ronnie). Since Ronnie was given $5, she has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of each color paint as 'x'. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow, we can express the total amount of paint used as:

x + x + x + x + x = 12

This equation simplifies to 4x = 12.

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 12/4

x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of each room and sum them together. 

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom: 20 feet (length) * 12 feet (width) = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 240 (bedroom) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"To determine the total number of clouds Alice counted across the five days, we can utilize the concept of a geometric sequence. The number of clouds on each day is doubling from the previous day, which indicates a common ratio of 2. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the series
- a is the first term (3 clouds on Monday)
- r is the common ratio (2)
- n is the number of terms (5 days)

Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 3 * (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 * (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 * (-31) / (-1)
S = 3 * 31
S = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93."
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The original box has 100 pods and costs $12, so the cost per pod is $12 / 100 = $0.12. 

The new box has 20% more pods, which means it has 120 pods. To find the cost per pod, we can divide the cost of the new box ($12) by the number of pods (120): 

$12 ÷ 120 = $0.10 per pod.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod ($0.10) to find the number of cycles: 

$1 ÷ $0.10 = 10 cycles.

Therefore, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20-dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40 bills. After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he is left with 20 bills. Finally, he triples his money, resulting in 60 bills. 

To convert these bills to 5-dollar bills, we can multiply the total number of bills by 5. Therefore, the total number of 5-dollar bills Thomas has is 60 * 5 = 300.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first half and the second half.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals, while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A. This can be expressed as:

Goals scored by team A in the first half = 4
Goals scored by team B in the first half = 4 - 2 = 2

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Total goals scored by team A = 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5
Total goals scored by team B = 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams:
Total goals = 4.5 + 10 = 14.5

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 14.5."
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can model the situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as t.

Initially, the teacher has 5 inches of chalk, so L = 5. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, which can be represented as 0.20L. On Monday, he used 45% of the chalk, which is 0.45L. Since he recycled the chalk when it reached 2.25 inches, we can set up the equation:

0.20L = 0.45L - 2.25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.20L = 0.45L - 2.25
0.25L = 2.25
L = 9

This means the teacher actually had 9 inches of chalk initially. Now, we can find the number of days it will take to use up the remaining chalk at a rate of 20% per day.

Let's denote the remaining chalk as R. We know that R = 2.25 inches. The equation for the remaining chalk is:

R = 0.20L - 0.20t

Substituting L = 9 and R = 2.25, we get:

2.25 = 0.20(9) - 0.20t
2.25 = 1.8 - 0.20t
0.45 = -0.20t
t = -0.45 / 0.20
t = 2.25

Since the teacher cannot write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the teacher will use up the remaining chalk in 3 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of students and subtracting the number of students on varsity.

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of girls as G, and the number of boys as B. We are given that G = 12 and B = 12.

The number of girls on varsity is 1/3 of G, which can be expressed as G/3. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is 1/4 of B, which can be expressed as B/4.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is G/3 + B/4.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case. Therefore, we can rewrite the fractions as (4G + 3B)/12.

Substituting the given values, we get (4*12 + 3*12)/12 = (48 + 36)/12 = 84/12 = 7.

Now, we can calculate the number of students not on varsity by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students: T - (G/3 + B/4) = 24 - 7 = 17.

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of face masks Mike bought as 'm'. According to the problem, Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, which can be expressed as 3m + 2.

We are given that Mike bought 5 face masks, so we can substitute m = 5 into the equation: 3(5) + 2.

First, we calculate 3 times 5, which equals 15. Then, we add 2 to get 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

17"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixed, we need to calculate the total number of teeth fixed and divide it by the total number of teeth, then multiply by 100.

The dentist drilled 4 teeth and capped 11 teeth (since 7 more than the number drilled). 

Total number of teeth fixed = Number of teeth drilled + Number of teeth capped
= 4 + 11
= 15

Total number of teeth = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100
= 50%

Therefore, the dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to determine the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus returned. Since he returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk, we can calculate the refund amount as follows:

Refund Amount = (2/5) * 4000 * $3.5

First, we can simplify the fraction 2/5 by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2:

Refund Amount = (1/2.5) * 4000 * $3.5

To simplify the fraction 1/2.5, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 2:

Refund Amount = (1/5) * 8000 * $3.5

Now, we can multiply the numbers:

Refund Amount = (1/5) * 28000

To calculate the final amount, we can multiply the numerator and denominator:

Refund Amount = 5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to represent Wendy's and Colin's ages. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be expressed as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

Now, let's consider the second statement, which states that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

Therefore, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to first calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000.

The cost of one set of 100 books is $500. We can find the total number of sets by dividing the total amount Bob has by the cost of one set:

Total amount = $27,000
Cost per set = $500

Number of sets = Total amount ÷ Cost per set
= $27,000 ÷ $500
= 54 sets

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we can divide the total number of sets by 3 to find the number of sets per school:

Number of sets per school = Total sets ÷ Number of schools
= 54 sets ÷ 3
= 18 sets

As each set contains 100 books, we can multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school:

Number of books per school = Number of sets per school × 100
= 18 sets × 100
= 1800 books

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school."
"To solve this problem, we can model the situation using a recursive sequence. Let's define a function A(n) as the number of apples Newton has after the nth step.

Initially, Newton has 2 apples, so A(1) = 2.

In the first step, Newton picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as:

A(1) = 2 + 5 - 1 = 6

In the second step, Newton picks up the 6 apples, puts all but 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as:

A(2) = 6 + 6 - 1 = 11

In the third step, Newton picks up the 11 apples, puts all but 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This can be represented as:

A(3) = 11 + 6 - 1 = 16

We can see that the sequence A(n) is formed by adding 5, 6, 6, ... to the previous term, which is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. However, the initial term is 2, not 0. To account for this, we can define the sequence as:

A(n) = 2 + 5(1 + 2 + ... + (n-1))

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we can simplify this to:

A(n) = 2 + 5((n-1)n/2)

Now, we can calculate the number of apples Newton brings home, which is A(3):

A(3) = 2 + 5((3-1)3/2)
= 2 + 5(2*3/2)
= 2 + 15
= 17

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can employ a straightforward approach by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg) to determine the number of bags, then multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag ($18).

Number of bags = Total weight of coal / Weight per bag
= 850 kg / 50 kg
= 17 bags

Total cost = Number of bags * Cost per bag
= 17 bags * $18 per bag
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can calculate the total number of slices required and then divide it by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend consumes 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, resulting in a total of 10 slices per friend. With 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

Since the cheese pizza has 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, the total number of slices per pizza is 12 + 8 = 20. To find the number of pizzas needed, we can divide the total number of slices consumed (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to purchase 3 pizzas to satisfy her friends' pizza consumption.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can utilize the principle of addition. We have two sets of miles: 3 miles for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and 5 miles for Tuesday and Thursday.

Let's calculate the total miles for each set: 
3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles
5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we can add the miles from both sets: 
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs, we can model this situation using a linear equation. Let's denote the number of snowballs Jay builds per hour as 'b' and the time it takes to build 60 snowballs as 't' hours.

We know that Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, so b = 20. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which is equivalent to 1/4 of an hour. Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is b - 2/4 = 20 - 0.5 = 19.5.

Now, we can set up the equation: 19.5t = 60, where t is the time in hours.

Solving for t, we get:

t = 60 / 19.5
t = 3.0769 hours

Rounding to the nearest whole number, it will take Jay approximately 3 hours and 5 minutes to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.08}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote John's age as J and Jim's age as x. According to the problem, John is twice as old as Jim, so we can express this relationship as:

J = 2x

We are given that John's current age is 28, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, Jim's age is 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can employ a simple arithmetic approach. Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate one more slice than Doxa, the number of slices her sister ate is x + 1. Similarly, her brother ate one more slice than her sister, so the number of slices her brother ate is (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten can be represented as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Combining like terms, we get:

3x + 3

We are given that the total number of slices is 8. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

3x = 5

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Doxa ate 1 slice, her sister ate 2 slices, and her brother ate 3 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages, so they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 78

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

x = 63

Therefore, the nurses started with 63 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{63}$"
"To determine the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut and add it to the cost of the color. 

The cost of the haircut is calculated by finding the difference in length of her hair, which is 10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches. Since the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is given as $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost of May's haircut and color is $100."
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the number of hours worked per week by the number of weeks in April, and then multiplying the result by her hourly rate. Additionally, we must account for her daily attendance bonus.

First, we calculate the total hours worked in April: 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7.5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours.

Next, we calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate: 180 hours * $1.5/hour = $270.

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10 per day, which amounts to $10 * 6 days = $60.

Therefore, her total earnings for April can be calculated as: $270 (hourly earnings) + $60 (attendance bonus) = $330.

The final answer is: $330"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we can apply the principle of simple arithmetic. 

First, we need to calculate the earnings from each task: 

- Earning from emptying the dishwasher: 6 times * $0.50 = $3.00
- Earning from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Earning from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
- Earning from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings = $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To calculate the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we can utilize the concept of scalar multiplication. Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can express this relationship as a ratio: 3:1 (shark:whale). 

We can then multiply the amount of blood a whale has by the ratio to find the amount of blood a shark has: 40 * 3 = 120 gallons. 

Now, we can multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10 to find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have: 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct periods: morning, 10:00, and evening.

Let's denote the number of people who entered the restaurant in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered by evening as E. We are given the following information:

M = 50 (number of people who entered in the morning)
T = 40 (number of people who entered at 10:00)
E = 3T (number of people who entered by evening, which is three times the number of people who entered at 10:00)

We can express the total number of people who entered the restaurant as the sum of the people who entered in each period: M + T + E.

Substituting the given values, we get:
M + T + E = 50 + 40 + 3(40)
= 50 + 40 + 120
= 210

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 210.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we can employ basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we calculate the number of red pens: 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

Next, we calculate the number of black pens, which is twice the amount of red pens: 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

Finally, we sum the number of red and black pens to obtain the total: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the total cost of the scotch and cognac, we can break down the problem into two parts. 

First, we calculate the cost of the scotch. Given that John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, we can find the cost per bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = Total cost ÷ Number of bottles
= $600 ÷ 10
= $60 per bottle

Next, we calculate the cost of the cognac. Since the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, we can find the cost per bottle by multiplying the cost of the scotch by 1.5:

Cost per bottle of cognac = Cost per bottle of scotch × 1.5
= $60 × 1.5
= $90 per bottle

Now, we can find the total cost of the cognac by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles:

Total cost of cognac = Number of bottles × Cost per bottle of cognac
= 20 × $90
= $1800

Finally, we can find the total cost of everything by adding the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac:

Total cost = Cost of scotch + Total cost of cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To determine the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we can break down the problem into two parts: the number of White Oak trees and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees.

Let's denote the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day as W1 and the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day as P1. We are given that W1 = 20. Since Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees on the first day, we can express P1 as 2W1, which equals 2 * 20 = 40.

On the second day, the number of White Oak trees planted is W2 = W1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. The number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is P2 = P1 + (1/4)P1 = 40 + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is W1 + P1 = 20 + 40 = 60. The total number of trees planted on the second day is W2 + P2 = 30 + 50 = 80.

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we can analyze the sequence of events that led to the reduction in the initial 24 gallons.

Initially, 4 gallons were consumed on the first day, resulting in 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, resulting in 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remaining.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, leaving 8 - 3 = 5 gallons.

Since the remaining 5 gallons were shared equally among 3 people, we can calculate the amount each person received by dividing the remaining gallons by the number of people:

5 gallons ÷ 3 people = 5/3 gallons per person.

To express this as a decimal, we can divide 5 by 3:

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To solve the given problem, we can employ algebraic techniques to isolate the variable representing the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as x.

The equation can be set up as follows: 4x + 8 = 40

Subtracting 8 from both sides yields 4x = 32

Dividing both sides by 4 results in x = 8

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

Final Answer: The final answer is 8."
"To determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into two steps. 

First, we need to find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we can calculate this as follows:

Number of fish with red stripes = (1/3) * Total number of fish
= (1/3) * 66
= 22

Next, we need to find the number of fish with blue stripes. We are given that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. To find the remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

Remaining fish = Total number of fish - Number of fish with red stripes
= 66 - 22
= 44

Now, we can find the number of fish with blue stripes:

Number of fish with blue stripes = (5/11) * Remaining fish
= (5/11) * 44
= 20

Finally, to find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:

Total number of fish with red and blue stripes = Number of fish with red stripes + Number of fish with blue stripes
= 22 + 20
= 42

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to consider the colors from both the palettes and the makeup sets.

Initially, Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, resulting in a total of 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes. Additionally, she had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, contributing a total of 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets. Therefore, the total number of colors Amy had initially was 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

However, her sister stole one palette, which contained 4 colors. This reduced the total number of colors to 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then used up half of the colors from one makeup set, which had 6 colors. Since half of 6 is 3, she used up 3 colors. This leaves her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we can break down the problem into manageable components. 

First, we need to establish the height of the first floor, which is given as 7 times Mattison's height. Since Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we need to find the height of the second floor, which is stated to be thrice Mattison's height. Therefore, the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of 700.

Let's denote the total number of shells as T = 700. The number of shells found by team Alphas can be calculated as:

Number of shells found by Alphas = 0.4T = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Next, we find the remaining shells after team Alphas' contribution.

Remaining shells = T - Number of shells found by Alphas = 700 - 280 = 420

Now, we calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

Number of shells found by The finders = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Finally, we determine the number of shells found by team Gogetters by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Number of shells found by Gogetters = Remaining shells - Number of shells found by The finders = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the walking distance required for the last dog, we can utilize the concept of averages. Given that the average walking distance for all four dogs is 3 miles per day, we can calculate the total walking distance required for all dogs and then subtract the known distances for the first three dogs.

Let's denote the unknown walking distance for the last dog as x. The total walking distance for all four dogs can be expressed as:

Total walking distance = 3 miles (average) * 4 dogs
Total walking distance = 12 miles

We know the walking distances for the first three dogs: 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. We can subtract these from the total walking distance to find the walking distance for the last dog:

x = Total walking distance - (1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles)
x = 12 miles - 8 miles
x = 4 miles

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to determine the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be calculated as:

Loan Amount = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan is used to pay off debts. Since 60% of the loan is used for debt repayment, we can calculate this as:

Amount Used for Debt Repayment = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

Finally, to find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used for debt repayment from the loan amount:

Amount Leftover = Loan Amount - Amount Used for Debt Repayment
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."
"To determine Deandre's total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to calculate the total weight of the tunas caught and then multiply it by the cost per kilogram.

The total weight of the tunas caught is the sum of the weights of the individual tunas: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate Deandre's total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the cost per kilogram:

Total Earnings = Total Weight * Cost per Kilogram
Total Earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg
Total Earnings = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we can apply the formula for calculating profit, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

Given that Trinity sells magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them, we can express this as a mathematical expression:

Selling Price = (11/8) * Cost Price

We are given that the cost price is $72. Substituting this value into the expression, we get:

Selling Price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Now, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
= 99 - 72
= 27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we can calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and sum them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in a total of 2 * 3 = 6 liters. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 5 days, resulting in a total of 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

The total amount of water removed is the sum of the amounts removed at each setting: 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can employ a simple subtraction approach. Given that there are 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is calculated as follows:

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Since 12 balloons are left, the number of balloons thrown can be found by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total:

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is 288."
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

Let's denote the amount of the first medicine as x. According to the problem, the amount of the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, so it can be represented as 3x.

The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the amounts of the two medicines, which is x + 3x = 4x.

Since Saanvi needs to combine 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine, we can set up the equation 4x = 14 + 3(14) to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 14 + 42, which further simplifies to 4x = 56.

Dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = 14.

Now that we know the amount of the first medicine in one dose, we can calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses by multiplying 4x by 8:

4x * 8 = 4(14) * 8
= 56 * 8
= 448

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is: $\boxed{448}$"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30
= 150

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we can break down the problem into two parts: the monthly payments and the remaining interest.

First, let's calculate the total interest accrued over the 11 months. The interest rate is 2% of the initial amount borrowed, which is $300.

Interest = 0.02 * $300 = $6

Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount paid in these months is:

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we need to calculate the remaining amount, including the interest, that will be paid in the twelfth month. This can be found by subtracting the total amount paid in 11 months from the initial amount borrowed, plus the interest.

Remaining amount = Initial amount + Interest - Total amount paid in 11 months
= $300 + $6 - $275
= $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.

The final answer is: $31"
"To determine the number of diapers Jordan changes per day, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. Given that there are 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes, the total number of diaper changes can be calculated as follows:

Total diaper changes = Number of children * Diaper changes per child
Total diaper changes = 2 * 5
Total diaper changes = 10

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we can calculate the number of diapers Jordan changes by dividing the total number of diaper changes by 2:

Number of diapers Jordan changes = Total diaper changes / 2
Number of diapers Jordan changes = 10 / 2
Number of diapers Jordan changes = 5

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day."
"To determine the number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the total volume of the jar. Given that the jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, we can calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

V = 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches

However, the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, so we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to account for the empty space between the jelly beans.

Total number of jelly beans = 540 / 0.8 = 675

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans by multiplying the total number of jelly beans by 0.3.

Number of red jelly beans = 675 * 0.3 = 202.5

However, we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number.

Difference = 900 - 202.5 = 697.5

The final answer is: $\boxed{697.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is (3/4) * 40 = 30. Therefore, 30 people entered the bus at the second station, increasing the total to 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled, resulting in a total of 90 * 2 = 180 people.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we can break down the problem into two parts: the initial 5 years and the next 3 years.

The initial cost of one visit was $2, and it increased by 150% after 5 years. To find the new cost, we can calculate 150% of $2 as $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5. The new cost of one visit is $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so her annual expenditure was 3 * $2 = $6. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $6 = $30.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so her annual expenditure was 3 * $5 = $15. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the total time required for all students to try the escape room, we can employ a simple division-based approach. Given that 8 students can participate in the escape room at a time, and there are 30 students in total (10 students per grade * 3 grades), we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students per group
= 30 students / 8 students per group
= 3.75 groups

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students. To find the total time required, we can multiply the number of full groups by the time required per group (45 minutes) and add the time required for the partial group:

Time for 3 full groups = 3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes
Time for the partial group = 2 students * 45 minutes/student = 90 minutes (since the partial group will take the full 45 minutes to escape)

Total time required = Time for 3 full groups + Time for the partial group
= 135 minutes + 90 minutes
= 225 minutes

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the total amount Ali has to pay John, we can calculate the cost of the items separately and then sum them.

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each can be calculated using the formula for the cost of multiple items: Cost = Quantity x Price per item. Therefore, the total cost of the tables is 4 x $20 = $80.

Similarly, the cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each can be calculated using the same formula: 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is the sum of the cost of the tables and the cost of the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can utilize the concept of linear equations. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length can be expressed as 4x.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we obtain:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Now that we have determined the length of the shorter piece, we can calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning Aiden needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of ground beef, and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can first calculate the total amount of meat required.

Let's denote the number of pounds of meat as 'x'. We know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs per pound, so the total number of meatballs can be represented as 16x. Since he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can set up the equation:

16x = 80

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides by 16:

x = 80 / 16
x = 5

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, the total amount of seasoning needed is:

2 tablespoons/pound * 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we can calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

The total width of the windows can be found by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window:

Total width = Number of windows × Width of each window
Total width = 5 × 35
Total width = 175 inches

Since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we can calculate the total fabric needed as follows:

Total fabric needed = 2 × Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 × 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we can employ a piecewise approach, considering the two distinct pricing tiers: $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes and $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes.

Let's calculate the cost for each segment:

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes × $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes × $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00."
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. Let's denote the amount of rain on Monday as M and the amount of rain on Tuesday as T. According to the problem, M = 2 inches.

The problem states that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday. This can be expressed as T = 2M + 1.

Substituting the value of M into the equation, we get T = 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that the total number of treats is 10, and each person receives 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats can be expressed as 2 times the number of people, which is 5. This gives us the equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

To solve for x, we can combine like terms and isolate the variable:

4x - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation yields:

4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total cost of Karen's salon visit, we need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, and then add the cost of the nail art.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we can break down the problem into individual components and calculate the total number of issues from each magazine.

First, we know that 3 magazines send 12 issues each, resulting in a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year. 

Next, we are given that 1 magazine sends 6 issues per year. 

We are also informed that the last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, which can be calculated as 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, we can add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can express Shelley's paintings as x + 8. 

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so we can represent Samantha's paintings as (x + 8) - 12. We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, which allows us to set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To calculate the price of the toy after the discounts, we can apply the concept of percentage changes. 

First, we calculate the price increase in December: $40 + 80% of $40 = $40 + $32 = $72.

Next, we calculate the price decrease in January: 50% of $72 = 0.5 * $72 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $72 - $36 = $36.

The final price of the toy after the discounts is $36."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we can break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the earnings from the lessons with veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the 4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. This can be represented as:

4 * $80 = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, which can be expressed as:

$80 - (25% of $80)
= $80 - 0.25 * $80
= $80 - $20
= $60

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the 2 one-hour lessons with veterans at the reduced rate:

2 * $60 = $120

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

$320 + $120 = $440

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To calculate the mean score, we can utilize the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. In this case, the sum of the scores is 630, and there are 9 scores.

Mean = (Sum of scores) / (Number of scores)
Mean = 630 / 9
Mean = 70

Therefore, the mean score is 70."
"To determine the number of pomelos Eve gave away, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of pomelos Eve gave away as x. Since she had 1/4 of the original amount left, we can express this as:

20 - x = (1/4) * 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 - x = 5

To solve for x, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

-x = -15

Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x, we get:

x = 15

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of apples Walter ate, which is 2/5 of the total number of apples he purchased. This can be calculated as:

(2/5) × 60 = (2 × 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24 apples

Next, we need to find the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 apples. This can be calculated as:

60 - 24 = 36 apples

Then, we need to find 25% of the remaining apples, which Walter gave to his sister. This can be calculated as:

(25/100) × 36 = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples

Now, we can find the number of apples remaining after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister:

36 - 9 = 27 apples

Finally, we can calculate the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples at $3 each:

27 × 3 = $81

The final answer is: $81"
"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a proportion based on the given information. If 9 novels represent three-quarters of the novels written this year, we can express this as:

9 = (3/4) × x

where x is the total number of novels written this year. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3:

x = 9 × (4/3)

x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the percentage of the distance covered by Michael, we can utilize the formula for average speed, which is total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Given that Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr and he traveled for 3 days, we can calculate the total distance covered as follows:

Total distance = Average speed × Total time
Total distance = 50 km/hr × 72 hours
Total distance = 3600 km

Now, to find the percentage of the total distance covered, we can divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100:

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) × 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) × 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 × 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we can employ a step-by-step approach. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can express this as:

Number of grapes used by Madeline's brother = 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Next, we add the grapes used by Madeline to find the total grapes used by the family:

Total grapes used by the family = 6 (by Madeline) + 30 (by Madeline's brother) = 36 grapes.

Now, we know that their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. We can express this as:

Total grapes used by the mother = 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the mother, we can set up the equation:

Total grapes used by the family = 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother)

To find the initial number of grapes, we can solve for the total grapes:

Total grapes = 36 + 48
Total grapes = 84

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

Final answer: 84"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we can utilize the principle of addition. The number of teachers who were sick can be represented as 13, and the number of substitute teachers can be represented as 9. By adding these two quantities, we can calculate the total number of teachers present.

Total number of teachers = Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers = 22

Therefore, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day was 22."
"To determine the total annual cost of making macaroni and cheese, we can calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00, and the cost of cheddar cheese per week is $3.00. Since the cost of gruyère cheese is twice that of cheddar cheese, the weekly cost of gruyère cheese is $6.00. Therefore, the total weekly cost is:

$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyère cheese) = $10.00 per week

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total annual cost is:

$10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year

The final answer is: $520."
"To determine the percentage of the custodian's day spent cleaning classrooms, we can calculate the ratio of cleaning time to the total time worked and then convert it to a percentage.

First, we need to find the total time spent cleaning, which is the product of the number of classrooms and the time spent per classroom: 
80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours: 
1200 minutes / 60 = 20 hours

Next, we need to find the total number of hours the custodian works in 5 days: 
5 days * 8 hours/day = 40 hours

Now, we can calculate the ratio of cleaning time to total time worked: 
(20 hours / 40 hours) = 0.5

To convert this ratio to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 
0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we can analyze the capacity of each shelf and the total number of books she has.

Let's denote the number of books the middle shelf can hold as 'm'. Since the bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf, the number of books the bottom shelf can hold is 2m. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 2m - 5 books.

We are given that the total number of books Elly has is 110. We can set up an equation to represent the total capacity of the shelves:

m + 2m + (2m - 5) = 110

Combine like terms:

5m - 5 = 110

Add 5 to both sides:

5m = 115

Divide both sides by 5:

m = 23

Now that we know the middle shelf can hold 23 books, we can find the number of books the bottom shelf can hold (2m = 2 * 23 = 46) and the top shelf can hold (2m - 5 = 23 - 5 = 18).

To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves. The total capacity is 23 + 46 + 18 = 87 books. 

Since 110 books exceed the total capacity of 87 books, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine Rose's profit, we can employ the concept of cost and revenue. The cost of purchasing the eggs is $2.40 per dozen, and Rose buys five dozens, resulting in a total cost of 5 × $2.40 = $12.

The selling price of each egg is $1, and there are 60 eggs in total. Therefore, the total revenue can be calculated as 60 × $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $60 - $12 = $48.

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps. 

First, we find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This can be expressed as (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky, we can apply the concept of unit price. The discounted price of the bag is $15.00, and it contains 30 sticks. 

The unit price can be calculated as the total price divided by the number of units (sticks):
Unit Price = Total Price ÷ Number of Units
Unit Price = $15.00 ÷ 30
Unit Price = $0.50

To express the unit price in cents, we can multiply by 100:
Unit Price = $0.50 × 100
Unit Price = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of beef jerky costs 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly. Since she must achieve a 70% passing score, we can set up the following equation:

Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110

Let x be the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test. Then, the total number of questions she needs to get correct is:

0.7(110) = 77

Since she already got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6(70) = 42 questions, we can set up the following equation:

42 + x = 77

Solving for x, we get:

x = 77 - 42
x = 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to achieve a 70% passing score and move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a linear equation approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can express this relationship as:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4

We are given that the total number of ice cubes is 116. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation yields:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:

x = 20

Now that we have determined the value of x, we can calculate the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can utilize the formula for calculating total points:

Total Points = Number of Games Played * Points per Game

Given:
Number of Games Played per Year = 40
Number of Years = 4
Points per Game = 21

Total Points = 40 * 4 * 21

First, we multiply the number of games played per year by the number of years:
40 * 4 = 160

Then, we multiply the result by the points per game:
160 * 21 = 3360

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"To determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with, we can analyze the sequence of events. Initially, he had 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 5 marbles, resulting in 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, bringing the total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. However, upon closer inspection, he discovered that one of the marbles was not a marble but a bead, so he discarded it. This means he was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can employ a linear model based on the given historical averages. 

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of telephone calls made.
- Let y be the number of potential customers generated.
- Let z be the number of customers who visit the dealership.
- Let w be the number of cars sold.

We are given the following relationships:
- For every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated: y = x/25
- For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold: w = z/2
- We want to find the number of calls needed to sell 15 cars, so w = 15

We can start by finding the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:
z = 2w
z = 2(15)
z = 30

Now, we can find the number of potential customers needed:
y = z
y = 30

Finally, we can find the number of telephone calls needed:
x = 25y
x = 25(30)
x = 750

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family, we can break down the problem into two components: the number of candles and the number of flashlights.

First, let's calculate the total number of candles. Since there are 8 rooms in the house, half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. We can express this as:

Total candles = (4 small candles/room) * (4 rooms) + (5 medium candles/room) * (4 rooms)
Total candles = 16 + 20
Total candles = 36

Next, we know that there are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:

Total flashlights = 4 people

Now, we can find the total number of candles and flashlights by adding the two quantities together:

Total = Total candles + Total flashlights
Total = 36 + 4
Total = 40

"To determine the number of chips each person receives, we can employ a simple division operation. Given that Mitchell has 110 chips in total and there are 5 family members, we can calculate the number of chips per person as follows:

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips ÷ Number of family members
= 110 chips ÷ 5
= 22 chips

Therefore, each family member will receive 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube, we can break down the process into individual segments and calculate the time for each segment.

The first side of the cube takes 5 minutes to solve. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, resulting in 10 minutes for each. The last two sides, which are the fourth and fifth sides, take half as long as the first side, resulting in 2.5 minutes for each.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the time for each segment:

Time = 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5

Using the commutative and associative properties of addition, we can simplify the expression:

Time = (5 + 10 + 2.5) + 2.5
Time = (17.5) + 2.5
Time = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time required to solve the Rubik's cube is 20 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of items in the changing room, we can utilize a straightforward algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of robots as R, the number of helmets as H, and the number of footballs as F.

Given that there are half as many robots as helmets, we can express this relationship as:

R = H/2

Additionally, we know that there are half as many helmets as footballs, which can be represented as:

H = F/2

We are also given that there are 20 helmets. Substituting this value into the second equation, we can solve for F:

F/2 = 20
F = 20 * 2
F = 40

Now that we have the value of F, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find R:

R = H/2
R = 20/2
R = 10

With the values of R and F determined, we can calculate the total number of items:

Total number of items = R + H + F
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends on calls in a week. Since he spends 6 hours per day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a single call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the additional time required for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings compared to the old varnish, we can calculate the difference in drying times.

Let's denote the time it takes for the old varnish to dry on one painting as T1 = 7 minutes, and the time for the new varnish as T2 = 12 minutes. We are interested in finding the difference in drying time for 6 paintings, which can be represented as 6T1 and 6T2.

The difference in drying time can be calculated as:

Δt = 6T2 - 6T1
= 6(12) - 6(7)
= 72 - 42
= 30 minutes

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the water requirements for each group of plants and summing them up.

First, we need to identify the number of plants in each category. Crista has 20 plants in total. Four plants require half a cup of water, eight plants require one cup of water, and the remaining plants require a quarter of a cup of water. To find the number of plants in the third category, we subtract the number of plants in the first two categories from the total: 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants.

Now, we can calculate the total water required for each category:

- Four plants need 0.5 cups of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.
- Eight plants need 1 cup of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 8 x 1 = 8 cups.
- Eight plants need 0.25 cups of water each, so the total water required for these plants is 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

To find the total amount of water needed, we sum the water requirements for each category: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the time it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we can employ the concept of average speed, as the distance covered on land and in water is equal. 

The total distance is 200 yards, and since half of it is on land and the other half is in water, the average speed can be calculated as:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
We know that the total distance is 200 yards, but we need to find the total time. Since the distance on land and in water is equal, we can set up an equation:

Time on land + Time in water = Total time
We can express the time on land and time in water in terms of the average speed (v) and the distance (d):

Time on land = d / v
Time in water = d / v
Since the distance on land and in water is equal, we can substitute d/2 for both expressions:

Time on land = d / v
Time in water = d / v
Total time = d / v + d / v
Total time = 2d / v

Now, we can substitute the given values:

Total time = 2(200 yards) / v
Total time = 400 yards / v

We are given the average speed (v) as 15 yards per minute (since 20 yards per minute for land and 10 yards per minute for water, the average speed is (20 + 10) / 2 = 15 yards per minute). 

Total time = 400 yards / 15 yards per minute
Total time = 400/15
Total time = 26.67 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{26.67}$"
"To determine the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for Bob's project, we can employ a straightforward division operation to calculate the number of boxes required.

Let's denote the number of popsicle sticks needed as N and the number of sticks per box as S. We are given that N = 56 and S = 8. To find the number of boxes needed, we can use the formula:

Number of boxes = N / S

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of boxes = 56 / 8
Number of boxes = 7

Since each box costs $2.00, the total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box:

Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box
Total cost = 7 × $2.00
Total cost = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To determine the total cost of the phone plan, we can employ a straightforward approach by breaking down the costs associated with the main phone and the additional phones.

Let's denote the cost of the main phone as M and the cost of each additional phone as A. We are given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so we can express this relationship as M = 2A.

We are also given that the main phone costs $20, so M = $20. Substituting this value into the equation M = 2A, we can solve for A:

$20 = 2A
A = $20 / 2
A = $10

Now that we know the cost of each additional phone, we can calculate the total cost of the additional phones by multiplying the cost of one additional phone by the number of additional phones:

Total cost of additional phones = 4A
= 4($10)
= $40

Finally, we can determine the total cost of the whole phone plan by adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = M + Total cost of additional phones
= $20 + $40
= $60

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60."
"To calculate Derrick's total earnings in June, we can employ the concept of unit conversion and multiplication. Since Derrick produces 10 dozen doughnuts per day, we can convert this to individual units by multiplying 10 dozen by 12, resulting in 120 doughnuts per day.

With a selling price of $2 per doughnut, Derrick's daily revenue can be calculated as 120 doughnuts/day * $2/doughnut = $240/day.

To determine his total earnings for the month of June, which has 30 days, we can multiply his daily revenue by the number of days: $240/day * 30 days = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick's total earnings in June are $7200.

The total cost of Alicia's dry-cleaning services in 5 weeks is $47.00."
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we must first determine his new speaking speed in words per minute. Given that his original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed increases by a factor of 2.5 after training, his new speed can be calculated as follows:

New speed = Original speed × 2.5
New speed = 150 WPM × 2.5
New speed = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages, with each page containing 450 words. The total number of words in 10 pages is:

Total words = Number of pages × Words per page
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words/page
Total words = 4500 words

Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM:

Time = Total words ÷ New speed
Time = 4500 words ÷ 375 WPM
Time = 12 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the problem into manageable parts. 

First, we need to determine the number of people on each day. On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were present, resulting in a total of 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.

For the remaining four days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these days, we can multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, we can add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To determine the total number of popped kernels, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals and calculate the number of kernels popped during each interval.

Let's denote the initial popping rate as r. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop, which can be expressed as 20 = r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 40 kernels per second.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increases to 3 times the initial rate, resulting in 3 * 40 = 120 kernels.

In the subsequent 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, leading to 4 * 40 = 160 kernels.

Finally, in the last 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, yielding 160 / 2 = 80 kernels.

To find the total number of kernels popped, we sum the kernels from each interval: 20 + 120 + 160 + 80 = 360 kernels.

However, a quarter of the kernels from the final 30 seconds also pop from residual heat. This can be calculated as (1/4) * 80 = 20 kernels.

Therefore, the total number of kernels is 360 + 20 = 380 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{380}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since Tim needs 5 gallons of lemonade in total, and each gallon necessitates 1 cup of lemon juice, we can calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed as follows:

5 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons required by dividing the total amount of lemon juice needed by the yield per 6 lemons:

5 cups ÷ 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 × 6/1 = 30 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the total amount of dog food required, we must consider the daily consumption of both breeds. Given that German Shepherds consume 5 kilograms of dog food per day and Bulldogs consume 3 kilograms of dog food per day, we can calculate the total daily consumption as follows:

Total daily consumption = (3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/dog) + (2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/dog)
Total daily consumption = 15 kg + 6 kg
Total daily consumption = 21 kg

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days
Total weekly consumption = 147 kg

Therefore, the Kennel house will require 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can employ a straightforward approach by calculating the total number of legs and then dividing by 2.

First, we calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of 2-legged animals by 2 and the number of 4-legged animals by 4, then summing the results.

Total legs = (10 * 2) + (15 * 4)
Total legs = 20 + 60
Total legs = 80

Now, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to obtain the total number of pairs of legs.

Total pairs of legs = Total legs / 2
Total pairs of legs = 80 / 2
Total pairs of legs = 40

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red blocks as 'r'. We know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, and the number of blue blocks is twice the number of yellow blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

The total number of blocks can be represented as the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks: 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) + r (red) = 32.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12 + r = 32.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation yields: r = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks in the tower is 20.

"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can utilize the concept of relative motion. Since Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, the distance covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 5 hours
= 90 miles

Subsequently, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed. The distance covered in this direction is:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 8 hours
= 144 miles

As Elvis travels east, he is essentially covering the same distance he initially traveled west. Therefore, the net distance from his house can be found by subtracting the initial distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Thus, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

Final answer: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we can apply the concept of depreciation, which is a reduction in the value of an asset over time due to various factors such as wear and tear, obsolescence, and market fluctuations.

The initial value of the boat is $9000. In the first year, it depreciates by 30%, which can be calculated as:

Depreciation in Year 1 = 30% of $9000 = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700

The value of the boat after the first year is:

Value after 1 year = Initial value - Depreciation in Year 1
= $9000 - $2700
= $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which can be calculated as:

Depreciation in Year 2 = 30% of $6300 = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890

The value of the boat after the second year is:

Value after 2 years = Value after 1 year - Depreciation in Year 2
= $6300 - $1890
= $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which can be calculated as:

Depreciation in Year 3 = 20% of $4410 = 0.2 * $4410 = $882

The value of the boat after the third year is:

Value after 3 years = Value after 2 years - Depreciation in Year 3
= $4410 - $882
= $3528

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

The final answer is: $3528"
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we can utilize the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Given that the total number of candies in the bag is 232, and we know the quantities of red, orange, and yellow candies, we can calculate the number of pink candies as follows:

Let's denote the number of red candies as R, orange candies as O, and yellow candies as Y. We are given that R = 54, O = 2R, and Y = R/2.

First, we calculate the total number of non-pink candies:
Total non-pink candies = R + O + Y
= 54 + 2(54) + (54/2)
= 54 + 108 + 27
= 189

Now, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
Number of pink candies = Total candies - Total non-pink candies
= 232 - 189
= 43

Therefore, the number of pink candies in the bag is 43."
"To determine the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the bus trips and add it to the cost of the hotel stays.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80. This can be calculated as:

Cost of one bus trip = 0.10 × $80
= $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:

Total cost of bus trips = $8 × 7
= $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

The total cost of the hotel and bus travels is the sum of these two costs:

Total cost = Cost of hotel stays + Total cost of bus trips
= $80 + $56
= $136

Therefore, Helen paid a total of $136 for her trip."
"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can utilize a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as 'x'. Since Dallas initially received 'x' marbles from Mazie and ended up with 21 after dropping 4, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 25

Solving for 'x', we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 25 - 4
x = 21

However, this equation doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that Dallas initially received 21 marbles. Let's re-evaluate the situation. We know that Mazie had 52 marbles initially and gave them to Dallas and Darla. Since Dallas ended up with 21 marbles, we can set up the equation:

52 - x = 21

Solving for 'x', we subtract 52 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 21 - 52
-x = -31
x = 31

Therefore, Mazie gave 31 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we can break down the expenses into two categories: ticket prices and popcorn costs.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there are two adults and one child, the total cost of the tickets can be calculated as follows:

Total ticket cost = (2 adult tickets) + (1 child ticket)
Total ticket cost = 2 × $12 + $8
Total ticket cost = $24 + $8
Total ticket cost = $32

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the popcorns. The cost of two popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:

Total popcorn cost = 2 × $3
Total popcorn cost = $6

Now, we can find the total cost of the outing by adding the total ticket cost and the total popcorn cost:

Total cost = Total ticket cost + Total popcorn cost
Total cost = $32 + $6
Total cost = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38 for their outing to the cinema.

The final answer is: $38"
"To determine the force required to move the car, we need to consider the total weight of the vehicle and its contents. The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, while the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds. Additionally, there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, resulting in a total weight of 150 pounds for the children.

The total weight of the vehicle and its contents can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600 pounds
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force required to move the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine the total length of crepe paper needed, we can utilize the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is given by P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

In this scenario, the length of the fence is 20 feet, and the width is 15 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P = 2(20 + 15)
P = 2(35)
P = 70

Therefore, James requires 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we can utilize the formula for calculating the mean of two numbers: 

Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Given that Mia is 16 years younger than Emma, we can express Emma's age as Mia's age + 16. Substituting this into the formula, we get:

Average = (Mia's age + (Mia's age + 16)) / 2
Average = (2Mia's age + 16) / 2
Average = (2Mia's age + 16) / 2
Average = Mia's age + 8

Since Mia is 40 years old, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Average = 40 + 8
Average = 48

Therefore, the average age of Mia and Emma is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells, we can employ a simple arithmetic operation. 

First, we add the number of seashells found by each individual: Tom (214) + Nancy (432) + Benny (86) = 732. 

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells (67) from the total to find the number of good seashells: 732 - 67 = 665.

Therefore, the total number of good seashells is 665.

The final answer is: $\boxed{665}$"
"To determine the total cost of the place settings, we can apply the principle of linear multiplication. 

The cost of 12 dinner plates at $6.00 each can be calculated as 12 * $6.00 = $72.00. Similarly, the cost of 12 salad plates at $4.00 each is 12 * $4.00 = $48.00. Lastly, the cost of 12 bowls at $5.00 each is 12 * $5.00 = $60.00.

We are also given that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, which can be expressed as A = (S/2) + 2. 

Substituting S = 10 into the equation, we get A = (10/2) + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

Therefore, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption by Dexter's pigs. Since each pig consumes 4 pounds of feed twice a day, the daily feed consumption per pig is 4 pounds * 2 = 8 pounds.

With 5 pigs, the total daily feed consumption is 8 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 40 pounds. To find the weekly feed consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days.

Weekly feed consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find the remaining feed, we subtract the total weekly consumption from the total ordered feed.

Remaining feed = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of hot dogs required for the party, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Given that each guest will consume 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, the total number of hot dogs needed can be calculated as follows:

Total hot dogs required = Number of guests * Number of hot dogs per guest
Total hot dogs required = 20 * 2
Total hot dogs required = 40

Considering John already has 4 hot dogs in stock, we need to adjust the total number of hot dogs required by subtracting these from the initial calculation:

Adjusted total hot dogs required = Total hot dogs required - Hot dogs already in stock
Adjusted total hot dogs required = 40 - 4
Adjusted total hot dogs required = 36

Now, to determine the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to purchase, we can divide the adjusted total by the number of hot dogs per pack (6):

Number of packs needed = Adjusted total hot dogs required / Number of hot dogs per pack
Number of packs needed = 36 / 6
Number of packs needed = 6

Finally, to calculate the total cost of the hot dogs, we multiply the number of packs needed by the cost per pack ($2):

Total cost = Number of packs needed * Cost per pack
Total cost = 6 * $2
Total cost = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"To determine Frances' remaining funds, we must first calculate her total revenue and total expenses.

Frances' revenue from cupcakes can be calculated as 20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40. Additionally, her revenue from cookies is 40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40. Therefore, her total revenue is $40 + $40 = $80.

Frances' expenses consist of the cost of 5 trays at $4 per tray, which equals 5 * $4 = $20.

To find Frances' remaining funds, we subtract her total expenses from her total revenue: $80 - $20 = $60.

Frances has $60 left.

"To determine the total number of children following the ice cream truck, we can model the situation using a sequence. Let's denote the initial number of children as a, the number of children added on the second street as b, and the number of children added on the third street as c.

We are given that a = 5, b = 5, and c = 2. The total number of children following the truck can be represented as a + b + c. However, we need to account for the fact that the original 5 children leave the group after the third street.

The correct formula to calculate the total number of children is:

a + b + c - a

This is because the original 5 children are subtracted from the total, as they are no longer following the truck.

Substituting the given values, we get:

5 + 5 + 2 - 5
= 7

Therefore, there are 7 children following the truck.

7"
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of meals distributed over the three days. This can be achieved by adding the number of meals given out on each day: 64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals.

Next, we subtract the total number of meals distributed from the initial total to find the number of meals remaining: 1,360 (total meals) - 142 (meals distributed) = 1,218 meals.

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

"To determine the total age of the siblings, we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. 

First, we know that the age of the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother. Let's denote the age of the younger brother as 'x'. Since the younger brother is 12 years old, we can set up the equation:

x = 12

Now, we can find the age of the older brother by multiplying 'x' by 2:

Age of older brother = 2x
= 2(12)
= 24

Next, we know that all three sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old. To find the total age of the siblings, we can add up the ages of all the siblings:

Total age = Age of younger brother + Age of older brother + (Age of one sister * 3)
= 12 + 24 + (16 * 3)
= 12 + 24 + 48
= 84

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we can break down the problem into two components: the time spent on meditation and the time spent on yoga.

First, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates for 15 minutes, twice a day, for 4 weeks, and 7 days a week. We can express this as:

Time spent on meditation = 2 * 15 * 7 * 4 = 840 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time spent on yoga from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

Time spent on yoga = 1 * 5 * 4 * 7 * 60 = 8400 minutes

Now, we can add the time spent on meditation and yoga to find the total time spent on both activities:

Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 840 + 8400 = 9240 minutes

To express this in a more conventional unit, we can convert the total time to hours by dividing by 60:

Total time spent on meditation and yoga = 9240 / 60 = 154 hours

Therefore, Charisma has spent a total of 154 hours on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks.

9240"

The area of a small t-shirt is 3 square feet, a medium t-shirt is 4 square feet, and a large t-shirt is 6 square feet. 

We can express this as an equation: 
Total area = (number of small shirts * area of small shirt) + (number of medium shirts * area of medium shirt) + (number of large shirts * area of large shirt)
Total area = (11 * 3) + (8 * 4) + (6 * 6)
Total area = 33 + 32 + 36
Total area = 101

Therefore, the quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we can employ a straightforward mathematical approach. 

First, we need to calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since 1 dozen is equivalent to 12, a small sunflower has 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.

Next, we calculate the additional seeds in a large sunflower, which is 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower. This can be computed as 36 * 0.5 = 18.

Now, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the additional seeds in the large sunflower (18) to obtain the total number of seeds: 36 + 18 = 54.

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is 54.

The final answer is: $\boxed{54}$"
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the number of pens owned by Timothy and George, and subsequently, Sarah.

Given that Timothy has three times the number of pens as George, and George has 18 pens, we can express this relationship as an equation:

T = 3G

where T represents the number of pens Timothy has, and G represents the number of pens George has.

Substituting the given value for G into the equation, we get:

T = 3(18)
T = 54

Now, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express this relationship as another equation:

S = (1/2)T

Substituting the value of T into this equation, we get:

S = (1/2)(54)
S = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

27"
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we can utilize the given information to establish a relationship between the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert.

Let's denote Jackie's height before the summer as x. We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so her current height is x + 3.

We are also given that Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36 inches tall. Therefore, Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72 inches.

Since Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, we can express this relationship as:

x + 3 = 72 - 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 3 = 70

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we find:

x = 70 - 3

x = 67

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches.

The final answer is: 67"
"To determine the total revenue generated by the company from selling chocolate bars over a two-week period, we can employ a straightforward calculation. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks. Since the company produces 5000 bars per day, we can multiply this rate by the number of days in two weeks (14 days).

Total bars produced = 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

Next, we can calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total number of bars produced by the selling price per bar, which is $2.

Total revenue = Total bars produced * Price per bar
Total revenue = 70,000 bars * $2/bar
Total revenue = $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

The final answer is: $140,000"
"To calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we can break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8, and Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Since it's a buy one get one 50% off deal, we can calculate the total cost of the T-shirts as follows:

Cost of T-shirts = (Cost of first T-shirt) + (Cost of second T-shirt)
= $8 + (50% of $8)
= $8 + (0.5 x $8)
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and Jake buys them at 40% off. We can calculate the discount as follows:

Discount on shoes = 40% of $40
= 0.4 x $40
= $16

Now, we can calculate the cost of the shoes as follows:

Cost of shoes = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store by adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

The final answer is: $36"

"To determine Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since Josh operates his car shop 6 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and services 3 cars per day, we can calculate the total number of cars serviced in 2 weeks as follows:

Number of days in 2 weeks = 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days
Number of days Josh is open = 6 days/week * 2 weeks = 12 days
Number of cars serviced in 2 weeks = 3 cars/day * 12 days = 36 cars

Given that Josh earns $4 per car, his total earnings over 2 weeks can be calculated as:

Total earnings = Number of cars serviced * Price per car
Total earnings = 36 cars * $4/car = $144

Therefore, Josh's total earnings over a 2-week period are $144."

"To determine the total amount Matthew would earn from selling his toy soldiers, we can calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them.

Since Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers, we can divide them into two equal halves. Each half consists of 6 toy soldiers.

The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for the first half and $7 per toy for the second half. We can calculate the total earnings from each half as follows:

Earnings from the first half: 6 toys * $5/toy = $30
Earnings from the second half: 6 toys * $7/toy = $42

Total earnings = Earnings from the first half + Earnings from the second half
Total earnings = $30 + $42
Total earnings = $72

Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $72 if he agrees to the buyer's offer."
"To solve this problem, we can employ a simple yet effective approach by considering the net change in the number of holes per day. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, resulting in a total of 84 holes. 

Let's denote the number of days it takes to fill in all the holes as 'x'. During this period, the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day, while Nate fills in 9 holes per day. Therefore, the net change in the number of holes per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

6 * 14 + 3 * (x - 14) = 0

This equation accounts for the initial 84 holes dug by the dog and the net change in the number of holes per day. Solving for 'x', we get:

84 + 3x - 42 = 0
3x = 42
x = 14

However, this solution is incorrect, as it assumes that the dog stops digging after Nate returns home. To accurately model the situation, we need to consider the ongoing digging by the dog. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to set up an equation that accounts for the net change in the number of holes per day, taking into account the ongoing digging by the dog:

6 * 14 + 3 * (x - 14) = 0

However, this equation is still not accurate, as it doesn't account for the fact that the dog continues to dig 6 holes per day after Nate starts filling in holes. A more accurate representation of the situation is:

6 * 14 + 3 * (x - 14) + 6 * (x - 14) = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

84 + 3x - 42 + 6x - 84 = 0
9x - 42 = 0
9x = 42
x = 42 / 9
x = 14/3
x = 4.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we can round up to the nearest whole number to ensure that all holes are filled. Therefore, it will take Nate approximately 5 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

The difference in average enrollment between the two schools can be found by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we can utilize the principle of subtraction. Given that the total number of cookies is 7995, and the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies is 2595 and 3075, respectively, we can calculate the number of chocolate chip cookies as follows:

Total cookies = Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies + Chocolate chip cookies
7995 = 2595 + 3075 + Chocolate chip cookies

Rearranging the equation to solve for the number of chocolate chip cookies, we get:

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
The total number of items Igor had is T + B + P, and we are told this equals 29. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

However, this is the number of beakers Igor should have gathered. Since Igor actually gathered the correct number of beakers, we need to find out how many beakers he lost. We know that he gathered 7 beakers, so the number of beakers he lost is:

7 - 5 = 2

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg requires 2 screws, the total number of screws needed can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables × Number of legs per table × Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 × 4 × 2
Total screws needed = 32

Given that James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations. Given that the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, we can express this relationship as a ratio or a mathematical expression.

Let's denote the number of eggs in the first basket as x. Since the second basket contains twice as many eggs, the number of eggs in the second basket can be represented as 2x.

The total number of eggs in both baskets can be calculated by adding the number of eggs in each basket:

Total = x + 2x
Total = 3x

Since we know that the first basket contains 10 eggs, we can substitute x = 10 into the equation:

Total = 3(10)
Total = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To determine the total amount of money raised, we can analyze the given information and apply basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the amount of money raised by Alexandra as A, Kim as K, Maryam as M, and Sarah as S. We are given the following information:

A = S + $400
K = A + $320
M = S + $400

We are also given the value of S: S = $300.

We can substitute the value of S into the equations for A and K:

A = $300 + $400 = $700
K = $700 + $320 = $1020

Now, we can find the value of M:

M = S + $400 = $300 + $400 = $700

To find the total amount of money raised, we can add the values of A, K, M, and S:

Total = A + K + M + S
= $700 + $1020 + $700 + $300
= $2020

Therefore, the total amount of money raised is $2020."
"To solve this problem, we can employ the concept of relative rates and proportions. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We are given that Aaron's speed is twice that of Vanessa's, so we can express this as A = 2V.

We also know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, while Aaron ran 2 miles. Since they completed their respective distances in the same amount of time, we can set up a proportion to relate their speeds and distances:

A / 2 = V / 4

Substituting A = 2V into the proportion, we get:

2V / 2 = V / 4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

V = 4

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by dividing the distance by her speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles/minute
Time = 1 minute

Therefore, Vanessa took 1 minute to complete her part of the race.

"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can employ a straightforward calculation. Since the caretaker requires 3 feet of line for every foot of dock and there are 200 feet of dock, the total length of line required can be calculated as follows:

Total line required = 3 feet/dock * 200 feet of dock
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already possesses 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line he needs to purchase, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required:

Total line to purchase = Total line required - line already available
Total line to purchase = 600 feet - 6 feet
Total line to purchase = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"To calculate the weekly revenue of Tom's restaurant, we can employ a straightforward approach by multiplying the daily revenue by the number of days the restaurant is open. 

First, we need to determine the total daily revenue. Given that the restaurant receives 6 reservations per night, with each reservation consisting of 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (6 reservations * 2 meals per reservation * $5 per meal) + $5 per day
= (6 * 2 * $5) + $5
= $60 + $5
= $65 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, we can then calculate the weekly revenue by multiplying the daily revenue by 2:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $65 * 2
= $130 per week

The final answer is: $130"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can employ the concept of percentage increase. Given that the fruit vendor sold all 50 watermelons at a profit of 25%, we can calculate the selling price per unit using the following formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)

In this scenario, the cost price of 50 watermelons is $80. To find the cost price of one watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of units:

Cost Price per Watermelon = Total Cost / Number of Watermelons
= $80 / 50
= $1.60

Now, we can calculate the selling price per watermelon by adding the profit percentage to the cost price:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Cost Price per Watermelon + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price per Watermelon)
= $1.60 + (0.25 * $1.60)
= $1.60 + $0.40
= $2.00

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

The final answer is: $2.00"
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we need to find the current age of James. Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate James' current age as follows:

Let's denote Dora's current age as D. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we can set up the equation: D + 3 = 12. Solving for D, we get D = 12 - 3 = 9.

Now that we know Dora's current age, we can find James' current age, which is twice Dora's age: James' current age = 2 * D = 2 * 9 = 18.

Next, we need to find John's current age. We know that James was born when John was 19 years old, and James is currently 18 years old. So, John's current age can be calculated as: John's current age = 19 + 18 = 37.

Finally, we need to find John's youngest son's current age. We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son's current age can be calculated as: John's youngest son's current age = 37 - 32 = 5.

To find John's youngest son's age in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age: John's youngest son's age in 3 years = 5 + 3 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can apply the concept of relative rates. Let's denote the number of oranges Ana peels per minute as A and the number of oranges Jane peels per minute as J. We are given that A = 1/3 and J = 1/4.

The relative rate at which Ana peels oranges is A/J = (1/3)/(1/4) = 4/3. This means that for every 4 oranges Jane peels, Ana peels 3.

Since they start peeling at the same time, we can set up an equation to represent the number of oranges each person peels in 1 hour (60 minutes). Let's denote the number of oranges Ana peels as x and the number of oranges Jane peels as y. We can write the equation:

x = (4/3)y

We know that in 60 minutes, Jane peels 15 oranges, so we can substitute y = 15 into the equation:

x = (4/3)(15)
x = 20

Therefore, Ana peels 20 oranges in 1 hour.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to consider the discounted price and the labor costs.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Mark obtains it at an 80% discount, which equates to a reduction of $320 (80% of $400). Therefore, the discounted price of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is $50 per hour, and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Thus, the total labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is the sum of the discounted radiator price and the labor cost, which is $80 + $150 = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can employ a basic algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We are given that the total number of animals is 20, so we can express this as an equation:

x + y = 20

We are also given that the total number of legs is 70. Since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, we can set up another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now, we have a system of linear equations. We can solve for x by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70
2(x + y) = 40
2x + 2y = 40

Subtracting this equation from the second equation:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
2y = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:

y = 15

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

Therefore, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

First, we calculate the total number of slices: 7 pizzas × 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices ÷ 4 people = 14 slices/person.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
