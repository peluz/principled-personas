"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet's daily egg production is 16 eggs. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.

Next, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her remaining eggs to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, her daily earnings can be calculated as:

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"To determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of blue and white fiber separately.

The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber. Since it takes half that much white fiber, we can calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:

White fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

Now, we can find the total number of bolts by adding the blue and white fiber:

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the profit made by Josh after flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Number of meters per sprint: 60

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"As a poultry nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Wendi's chicken feeding schedule.

To determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to calculate the total daily feed requirement and subtract the feed already provided.

Wendi's flock consists of 20 chickens, and each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. The total daily feed requirement can be calculated as:

Total daily feed = Number of chickens * Feed per chicken
Total daily feed = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken
Total daily feed = 60 cups

Since Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed, we can subtract that from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal:

Final meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed already provided
Final meal feed = 60 cups - 40 cups
Final meal feed = 20 cups

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, while subsequent glasses are 60% of the price of the first glass. 

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"Sheep population calculations can be simplified by following a step-by-step approach. Let's break it down:

First, we know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

Next, we need to find the number of sheep in Toulouse. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we multiply Charleston's sheep by 2: 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the interrupted download. Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. 

Time taken for the first download = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes.

The download is then interrupted and restarted. The second download also takes 80 minutes.

Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes = 160 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down the journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled during the 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

The total distance John traveled is the sum of these segments:
Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to consider her regular and overtime pay rates.

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked 40 hours at this rate. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour. She worked 5 hours of overtime.

Earnings for the first 40 hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Earnings for the overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week: $400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the number of downloads in the first month as D1, the number of downloads in the second month as D2, and the number of downloads in the third month as D3.

We are given that D1 = 60.

D2 is three times the number of downloads in the first month, so D2 = 3 * D1 = 3 * 60 = 180.

D3 is 30% less than D2, so D3 = 0.7 * D2 = 0.7 * 180 = 126.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of D1, D2, and D3: Total = D1 + D2 + D3 = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost, we can break down the cost of each item and add them together.

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the annual expenses are $3. The tree grows 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.50 each.

Net profit per year = (7 lemons/year * $1.50/lemon) - $3/year
Net profit per year = $10.50 - $3
Net profit per year = $7.50

To find the break-even point, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

Break-even point = Initial cost / Net profit per year
Break-even point = $90 / $7.50
Break-even point = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the lemon tree to break even.

Final answer: 12"
"As a seasoned door-to-door saleswoman, I've encountered my fair share of complex sales scenarios. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can start by setting up an equation.

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie initially had as x. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms: x - x/3 - x/6 - 1 = 5

To simplify, find a common denominator (6): 6x/6 - 2x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 5 + 1

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 6

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 4x - 6 = 36

Add 6 to both sides: 4x = 42

Divide both sides by 4: x = 42/4

x = 10.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the correct answer is not a whole number, but we can re-evaluate the problem.

"To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. 

First, we find the percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students is 0.2 * 20 = 4 students.

The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students. Then, 25% of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, which is 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

The number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the remaining students after subtracting those in contemporary and jazz dance: 16 - 4 = 12 students.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"As a financial analyst specializing in investment and market trends, I've analyzed the potential returns on both options. To maximize profit, we need to consider the projected market growth for each asset.

The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, resulting in a potential value of $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,250.

On the other hand, the electronic gadgets market is anticipated to rise by 1.2%, leading to a potential value of $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,160.

To determine the best choice, we compare the potential values. Since $8,160 is greater than $5,250, the electronic gadgets offer a higher potential value.

The profit from the electronic gadgets would be $8,160 - $8,000 = $160.

The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

Final Answer: The final answer is $160."
"As a transportation engineer specializing in rail network analysis, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the distances covered by each train.

Since the two trains left San Rafael at the same time and traveled westward for 80 miles each, we can consider this as the initial leg of their journey. The next day, they traveled northward, covering a combined distance of 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on both days. Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered on both days:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"As a financial analyst specializing in salary calculations, I'll break down Jill's annual salary into two components: teaching and coaching.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply her hourly wages by the number of hours worked per week and then multiply the result by the number of weeks worked in a year.

Earnings from teaching: 
- Hourly wage: $20
- Hours worked per week: 35
- Weekly earnings: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Earnings from coaching:
- Hourly wage: $30
- Hours worked per week: 15
- Weekly earnings: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Total annual salary: $35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

Final answer: $57,500"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. Claire makes 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will make 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs):
84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for Marissa to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can use the concept of average speed and the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the desired average speed (4 miles per hour) and the total distance (12 miles). We also know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. 

Let's denote the time spent walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be the sum of the time spent walking the first 6 miles (2 hours) and the time spent walking the remaining distance (t hours).

Total Time = 2 + t

We can set up the equation using the average speed formula:

4 = 12 / (2 + t)

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t):

4(2 + t) = 12

Expanding the equation:

8 + 4t = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

4t = 4

Dividing both sides by 4:

t = 1

Now that we know the time spent walking the remaining distance (1 hour), we can calculate the required speed:

Required Speed = Distance / Time
= 6 miles / 1 hour
= 6 miles per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to calculate the total amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks before and after spilling.

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
17/3 + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 ÷ 3 = 14.67

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son.

Let's denote Raymond's current age as R and his son's age as S. We know that R = 25 (since Raymond is 25 years old) and S = 23 (since Raymond had a son at the age of 23).

The number of years ago Raymond's son was born can be calculated as: R - S = 25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: 2"
"To calculate the total number of DVDs sold, we can break down the sales into separate groups and add them together.

First, we'll calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers. Since each of them bought one DVD, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 3.

Next, we'll calculate the number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers. Each of them bought 2 DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 2 x 2 = 4.

Finally, we'll calculate the number of DVDs sold to the last 3 customers. Since none of them bought any DVDs, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 0.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"As a candle expert, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the melting loss of the candle.

To find the total number of centimeters the candle melts, we need to calculate the time difference between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the 4-hour difference to minutes and then divide by 60 to get the total minutes.

4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Now, we can calculate the melting loss by dividing the total minutes by 60 (since the candle melts 2 cm every 60 minutes):

240 minutes / 60 = 4

The candle will be 4 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the original price of the book, we can use the formula:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. 

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items and subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total cost of the clothing items, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Shorts x Price per Short) + (Number of Pants x Price per Pant) + (Number of Shoes x Price per Shoe)

Given:
- Number of Shorts = 3
- Price per Short = $16.50
- Number of Pants = 3
- Price per Pant = $22.50
- Number of Shoes = 3
- Price per Shoe = $42

Total Cost = (3 x $16.50) + (3 x $22.50) + (3 x $42)
Total Cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
Total Cost = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To calculate the total cost of ice cream for Cynthia, we need to determine the number of cartons she will purchase and multiply it by the cost per carton.

Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will need 60 servings in 60 days. 

60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

The cost of each carton is $4.00. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:

4 cartons * $4.00 per carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry's first stop was 20 miles into the trip, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

Let's break it down:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, since the second stop is before the end of the trip, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. This would result in a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. 

Instead, we should consider the distance from the first stop to the second stop as the distance between the two points. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop: 20 + 15 = 35 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can start by finding the total cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, the cost of the boots can be found by subtracting $5 from the total cost of the heels: $99 - $5 = $94.

Therefore, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x.

We are given that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To calculate the average guess, we need to find the total number of jelly beans and then divide it by the number of guesses.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"As a canine care specialist, I can provide a detailed analysis of the time spent on dog care. To calculate the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can calculate the total daily care time as follows:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To determine the weekly care time, we multiply the daily care time by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's dive into the world of coin counting and algebra to solve this problem.

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which equals 110. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we need to determine the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25.

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4
= 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To calculate Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Yogurts Consumed * Cost per Yogurt

Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day and the sale price is 4 yogurts for $5, we can first find the cost of one yogurt:

Cost per Yogurt = $5 / 4 = $1.25

Now, we can calculate the total number of yogurts consumed in 30 days:

Number of Yogurts Consumed = 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Finally, we can find the total cost:

Total Cost = 60 yogurts * $1.25 = $75

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the initial amount of money he had and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

He had $5 left after buying the video games, so the amount he spent on video games and had left is $195 - $160 = $35.

Since he had $35 left after buying the video games, we can infer that he initially had $35 + $5 = $40.

Now, we know John initially had $40 and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, the question asks how many Lego sets he still has. Since he initially had 13 Lego sets and sold them all, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The correct answer is: 0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total weekly running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

Since John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate his total weekly running time as follows:

Total weekly running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total weekly running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total weekly running time = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Dana's running speed and walking speed.

Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since she spends 6 hours in total, she spends 6 / 3 = 2 hours running and 6 / 3 = 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance she travels while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as D.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S = 2(1) = 2.

Finally, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B = 4(2) = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone is three times her throwing distance without the gemstone. Let's denote the throwing distance without the gemstone as x. Then, the throwing distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1200.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 1200 / 3 = 400.

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames. This distance is the difference between the throwing distance with the gemstone (3x) and the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet): 3x - 1000.

Substituting the value of x, we get: 3(400) - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. We also know that the remaining pieces are 14. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests can be calculated as: P = T - remaining pieces
P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then find the corresponding weight.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find the number of servings you can have.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 * 300 = 240g

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"As a seasoned entrepreneur in the candle-making industry, I can attest that Charlie's business is off to a great start. To calculate his net profit, we need to consider the cost of materials and the revenue generated from selling the candles.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he sells 20 candles. The total revenue is:

Total Revenue = Number of Candles * Price per Candle
Total Revenue = 20 Candles * $2.00 per Candle
Total Revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks, which costs $10.00. Since he makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, the cost per candle is:

Cost per Candle = Total Cost / Number of Candles
Cost per Candle = $10.00 / 10 Candles
Cost per Candle = $1.00

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

Total Cost = Number of Candles * Cost per Candle
Total Cost = 20 Candles * $1.00 per Candle
Total Cost = $20.00

Finally, we can calculate the net profit:

Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00
Net Profit = $20.00

The final answer is: $20."
"As a freelance blogger specializing in health topics, I've analyzed Meredith's writing schedule to calculate the total hours spent on articles. To do this, I'll break down her writing activities for each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, each taking 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. With each article taking 4 hours, the total hours spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total hours spent writing articles in the three days, I'll add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. We know that Candice initially had 80 notes, used 220 notes at work, and had 23 notes remaining.

We can set up the equation: 80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides, we get: x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can represent the number of blue ties as 'x'. This means the number of red ties is 2x.

The cost of a blue tie is $40, and the cost of a red tie is 50% more than the blue tie. We can represent the cost of a red tie as 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on blue ties is $200, so we can set up the equation:
40x = 200

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 40:
x = 200 / 40
x = 5

Now that we know the number of blue ties (x = 5), we can find the number of red ties:
2x = 2 * 5
2x = 10

The total amount spent on blue ties is $200, and the total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = $600.

The total amount spent on ties is the sum of the amount spent on blue ties and red ties:
Total = 200 + 600
Total = 800

"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units and then find the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"As an expert in poultry farming and egg production, I can provide a detailed analysis of Lloyd's egg farm.

To calculate the weekly revenue from egg sales, we need to consider the daily production and the selling price per dozen. Let's break it down:

Daily egg production: 252 eggs
Weekly egg production: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since eggs are sold by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, let's calculate the weekly revenue:
147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

"To determine the time it takes for Tom to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Given that Tom travels at 10 miles per hour from 1 to 4 PM and then returns at 6 miles per hour, we need to calculate the distance first. Since he travels for 3 hours at 10 mph, the distance is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, we can find the time it takes for him to get back:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of toys as 'x'. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, the total weight of the toys is 0.5x pounds. We know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. He has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, so the remaining weight is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. This remaining weight is comprised of the weight of the toys. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

0.5x = 7.5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.5:

x = 7.5 / 0.5
x = 15

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"As a seasoned mechanic with extensive experience in tire repair, I can analyze the given scenario to determine the day with higher revenue.

To calculate the total revenue for each day, we need to consider the number of truck tires and car tires repaired. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, Friday's revenue ($480) is greater than Thursday's revenue ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is $40."
"As a feline behaviorist, I can provide an expert analysis of the situation. The Doubtfire family has adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. 

To determine the total number of kittens, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat had. Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens as 3 * 12 = 36.

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 36 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 48 kittens.

The Doubtfire family now has a total of 48 kittens.

Final Answer: The final answer is 48."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. This leaves 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds available for the weight of the boxes.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes as follows:

Maximum number of boxes = Available weight for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 pounds / 15 pounds
= 16.33

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the total weight does not exceed the bridge's limit. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. 

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, construction, and insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be calculated as 0.10 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

Therefore, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch.

The final answer is: $1430"
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two phases of her pension plan.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. This is a straightforward calculation:

Annual pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

Annual pension after 20 years = $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years. We can calculate the total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years as:

Annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
Annual pension due to the 5% increase = $1,000,000 * 5% * 10 years = $50,000
Total annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:

Total annual pension = $1,000,000 + $550,000 = $1,550,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:

Average annual pension = $1,550,000 / 30 years = $51,666.67

The final answer is: $51,666.67"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to consider the monthly subscription fee and the discount applied to the second half of the year.

The monthly subscription fee is $140. For the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 months of this amount:
140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged her 10% less money. This discount is calculated as:
140 * 0.1 = $14

The discounted amount for the second half of the year is:
140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, Aleena paid:
126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:
$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can help Sophia determine how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. To do this, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her vehicle.

We know that Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. To find the remaining capacity, we subtract the used amount from the total capacity:

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon by dividing the miles traveled by the remaining gallons:

100 miles ÷ 8 gallons = 12.5 miles per gallon

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles per gallon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To calculate the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the hours spent watching TV as T and the hours spent reading as R. We know that T = 2 hours and R = 0.5T (since he reads for half the time he spends watching TV). 

The total hours spent on TV and reading each week is T + R = 2 + 0.5T = 2.5T. 

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 2.5T * 3 = 7.5T.

We are given that this pattern repeats for 4 weeks. To find the total hours spent in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4: 7.5T * 4 = 30T.

Since T = 2 hours, the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 30 * 2 = 60 hours.

The final answer is: 60"
"In the context of basketball tournaments, let's break down the problem to determine the total number of people sent by the schools.

Each school has two teams: a girls' team and a boys' team, with 5 players on each team. This results in a total of 10 players per school. Since there are four schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Additionally, each school has sent a coach for each team, adding 2 coaches per school. With 4 schools, the total number of coaches is 2 coaches per school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

To find the total number of people sent by the schools, we add the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

"As a gemstone expert, I can analyze the given information to determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest.

Let's break down the information:

- Number of diamonds = 175
- Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
- Number of emeralds = 2 * Number of rubies = 2 * 140 = 280

To find the total number of gems, we can add the number of each type of gemstone:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595."

"To calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones, we need to consider the interest charged on each unit. The interest for each unit is 2% of the cost, which is $150. This can be calculated as:

Interest per unit = 2% of $150 = 0.02 x $150 = $3

Since Shiela bought 5 cell phones, the total interest for all units is:

Total interest = 5 x $3 = $15

The total amount Shiela will pay for each cell phone per month is the cost of the cell phone plus the interest, which is $150 + $3 = $153.

To find the total amount Shiela will pay for 3 months, we multiply the monthly amount by 3:

Total amount for 3 months = $153 x 3 = $459

"As a geology expert, I can analyze the problem from a spatial perspective. The sandcastle's levels form a geometric sequence, where each level's area is half the area of the level below it. Given that the top level has an area of 16 square units, we can calculate the areas of the subsequent levels.

Let's denote the area of the top level as A1 = 16. Since each level has half the area of the level below it, we can express the areas of the subsequent levels as:

A2 = A1 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
A3 = A2 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4
A4 = A3 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

To find the average area, we sum the areas of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

Average area = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) / 4
= (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To determine the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days and the amount used for the rest of the year.

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the first 180 days is:
1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the rest of the year (365 - 180 = 185 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of food used in the rest of the year is:
2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to first determine the amount of laundry each person does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up an equation to find David's laundry:

Let's denote David's laundry as x. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400 / 4
x = 100

Now that we know David's laundry, we can find Raymond's laundry, which is half of Sarah's laundry:

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:

Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100

Therefore, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"To determine the amount of water left, we need to calculate the total amount of water initially and then subtract the water given to the girls and the boy.

The total amount of water is 24 liters. Since the two girls each received 1/6 of the water, we can calculate the total amount of water they received as follows:

(1/6) × 24 = 24/6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received is 4 + 4 = 8 liters.

Now, we subtract the water the boy received (6 liters) from the total:

24 - 8 - 6 = 10 liters

Therefore, there are 10 liters of water left.

Total number of thorns = 3 * 25 * 8
Total number of thorns = 600

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"In the context of probability and statistics, we can approach this problem using a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we have found the number of games lost, we can determine the number of games won by adding 8 to x:

Number of games won = x + 8

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"As a salary increase expert, I can confidently calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service.

To calculate the annual salary, we'll apply the 10% increase to the previous year's salary. 

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683

"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pets Cindy has as 'x'. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia's pets can be represented as x + 2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan's pets can be represented as 3(x + 2).

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so x = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pets, we get:

Marcia's pets: 4 + 2 = 6
Jan's pets: 3(4 + 2) = 3(6) = 18

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to create a system of equations. Let's denote the ages of the siblings as follows: Amy (A), Jackson (J), Corey (C), and James (Jm).

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey, so we can write an equation: Jm = C - 1.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so we can write another equation: A = C - 2.

Lastly, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so we can write the third equation: A = J + 5.

Now, we can substitute the expression for A from the third equation into the first equation: Jm = (J + 5) - 1.

Since we know Jm = 10, we can substitute this value into the equation: 10 = (J + 5) - 1.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 = J + 4.

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get: J = 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentage increase. Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x'. Since Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:

Lee's time = Gerald's time + 2
38 = x + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
x = 38 - 2
x = 36 seconds

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by dividing his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement).
Gerald's new time = 36 / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 32.73 seconds

The final answer is 32.73."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can use the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. If we let D represent the number of dogs and C represent the number of cats, we can express this relationship as:

R = D + C - 12

We are also given that there are two cats for every dog, so we can write:

C = 2D

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

R = D + 2D - 12
R = 3D - 12

We are told that the number of dogs is 60, so we can substitute D = 60 into the equation:

R = 3(60) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168

Now that we know the number of rabbits, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = D + C + R
= 60 + 120 + 168
= 348

"To determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can use a simple subtraction approach. Let's denote the total number of cars as T, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x, and the number of cars that took an exit as e.

We know that T = x + (20 - e), since 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. We are also given that T = 30 and e = 5.

Substituting these values, we get:
30 = x + (20 - 5)
30 = x + 15
x = 30 - 15
x = 15

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 15.

Final Answer: The final answer is 15."
"As a gardening expert, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the number of potted plants Mary will have left.

Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, resulting in a total of:
2 * 40 = 80 potted plants

She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family, so she will give away 40 plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had:
80 - 40 = 40

Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we must first calculate the total number of pages from all the textbooks. 

The total number of pages is the sum of the pages from each textbook: 
4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:
39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces. The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. To find a third of 750, we can divide 750 by 3: 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

The number of pieces left to be placed is the remaining pieces after her mom's turn: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is 500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. If Amir eats 5 cookies, we can represent this as a ratio: 5 cookies for Amir to 3 cookies for Cody. To find the total number of cookies eaten by both, we can add the number of cookies eaten by each.

Let's use algebra to represent this situation: Let A be the number of cookies eaten by Amir and C be the number of cookies eaten by Cody. We know that C = 3A and A = 5. We can substitute the value of A into the equation for C: C = 3(5) = 15. Now, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by adding A and C: Total = A + C = 5 + 15 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to analyze his TV viewing schedule.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.

The total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 30 minutes to find the number of episodes: 90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes = 3.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

To calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find Julia's rowing speed. We know that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. 

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can find the rate at which the boat takes on water as follows:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Now, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the number of teachers, lessons per day, and the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson.

Given that each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, the total number of lessons per day is 4 (number of teachers) x 2 (lessons per day) = 8 lessons per day.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 8 (total lessons per day) x 3 (cleanings per lesson) = 24.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To calculate the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can use the formula for simple multiplication. 

Total flowers = Number of flowers planted per day * Number of days

"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to establish the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and the capacity of Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can express this as:

Number of photographs on Jamal's phone = 6 × Number of photographs on Brittany's phone

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

1800 = 6 × Number of photographs on Brittany's phone

To find the number of photographs on Brittany's phone, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

Number of photographs on Brittany's phone = 1800 / 6
= 300

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. We can express this relationship as:

300 = 50x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
= 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue from selling the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $100 + $80 = $180.

The prices have increased by 50%, so the selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each.

The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not required, we can directly focus on the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to total parts is 7/20. We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the equation:

7/20 = 120/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7x = 20 * 120
7x = 2400

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 2400 / 7
x = 342.86 (approximately)

So, Katy used approximately 343 teaspoons of sugar."
"To calculate the total amount John paid for the shoes, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Pairs * Cost per Pair

Given:
Number of Pairs = 2
Cost per Pair = $60
Number of Children = 3

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, we multiply the number of pairs by the number of children:

Total Pairs = 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we multiply the total pairs by the cost per pair:

Total Cost = 6 * $60
Total Cost = $360

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple arithmetic sequence where we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day.

We know that initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, resulting in a total of 10 vehicles. On the second day, the total number of vehicles increased to 30. To find the number of vehicles added, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the final number:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can divide the number of vehicles added by 5 to find the number of containers imported on the second day:

20 vehicles ÷ 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to consider their individual salary increases.

First, we'll calculate Adrien's current salary. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

Adrien's old salary = $40000
30% of Adrien's old salary = 0.3 * $40000 = $12000
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $12000 = $52000

Next, we'll calculate Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we'll calculate Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of Lylah's old salary = 0.4 * $30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $52000 + $43077.92
Total salary = $95077.92"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets used in a month. Since there are 2 pads of paper used per week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of pads per week by the number of weeks per month.

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters. This means that the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 30.

To find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to consider the fact that Jennie stamped 20 letters. Since the number of letters in the pile now is 30, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Initial number of letters in the pile + 20 (stamped letters) = 30 (current number of letters in the pile)

Let's denote the initial number of letters in the pile as x. We can rewrite the equation as:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

Therefore, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package as x.

We know that Julia initially bought a package of spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

The total number of friends they have together is 120."
"As a black belt in mathematics, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the cost of a pepper as P, the cost of a watermelon as W, and the cost of an orange as O. We're given that P = 15. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, we can express the cost of a watermelon as W = 3P = 3(15) = 45. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so O = W - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4W = 4(45) = 180
- 20 peppers: 20P = 20(15) = 300
- 10 oranges: 10O = 10(40) = 400

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880.

"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments.

Let's break down the calculation:

Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

Total revenue from doctors:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Total revenue: $100,000 + $30,000 = $130,000

Since there is no cost mentioned for the hospital, the profit is simply the total revenue.

The hospital makes a profit of $130,000."

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, which translates to 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Since she also rode the luge 2 times, the total tickets used by Pam is 12 + 2 * 6 = 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, which is equivalent to 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. He also rode the luge 2 times, adding another 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. Therefore, the total tickets used by Fred is 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.

The combined total number of tickets used by both Pam and Fred is 24 + 36 = 60 tickets.

The final answer is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. This means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Let's denote the miles walked on Wednesday as x. We can set up the equation:

28 + x = 41

To solve for x, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:

x = 41 - 28
x = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic equation. We know that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. If we let B represent the number of blue gumballs, we can write the equation as:

Number of pink gumballs = 4B + 22

We're given that the number of blue gumballs is 12. To find the number of pink gumballs, we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

Number of pink gumballs = 4(12) + 22
= 48 + 22
= 70

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"In the context of apiculture, understanding the dynamics between the different bee populations within a hive is crucial for effective management. By applying the principles of bee biology, we can determine the number of worker bees.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies (immature bees) as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. Furthermore, there are twice as many worker bees as babies, making the number of worker bees 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Given that the total number of bees is 700, we can set up the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. Combining like terms yields 7Q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7 results in Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can calculate the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To calculate Jordan's potential earnings if he spent his video game time working, we need to consider the total hours he would work in a week. 

Since Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, in a week (7 days) he would work 2 * 7 = 14 hours.

As a part-time worker, Jordan earns $10 an hour. Therefore, his total earnings in a week would be 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

In conclusion, if Jordan spent his video game time working, he would earn $140 in a week.

Final answer: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost of everything: $11 (non-food items) + $5 (food items) = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"As a financial analyst specializing in small business operations, I've assessed Kim's housekeeping business to determine its potential profit. To calculate the profit, we need to consider the total expenses and total income.

Kim's expenses consist of bleach and cloths for each client. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. With 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach required is 8 * 2 = 16. The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. Similarly, the total number of packs of cloths required is 8, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"As a horticulturist specializing in tropical fruit cultivation, I can provide a precise calculation for the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year.

To determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest, we need to consider the yield per hectare and the frequency of harvesting. Given that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field with 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year as follows:

Total pineapples per year = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year (since John harvests every 3 months)

Total pineapples per year = 10 * 100 * 4
Total pineapples per year = 400 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 400 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny needs to pick up, we can break it down into three separate calculations.

First, we have the initial 500-piece box. Then, we have a box with 3 times more pieces, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. Lastly, we have a box with 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, which is 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

First, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of these bees return, which is 15 bees. This leaves 30 - 15 = 15 bees that haven't returned yet.

In the next 6 hours, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. These bees haven't returned yet, so we add them to the 15 bees that were still out: 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 75 bees are still out. Therefore, 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can use the given information that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as D. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up the equation:

Charlie's friends = 3D
12 = 3D

To solve for D, we can divide both sides by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4:

James' friends = 4D
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to cover their respective distances.

Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
Steve's speed: 440 feet/minute
Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Tim's speed: 264 feet/minute
Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between their times to determine how long Tim will be waiting for Steve.

Time Tim will be waiting = Tim's time - Steve's time
Time Tim will be waiting = 40 minutes - 36 minutes
Time Tim will be waiting = 4 minutes

"As a bike inflation expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made that day.

To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire. 

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

"As a financial analyst specializing in retail transactions, I can break down the problem into a straightforward calculation.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, with each pack containing 6 cookies. The cost of each cookie is $0.10. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cookies per pack and then by the cost per cookie:

Total cost = (10 packs * 6 cookies/pack) * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie
Total cost = $6

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill to find the change:

Change = $10 - $6
Change = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"The problem at hand involves a series of events that affect the quantity of french fries in a pack. To determine the initial amount of fries, we can work backwards through the sequence of events.

First, we know that ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. This implies that before the ants, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Next, a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries. Let's denote the remaining fries as 'x'. Then, 1/3 of 'x' is 5. To find 'x', we can multiply both sides by 3, resulting in x = 5 * 3 = 15.

Now, we know that the raccoon ate 2/3 of the fries, so the remaining fries after the raccoon ate 2/3 is 1/3 of the original amount. Let's denote the original amount as 'y'. Then, 1/3 of 'y' is 15. To find 'y', we can multiply both sides by 3, resulting in y = 15 * 3 = 45.

Three pigeons then ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is 45 - 9 = 36.

Finally, a seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. The remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is 36 - 7 = 29.

Therefore, the initial amount of fries in the pack was 29 + 14 = 43.

The final answer is: $\boxed{43}$"
"As a student of scheduling and time management, I can break down Kimo's class schedule into manageable parts to calculate the total number of hours he spends attending classes.

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which amounts to 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day. Since there are 3 days, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days. In a 16-week semester, he spends 9 * 16 = 144 hours on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each, totaling 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day. With 2 days, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. In a 16-week semester, he spends 8 * 16 = 128 hours on these days.

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes, we add the hours from both sets of days: 144 + 128 = 272 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{272}$"
"To calculate the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert the length of each type of baked good to feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, let's convert the length of the croissants to feet:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are already in feet, so we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in managing primate populations, I can confidently calculate the total number of bananas required for the apes.

To determine the total number of bananas needed, we must consider the monthly consumption of each species. The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption of each species by 2:

Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs a total distance of 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs a total distance of 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"

Now, let's add the costs together: $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on everything."
"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to consider the initial count and the changes that occurred.

Finn initially observed 11 tadpoles in the pond. Then, 6 tadpoles emerged from under a lily pad, and 2 tadpoles hid under a rock. To find the current number of tadpoles Finn can see, we subtract the number of tadpoles that hid from the initial count.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see:
11 (initial tadpoles) - 6 (tadpoles that emerged) = 5
Since 2 tadpoles hid, we don't need to add or subtract anything else.

The current number of tadpoles Finn can see is 5.

"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach. 

Given that the tank had 17 feet of water on Monday and 7 feet more water on Tuesday, we can calculate the depth on Tuesday as follows:

Depth on Tuesday = Depth on Monday + 7 feet
Depth on Tuesday = 17 feet + 7 feet
Depth on Tuesday = 24 feet

Now, we need to find two thirds of the depth on Tuesday to determine the depth on Wednesday. We can calculate this as follows:

Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * Depth on Tuesday
Depth on Wednesday = (2/3) * 24 feet
Depth on Wednesday = 16 feet

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's break down the information given in the problem.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Lastly, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

To find the total number of fish caught, we need to add up the number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin. 

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

"The problem of exponential growth can be modeled using the formula for compound interest, where the initial price (P) is $20, the monthly increase rate (r) is 20% or 0.20, and the number of periods (n) is 36 months. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the final price.

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^36
A = 20(1.20)^36
A = 20(6.656)
A = 132.12

The final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $132.12.

"To determine the total cost of all toys, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15

"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We are given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Seth's current age as x, then Brooke's current age is x/2.

In 2 years, Seth's age will be x + 2, and Brooke's age will be x/2 + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify the equation, we can combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

Therefore, Seth's current age is 16.

"As a financial analyst specializing in debt management, I've assessed Jessica's debt obligations to determine the optimal payment plan. To calculate the total annual payment, we'll first calculate the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 12.

Jessica's minimum payments are as follows:
- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Total minimum payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

To determine the increased payment, we'll calculate 50% of the total minimum payment:
50% of $1000 = 0.5 x $1000 = $500

Now, we'll add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment:
$1000 + $500 = $1500

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. Since the potatoes are roughly the same size, we can assume that the time to peel and cut each potato is constant.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut one potato is 5 seconds. To add these values, we need to convert the time to cut the potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we multiply the total time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"The art of calculating profit margins in a lemonade stand. As a connoisseur of all things black (my favorite color, of course), I'll break down the numbers for you.

Let's start with the revenue. Juan and Carlos sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. The revenue per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, let's denote the total cost of lemons and sugar per gallon as C. We know that the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5. Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up the equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - C = $25

To find the total cost, we can add $25 to both sides of the equation:
$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:
$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

The final answer is: $35"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and the number of Japanese participants is 80. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asians.

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since the number of Chinese boys is given as 60, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls is 100."
"To calculate Zaid's remaining income after all expenses and donations, we need to break down his monthly expenses.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500.

He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

"To calculate the total number of crabs, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R. We are given that B = 40, M = B - 4, and R = M + 10.

We can express M in terms of B: M = 40 - 4 = 36.

Then, we can express R in terms of B: R = 36 + 10 = 46.

Now, we can add up the number of crabs each person has: B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"As a math tutor, I can help you calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks.

To find the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to calculate the earnings for each week and add them together. 

For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 5 hours = $50.
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

Total earnings for the first two weeks = $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the loser got the remaining 1/4 of the votes.

Number of votes the loser got = (1/4) * 80
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can express this as:

Number of red roses = 4 * Number of white carnations

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of red roses:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. To find Mark's age two years ago, we need to calculate half of Jan's age at that time.

Half of Jan's age two years ago = 30 / 2 = 15

Since Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago, we add 5 to 15 to find Mark's age two years ago.

Mark's age two years ago = 15 + 5 = 20

To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago.

Mark's current age = 20 + 2 = 22

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 to Mark's current age to find Jean's age.

Jean's age = 22 + 2 = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"In the context of track and field, a 4x400 meter relay is a classic event that requires a combination of speed, endurance, and strategy. As someone who appreciates the nuances of athletic performance, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's analyze the times for each runner on the less well-rounded team. The first runner's time is 60 seconds, followed by 57 seconds, 54 seconds, and 51 seconds for the subsequent runners. To find the total time, we can calculate the sum of these individual times:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds

Now, let's compare this to the well-rounded team's time, which is 55 seconds per runner. Since there are four runners, their total time is:

55 * 4 = 220 seconds

The difference in time between the two teams is:

222 - 220 = 2 seconds

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"When analyzing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we can approach the problem from a combinatorial perspective.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is equivalent to the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6, which is 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. This can be expressed as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 3/6 = 1/2

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (which is 3/6) and then the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 3/6), given that the first roll was even. This can be expressed as:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

P(difference) = P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(difference) = (1/4) * 100% = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"To determine the total number of apples picked, we can use simple arithmetic. Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. This can be represented as:

Number of apples picked by Jenna = (1/2) × Number of apples picked by mom
= (1/2) × 20
= 10

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked by Jenna + Number of apples picked by mom
= 10 + 20
= 30

Therefore, the total number of apples picked is 30."
"As a rodent behaviorist, I've studied the distribution patterns of rodents in various environments. In this scenario, we're dealing with a pet store where rodents are being distributed straw. To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to analyze the given information.

Let's break down the problem:

- The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits with 20 pieces of straw.

First, we calculate the total straw used for the hamsters and rabbits:

Total straw used for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50
Total straw used for rabbits = 20

The total straw used for the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160. So, the straw used for rats is:

Total straw used for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90

Since the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3 to find the number of straw pieces per cage:

Straw pieces per cage = 90 / 3 = 30

Now, we know each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find the number of rats in each cage, we can divide the straw pieces per cage by 6:

Number of rats in each cage = 30 / 6 = 5

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can use the formula for simple interest: I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time in years.

In this case, the principal (P) is $100, the rate (r) is 2% or 0.02, and the time (t) is 3 months, which is 0.25 years.

I = P * r * t
I = $100 * 0.02 * 0.25
I = $5

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict.
Amount to be paid = P + I
Amount to be paid = $100 + $5
Amount to be paid = $105

The final answer is: $105"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 30x.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation: 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: 400 = 30x - 22x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 400 = 8x.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8: x = 400 / 8.

x = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost of the expenses, we need to calculate the cost of the food and the rides separately and then add them to the cost of the tickets.

The cost of the tickets is given as $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and there are 2 rides. 

Cost of rides = 2 * $33
Cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can use the formula:

Total peaches = Number of hours * Number of peaches per hour

Given that John collects peaches for 3 hours and can collect 2 peaches per minute, we first need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute:

Total peaches = 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute
Total peaches = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"As an ornithologist specializing in waterfowl behavior and nutrition, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the daily insect requirement for a flock of ducks.

To calculate the daily insect requirement, we need to divide the total weekly requirement by 7. 

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks would need 0.5 pounds of insects per day to meet their nutritional needs.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over the 10-year period.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, resulting in a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees. However, he also chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Initially, Tom had 50 trees. Adding the net gain to the initial number of trees, we get:

50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3:

130 * 0.3 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

130 - 39 = 91 trees

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the number of pink plastic flamingos, we need to calculate the number of flamingos that were left after the neighbors took one third of them back on Saturday.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we need to subtract the cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

Violetta will get $10 in change.

The final answer is $10."
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we need to calculate the cost of one pen first. 

A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we can find the cost of 8 pens. 
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can use simple division. 

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds. To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can divide the total amount of carrots available by the number of restaurants and subtract the result from the total amount of carrots available.

200 pounds ÷ 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

200 pounds - (40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant) = 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can use the principle of set theory. The total population is the sum of the number of men, women, and children. Since we know the number of men and women, we can subtract their sum from the total population to find the number of children.

Let's denote the total population as P, the number of men as M, the number of women as W, and the number of children as C. We have:

P = M + W + C
23786 = 8417 + 9092 + C

To find C, we can rearrange the equation:

C = P - M - W
C = 23786 - 8417 - 9092
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, there are 6277 children in Soda."
"To calculate the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down her card collection by month.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month: 
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"As a seasoned copy-editor, I can break down the problem into manageable parts. Let's start by identifying the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Total sentences = 1000
Sentences per publisher = Total sentences / 2
Sentences per publisher = 1000 / 2
Sentences per publisher = 500

Now, we know that Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. To find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

Amount from Publisher A = Sentences per publisher * Rate per sentence
Amount from Publisher A = 500 * 5 cents
Amount from Publisher A = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

Amount from Publisher B = Amount from Publisher A * 2
Amount from Publisher B = 2500 * 2
Amount from Publisher B = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

Total amount = Amount from Publisher A + Amount from Publisher B
Total amount = 2500 + 5000
Total amount = 7500 cents

The final answer is: 7500"
"As a water resource management expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Baldur's water intake.

To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to consider the amount of water he receives in the morning and the afternoon. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate the total water intake as follows:

Morning water intake: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon water intake: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total water intake per day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets a total of 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: 55"
"To calculate John's total earnings for the year, we need to consider the monetary reward and the 5% raise in salary.

First, let's calculate his earnings before the award:
He makes $2000 per week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, his total earnings before the award would be:
$2000 * 52 = $104,000

The award amount is $5,000, which is a one-time monetary reward. To calculate the total earnings, we simply add the award amount to his pre-award earnings:
$104,000 + $5,000 = $109,000

The final answer is: $109,000"
"As a viticulturist specializing in grape cultivation, I can provide a precise calculation for the number of barrels of wine produced on Josie's farm.

To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre and then by the barrels of wine produced per ton.

Let's break it down:

Number of acres: 10
Grapes per acre: 5 tons
Wine per ton: 2 barrels

Total tons of grapes: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
Total barrels of wine: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

"To calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of pens in the blue bags:
6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens

Next, let's calculate the number of pens in the red bags:
2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens

Now, let's add the number of pens of each color:
22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens = 98 pens

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we need to consider the average of the six tests. Since she can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then determine the required score for the sixth test.

Let's denote the sum of the first five test scores as S. We know the scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. 

S = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86
S = 438

Since Brinley can remove the lowest score, which is 71, we subtract it from the total score: 
S - 71 = 438 - 71
S - 71 = 367

Now, we need to find the total score for six tests, which is the desired average multiplied by 6. The desired average is 93, so the total score is:
93 * 6 = 558

To find the required score for the sixth test, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score:
558 - 367 = 191

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 191 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 191."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to consider the two distinct periods of his cycling activity.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. This can be calculated as 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is the sum of the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to consider the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of cakes she bought on Monday as M, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday as T, and the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday as W.

We know that M = 4 (given).

We also know that T = 3M, and W = 5T.

Substituting the value of M into the equation for T, we get T = 3(4) = 12.

Substituting the value of T into the equation for W, we get W = 5(12) = 60.

Now, we can calculate the total number of cakes by adding M, T, and W: Total = M + T + W = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To calculate the cost of each cup, we can start by finding the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as x.

The total amount Sara needs to earn is $50 (jacket and shoes) - $10 (initial savings) = $40.

Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up the equation: 4x = 40.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 40 / 4.

x = 10

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's dive into the world of poultry farming. As someone who appreciates the sleek and sophisticated color black, I'll focus on cracking the problem.

We're given that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected is 42. Additionally, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and white chickens (w). We know that w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs can be represented as:

3r + 5w = 42

Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. We know that the number of customers on the second day is 50 more than the first day, so it can be represented as x + 50. The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50), and we are given that this sum equals 250.

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150). To find the number of customers on the third day, we add the total number of customers on the first two days to the given total for the third day:

Total customers on the first two days = 100 + 150 = 250
Total customers on the third day = 500

Since the total number of customers on the third day is given as 500, we can directly conclude that the number of customers on the third day is 500.

The final answer is 500."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons and the initial amount of water in the big pool as 2x gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute, the amount of water in both pools has decreased by 4 gallons/minute for the past 4 minutes. So, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y, where y is the current amount of water in the small pool.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Rearranging the second equation, we get x = y + 16.

Substituting x = y + 16 into the first equation, we get 2(y + 16) - 16 = 4y. Simplifying, we get 2y + 32 - 16 = 4y. Combining like terms, we get 2y + 16 = 4y. Subtracting 2y from both sides, we get 16 = 2y. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 8.

Now that we know y, we can find x by substituting y into the equation x = y + 16: x = 8 + 16, so x = 24.

The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she borrowed and the total amount she will pay.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is calculated as 10% of $2000, which is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay as $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"In the context of flower arrangements, the total number of flowers in the vase can be determined by adding the number of roses and dahlias.

Let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of dahlias as D. We are given that R = 4 and D = R + 7.

To find the total number of flowers, we can use the formula: Total = R + D.

Substituting the given values, we get: Total = 4 + (4 + 7) = 4 + 11 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote Harriet's current age as H, Zack's current age as Z, and Adrian's current age as A. We are given that H = 21 and H = Z/2. Therefore, we can find Z by multiplying H by 2: Z = 2H = 2(21) = 42.

Since A is three times the age of H, A = 3H = 3(21) = 63.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: H + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: Z + 3 = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: A + 3 = 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (H + Z + A + 6) / 3, since we are adding 3 years to each of their current ages. This can be simplified to (21 + 42 + 63 + 6) / 3.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, Brianna's points as B, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Y = (1/2)N + 10
Y = (1/2)(68) + 10
Y = 34 + 10
Y = 44

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
B = N + 17
B = 68 + 17
B = 85

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85
= 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.
J = 251 - (N + Y + B)
J = 251 - 197
J = 54

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles, we can use the following formula:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, the water tank contains 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

The collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left in the tank, which is 2 * 30 = 60 liters.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water and the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

The final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to calculate the number of petunias first. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"

"To determine the total number of days for the round trip, we need to calculate the number of days for each leg of the trip.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour

Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we need to calculate the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn's initial harvest and then find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

Initially, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

The remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Now, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

"To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the vehicles, taxes, and registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1,000 per car, so for 12 cars, it would be 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, taxes, and registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can express this as an equation: K = R + 5, where K represents the number of shells Kylie collects and R represents the number of shells Robert collects. Substituting the given value, we get K = 20 + 5 = 25.

Next, we are told that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. This can be expressed as K_Tuesday = 2 * K, where K_Tuesday represents the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. Substituting the value of K, we get K_Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices needed by 8 to find the number of pizzas:

Number of pizzas = Total number of slices needed / Slices per pizza
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ram starts with 25 pens and can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens. To find out how many full pens he can make, we can divide the total number of pens by 5.

25 pens ÷ 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is 30."

Let's denote Jessa's age as J, Joan's age as J + 5, and Mary's age as (J + 5) - 2.

Given that Jessa is 20 years old, we can substitute J = 20 into the expressions for Joan's and Mary's ages:

Joan's age = (20 + 5) = 25
Mary's age = (20 + 5) - 2 = 23

Now, let's find the sum of their ages:
J + (J + 5) + ((J + 5) - 2) = 20 + 25 + 23

Simplifying the expression:
20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. This can be calculated as 30% of the total number of students, which is 1000.

Number of students who went out through exit A = 0.3 * 1000 = 300

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700

Then, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is 3/5 of the remaining students.

Number of students who went out through exit B = (3/5) * 700 = 420

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.

Number of students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of candies each person has.

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as N. We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can write an equation:

N = 2R

We are also given that John has 54 candies, so we can substitute 54 for N:

54 = 2R

To solve for R, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

R = 54 ÷ 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' total by adding 6:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

Finally, we can find the difference between John's and James' candies:

Difference = N - J
= 54 - 33
= 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: 21"
"In the context of combinatorics, when two individuals read each other's books in addition to their own, the total number of books read can be calculated using the formula for combinations.

Let's denote the number of books Dolly has as 'D' and the number of books Pandora has as 'P'. The total number of books they will collectively read can be represented as:

D + P + (D-1) + (P-1)

This formula accounts for each person reading their own books and the other person's books.

Given that Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book, we can substitute these values into the formula:

2 + 1 + (2-1) + (1-1) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 4 books.

"To calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to consider the number of pages he writes and his writing speed.

Since Mike writes 30 pages per week and can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing as follows:

Time = Total pages * Time per page
Time = 30 pages * 6 minutes/page
Time = 180 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time (hours) = 180 minutes / 60
Time (hours) = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing per week.

"Let's break down Jason's phone plan usage to determine the remaining minutes.

Jason's phone plan has 1000 minutes per month. He has a 15-minute daily call with his boss, which occurs 30 times in a month. This results in a total of:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

Additionally, Jason has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. To find the total minutes used, we add these two amounts:

450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (for other people) = 750 minutes

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. This left Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"The problem at hand involves determining the number of fish in two aquariums, given the difference in the number of snails between the two tanks and the relationship between the snail difference and the fish population.

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. This can be expressed as:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"As a makeup artist specializing in film and television productions, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.

To calculate the total amount paid, we need to consider the total hours worked and apply the discount. 

First, let's calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost without discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $30,000: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

"To determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total calories from each of their cookie consumption.

Sue's cookies on Monday = 4 * 5 = 20 cookies
Sue's cookies on Tuesday = 2 * 13 = 26 cookies
Total cookies eaten by Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies
Total cookies eaten by her sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, we can calculate the total calories consumed by each:

Calories consumed by Sue = 46 * 200 = 9200 calories
Calories consumed by her sister = 18 * 200 = 3600 calories

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we can break down the information into two parts: wolves and cougars.

Let's denote the number of wolves killed last night as W and the number of cougars killed last night as C. We know that W = 10 and C = 15.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so the number of wolves killed today is 3C = 3(15) = 45.

Additionally, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so the number of cougars killed today is C - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed:

Total wolves = W + 45 = 10 + 45 = 55
Total cougars = C + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of the total wolves and cougars: 55 + 27 = 82.

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each initially. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. To find the number of cows in each stall after the division, we can calculate the total number of cows in all 20 stalls and then divide by 20.

The total number of cows in all 20 stalls initially is:
10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows

After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes:
200 cows + 40 cows = 240 cows

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall:
240 cows / 20 stalls = 12 cows/stall

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8:
12 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 96 cows

To find the total amount, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add it to the value of the dollar bills.

- 100 pennies = 100 x $0.01 = $1
- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank."
"To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we need to first determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate this as follows:

Weight of wood eaten by termites = Total weight of redwood * 0.30
Weight of wood eaten by termites = 8000 pounds * 0.30
Weight of wood eaten by termites = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight of redwood - Weight of wood eaten by termites
Weight of remaining wood = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
Weight of remaining wood = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue, we get: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation to represent the number of apples Jamal has:

Let x be the number of apples Jamal has.
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Andrea has x + 8 apples.
We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation: x + 8 = 52.

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
x = 52 - 8
x = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can set up an equation to represent the number of bananas Jamal has:

Let y be the number of bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so y = x + 4.
We know x = 44, so we can substitute this value into the equation: y = 44 + 4.
y = 48

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
y / 2 = 48 / 2
y / 2 = 24

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits
Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits

Total number of fruits: 76 + 92 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we must first calculate the total number of cookies she is making. Since 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies, we can set up a proportion to find the total amount of flour needed.

Let x be the total number of cups of flour Carla needs. Since 2 cups are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:

2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 66 cookies

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2 * 66 = 12x
132 = 12x

Now, divide both sides by 12:

x = 132 / 12
x = 11

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

Final Answer: The final answer is 11."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following calculation:

(2/3) * 9300 = 6200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

Final Answer: The final answer is $62."
"To calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can use the formula for multiplication and addition.

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H.

We know that C = 6 (Chris has 6 trees).

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so H = 2F + 5 = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3 = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three variables: Carmen's money (C), Samantha's money (S), and Daisy's money (D). We know that:

C = 100
S = C + 25
D = S + 50

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for D:
D = (C + 25) + 50
D = C + 75

Now, we can add up the amounts:
C + S + D = 100 + (100 + 25) + (100 + 75)
= 100 + 125 + 175
= 400

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the additional fees associated with the purchase. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Adding this to the selling price gives us a total price of $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"As a financial analyst specializing in real estate transactions, I can break down the costs associated with selling a house. To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we need to consider the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

Transfer fees: 3% of the selling price = 0.03 x $400,000 = $12,000
Brokerage fee: 5% of the selling price = 0.05 x $400,000 = $20,000
Total amount paid: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000
Remaining loan amount: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds, we subtract the total amount paid from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000.

The final answer is: $368,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

The time to heat up the oil is given as 20 minutes. To heat up the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

The time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. 
Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes

"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by finding the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information provided.

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Next, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24.

We then find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 * 24 = 15.

Finally, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. 

Let's denote Mico's current age as x and Marco's current age as y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. We can represent this as an equation: R = 6S, where R is Ruby's current age and S is Sam's current age.

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9).

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"The problem at hand involves determining the total number of spots on cobras and mambas in a snake park, and then finding half of that total. As a herpetologist specializing in reptile behavior and ecology, I can provide a precise calculation.

First, we need to find the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Let's denote the number of cobras as C and the number of mambas as M. We are given that C = 40 and M = 60. The total number of spots can be calculated as:

Total Spots = (C * 70) + (M * 35)
Total Spots = (40 * 70) + (60 * 35)
Total Spots = 2800 + 2100
Total Spots = 4900

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total by 2:

Half the Total Spots = Total Spots / 2
Half the Total Spots = 4900 / 2
Half the Total Spots = 2450

Therefore, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2450}$"
"To calculate the total cost of pizzas for Maddy's cousin's soccer game, we need to determine the total number of people attending the event.

First, we calculate the number of team members and coaches: 12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 individuals.

Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is 12 * 2 = 24.

The total number of people is 15 (team members and coaches) + 24 (guests) = 39.

Since each pizza serves 3 people, we need to divide the total number of people by 3 to determine the number of pizzas required: 39 ÷ 3 = 13.

The cost of each pizza is $15, so the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

The final answer is: $195"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches, and the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches, so the space between the gemstones is 25 - 8 = 17 inches.

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches / (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we can start by finding the total number of stars. 

There are 3 rows of 8 stars, so 3 * 8 = 24 stars. 
There are 2 rows of 6 stars, so 2 * 6 = 12 stars. 
The total number of stars is 24 + 12 = 36 stars.

Since the flag has 76 stars, the number of 5-star rows is 76 - 36 = 40 stars.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we must consider the weight capacity of each truck and the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find the number of trucks required, we can divide the total weight of the flagstones by the truck's capacity.

Let's calculate the number of trucks needed:

Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds

Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Truck capacity
= 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
= 3 trucks

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, the speed of the car in the slow lane is 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"As a counter expert, I can analyze the problem and provide a solution.

Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

The total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 22 + 17 = 39.

Since the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together, we can set up the equation: 10x = 39, where x is the total number of medals given out.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10.

x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available and then divide them equally among the children.

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, resulting in a total of 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

The adults will receive 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars. To find the remaining chocolate bars, we subtract the number given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we divide the remaining 16 chocolate bars among the 8 children. This can be calculated as 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works and then divide that by 10 to find out how many $5 increments she earns.

Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours, we can calculate the total minutes she works as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many $5 increments she earns:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/increment = 15 increments

Since she earns $5 per increment, we can multiply the number of increments by the earnings per increment:

15 increments * $5/increment = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is $75."
"To determine the total points of the three players after the extra points are distributed, we need to calculate their points after the fourth round.

- Jim's points: 21 - 3 = 18
- Tony's points: 21 * 2 = 42

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony get an extra point each, and Jim does not get an extra point.

- Mike's points: 21 + 1 = 22
- Jim's points: 18
- Tony's points: 42 + 1 = 43

Now, we add up the points of all three players to find the total points:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates sold and subtract it from the target.

Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. To find the total number of crates sold, we can add these values:

20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can subtract the total number of crates sold from the target to find the difference:

120 - 65 = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the final cost of the desk, we can analyze the bidding process step by step. 

The initial bid was $200. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, we can express this as an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $50. The sequence of bids is: $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, and $450.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $300, $350, and $400. To find the total cost, we need to sum the bids she made and the bids made by the other 3 people.

The sum of the bids made by the other 3 people is $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 + $400 = $1200.

Carmen's total cost is $200 + $300 + $350 + $400 = $1250.

The final answer is $1250."
"As a transportation expert, I can break down the problem into its components to calculate the total cost of driving for John.

To determine the total distance driven per year, we need to calculate the total miles driven in a year. Since John's work is 30 miles away and he goes there and back each day, the total distance driven per day is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles. 

Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven per week is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week. 
Since there are 50 weeks in a year, the total miles driven per year is 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of driving. 
The cost of driving is $2 per mile, so the total cost of driving is 15000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30000.

Additionally, John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

The total cost of driving per year is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

The final answer is: $31800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference between his desired exercise time and the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Desired exercise time = 2 x (Monday's exercise time + Sunday's exercise time)
= 2 x (16 + 23)
= 2 x 39
= 78 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for 78 minutes, we can calculate the additional time he needs to exercise on Tuesday.

Additional time needed = Desired exercise time - Combined exercise time
= 78 - 39
= 39 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the pattern of page placement. 

When folding the paper, we have two sides: left and right. The left side has 16 pages (pages 1-16), and the right side has 16 pages (pages 17-32). 

Since each side has 16 pages, and we have two sides, we need 2 pieces of paper to make one side of the tabloid. 

Therefore, to make a 32-page tabloid, we need 2 pieces of paper for the left side and 2 pieces of paper for the right side, making a total of 4 pieces of paper.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the amount of money Annika has left, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the initial amount she brought.

Annika initially brought $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $50 / 2 = $25. Additionally, she spent $10 on rides.

Total money spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, let's subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:
$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can use the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. This means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since we know the number of books sold in the first year (90) and the total number of books sold in the first two years (200), we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the number of books sold in the first year from the total number of books sold in the first two years: 200 - 90 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold in the second year (110) by the price of each book (20$: 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"As a financial analyst specializing in hourly wage calculations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Watson's earnings for April.

To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we need to consider his daily earnings and the weekly bonus. Since Watson works 10 hours a day, five days a week, his daily earnings are:

10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate 20 x 0.2 (since 80% is equivalent to 0.8).

20 x 0.2 = 4

John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Next, we find the number of loaves left after the morning sales:
60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2:
(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

The loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so we divide the result by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 loaves

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to analyze the rate at which Joey loses weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find the rate at which Joey loses weight per week, we can divide the total weight lost by the number of weeks:

Weight lost per week = Total weight lost / Number of weeks
Weight lost per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost per week = 2 pounds/week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Weight lost per week (Sandy) / Number of weeks (Sandy) = Weight lost per week (Joey) / Number of weeks (Joey)
2 pounds/week / x weeks = 2 pounds/week / 4 weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 2 * 4
2x = 8
x = 8 / 2
x = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

"The Lots-of-Limbs Serum: A Mathematical Analysis

As a biomechanical engineer specializing in prosthetics and limb growth, I'll break down the calculation to determine the total number of new limbs a person will grow after administering the serum.

The serum causes the person to grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. To find the total number of new limbs, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic.

Let's calculate the number of complete cycles of 3 and 5 days within 15 days:

- Complete cycles of 3 days: 15 / 3 = 5
- Complete cycles of 5 days: 15 / 5 = 3

Since the person grows an extra arm every 3 days, they will grow 5 extra arms in 5 complete cycles. However, there will be 0 remaining days for an additional arm.

Similarly, since the person grows an extra leg every 5 days, they will grow 3 extra legs in 3 complete cycles. However, there will be 0 remaining days for an additional leg.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of items purchased so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to consider the daily egg consumption of the family members.

There are 5 family members in total. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, while the remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day. 

Let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day:
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
- 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can use the given information:

Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. We can express this as an equation: Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3. Substituting Quinn's age, we get Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can express this as another equation: Trent's age = Jane's age + 5. Substituting Jane's age, we get Trent's age = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

Let's denote Noah's current age as N and the current population of Chile as P. We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46 years old. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we can set up the equation:

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
3000 * 40 = P - 6 (since the population six years ago was half of the current population)

Now, we can solve for P:

3000 * 40 = P - 6
120,000 = P - 6
P = 120,000 + 6
P = 120,006

The current population of Chile is 120,006.

The final answer is: 120,006"
"In the context of football team roster management, it's essential to understand the relationships between the different units. Given that the team has 105 members, we can establish the following equations based on the problem statement:

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

Final Answer: The final answer is 30."
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to consider the total number of people invited and the number of people who couldn't attend due to illness and previous commitments.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people. To find the total number of people who couldn't attend, we add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments: 8 + 2 = 10.

Now, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of people invited: 24 - 10 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"As a marble expert, I can provide a precise calculation for the total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store.

To find the total weight, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 
   Solomon bought 20 marbles and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 
   2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. 
   So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. 
   Total marbles = 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

2. Now, add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. 
   Total marbles = 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

3. Since each marble weighs 2kgs, multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. 
   Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the dimensions of the pool: Length = 6 feet, Width = 4 feet, and Depth = 5 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool would be:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can use the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Since there are 30 boys, the number of girls can be calculated as 3 times 30, which is 90.

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. To find the number of nongendered children, we multiply the number of boys by 1/10, which is 30 * 1/10 = 3.

Now, we can add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children to find the total number of children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there were initially 25 men and 15 women at the party. The total number of people at the party is the sum of men and women, which is 40.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows:

Number of people who left = 1/4 * 40 = 10

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. To find the number of men who left, we subtract the number of men who stayed from the initial number of men:

Number of men who left = 25 - 22 = 3

Now, we know that 3 men and 10 people in total left the party. Since we know that 3 men left, the number of women who left is:

Number of women who left = 10 - 3 = 7

To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women:

Number of women left = 15 - 7 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic relationship between the costs of three items: a magazine, a book, and a pen.

"To determine the total number of boxes needed, we need to calculate the total number of pencils first. We know Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. Additionally, Meg has 46 pencils.

Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as 'x'. Since Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, the total number of pencils in the boxes is 3x. Adding the 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is 3x + 2.

We are also given that the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is 120. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 + 46 = 120

Combine like terms:

3x + 48 = 120

Subtract 48 from both sides:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can now determine the total number of boxes needed. Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils, and Meg has 46 pencils, which is equivalent to 1 box full of pencils (assuming each box can hold 24 pencils). Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is:

3 (Jam's boxes) + 1 (Meg's box) = 4

The total number of boxes needed is 4.

"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the cooling effect and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Let's dive into the world of record trading. As a vinyl enthusiast and a keen observer of the music industry, I can tell you that the key to solving this problem lies in understanding the ratio of old records to new ones.

We know that 5 people traded their old records for 7 new ones. Since the ratio of old records to new records is 2:1, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

2x = 7

where x is the number of old records each person brought in.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 7 ÷ 2
x = 3.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can assume that each person brought in 3 old records, as the problem doesn't specify otherwise.

Now, we can multiply the number of people by the number of old records each person brought in:

5 people * 3 old records/person = 15 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 15 old records.

Final Answer: The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller components.

First, we know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, resulting in a total of (x + 5) - 7 + 8 people on the bus.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. Since the number of people on the bus after the second stop is equal to the number of people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 8 = 20

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events:

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that affect the number of lollipops he has.

First, he eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops out to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 more lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

"To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards they received and the discount applied.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip."
"As a financial analyst specializing in tax planning and compensation, I've broken down the calculations for both job options to determine the net pay for each.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:

- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100. However, since we are looking for the cost difference, we can express this as a positive value by taking the absolute difference: |$3,350 - $3,450| = $100.

The final answer is $100."
"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and divide it by 4.

The total number of guns is the sum of the guns each person has: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

Now, divide the total number of guns by 4:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can multiply the number of batches of suckers by the amount of sugar required per batch and add the amount of sugar needed for the batch of fudge.

The amount of sugar needed for suckers is 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.
The amount of sugar needed for fudge is 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we can use the following steps:

Initial value of each share: $8
Increase in the first year: 50%
Value after the first year: $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12
Decrease in the second year: 25%
Value after the second year: $12 - (25% of $12) = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:
8 shares * $9 per share = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L, the number Thomas ate as T, and the number John ate as J.

We know that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so L = 2.

We also know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so T = 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Finally, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so J = T/2 = 6/2 = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: J - L = 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows. We also know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's represent the number of cows as 'x'. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens can be represented as 2x.

The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, which is x + 2x = 3x. We are given that this total is equal to 60. So, we can set up the equation:

3x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 60/3
x = 20

Now that we know the number of cows (x = 20), we can find the number of chickens, which is 2x = 2(20) = 40.

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of animal and add them together. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:

(20 cows * 4 legs/cow) + (40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken)
= 80 + 80
= 160

Therefore, the total number of legs is 160.

The final answer is: 160"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we can calculate the total number of balls he had at the end of the fourth week and subtract the number he lost.

Josh started with 3 balls and added 1 ball each week. 

Week 1: 3 balls
Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

Since Josh dropped 3 balls, but 2 were caught, he lost 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we need to calculate the combined weight of the animals and add the weight of the container.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and it is equal in weight to the blue beetle. The green toad also weighs 50 pounds. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 20 (container) - 30 (red bird) = 200 pounds.

The final answer is: $oxed{200}$"

"As a sports analytics expert, I've analyzed Tyson's training regimen and calculated the total distance covered in June.

To determine the new daily distance, we need to calculate 1/5 of the original distance and add it to the original distance. 

1/5 of 5000 meters is 5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters. Adding this to the original distance, we get 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters per day.

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June is 6000 * 30 = 180,000 meters.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"As a color connoisseur, I can assure you that my expertise lies in the realm of the visual spectrum. However, when it comes to calculating the price difference between Juice Box A, B, and C, I can provide a straightforward solution.

Let's break it down step by step:

Juice Box A is priced at $4.

Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $5 = $9.

Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

Therefore, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total number of legs, we can use the formula: Total legs = (number of tables with 4 legs * 4) + (number of tables with 3 legs * 3).

Given that there are 40 tables with 4 legs and 50 tables with 3 legs, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Total legs = (40 * 4) + (50 * 3)
Total legs = 160 + 150
Total legs = 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is:
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to find the discount on one shirt and then multiply it by 2.

The discount on one shirt is 40% of $30, which can be calculated as:

Discount = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total cost of 2 shirts = $18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is: $36"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to calculate the difference in revenue between the tractor and silo production.

The factory originally produced 10 tractors per day at a revenue of $100 per tractor, resulting in a total revenue of $1000 per day. Now, they produce 5 silos per day at a revenue of $220 per silo, resulting in a total revenue of $1100 per day.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final Answer: The final answer is 10%."
"As a canine nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Madeline's dog expenses. To calculate the total yearly cost, we need to break down the monthly expenses.

First, we calculate the weekly cost of food: $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. 

Next, we add the monthly cost of treats, which is $20, and the monthly cost of medicine, which is $100. The total monthly cost is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $220 * 12 = $2,640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to consider the duration of each activity.

The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the cooking class on Tuesday is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, which is 3 hours. So, the museum tour on Thursday is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she requires twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can calculate the total number of pots needed as follows:

Number of pots for daisies = 30
Number of pots for roses = 2 * 30 = 60
Total number of pots needed = 30 + 60 = 90

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had:

100 - 90 = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can use a simple subtraction equation. 

Initial amount = $36
Amount spent on sweater = $11
Amount given to brother = $4

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate 40% of his total vacation time. 

First, we calculate the total time John spent on activities other than sightseeing: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we can calculate 40% of the total time to find the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate Annabelle's remaining savings, we need to determine her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours, resulting in earnings of 20 * $10 = $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, earning $5 * 15 = $75. 

Her total earnings are $200 + $75 = $275. Adding her initial savings of $80, we get $275 + $80 = $355.

To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45.

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can use the given information. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as S, the height of the second tree as S + 5, and the height of the tallest tree as T.

We know that S = 6 feet. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is S + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is S + (S + 5) = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so T = 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Dean has left, we need to consider the initial amount of money he had, the cost of the items he purchased, and the additional amount his mother gave him.

The initial amount of money Dean had was $28. The total cost of the toy cars is 6 * $2 = $12. The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

To find the amount of money Dean has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money: $28 - $17 = $11.

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so we add this amount to the remaining money: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5, and she wants to play once, so the total cost for mini-golf is $5. The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride, and she wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. Additionally, she wants to give each friend $5 in arcade tokens, so we need to add $5 * number of friends to the total cost.

Let's denote the number of friends as 'x'. The total cost of the activities is $5 + $20 + $5x. Since her budget is $90, we can set up the equation:

$5 + $20 + $5x = $90

Combine like terms:

$25 + $5x = $90

Subtract $25 from both sides:

$5x = $65

Divide both sides by $5:

x = $65 / $5

x = 13

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the calculation yields a whole number, so the answer is 13.

The final answer is 13."
"As a financial analyst specializing in budgeting and savings, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To determine how much Marisa saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

Therefore, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of gumballs is 40 * 0.05 = $2.

Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought: $2 / $1.5 = 1.33 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable S, which represents the son's age.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and divide it by the service interval.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city to the first city. The combined distance from the third city to the first city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

900 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.05

To convert 0.05 to a more meaningful unit, we can express it as a fraction: 1/20.

Therefore, the train goes between services for 1/20 of a day, which is equivalent to 3 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we need to calculate the amount required for each type of bed and then sum them up.

The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is the average of the stuffing needed for the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to break it down into three parts: the trip to his friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate the time taken for this part of the trip:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

The detour adds 10 miles to the trip, but since the speed remains the same, the time taken for the detour is:

Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours

The return trip is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for this part of the trip:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for each part of the trip to get the total time taken:

Total time taken = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 5.99 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5.99}$"
"To determine the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, we know the total number of students is 96, and the number of absent students is 9 (5 girls and 4 boys).

"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to consider the given information. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the number of boys as B and the number of girls as G. We know that B = 2G.

Given that there are 6 girls in the park, we can substitute G = 6 into the equation B = 2G to find the number of boys.

B = 2G
B = 2(6)
B = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls.

Total number of kids = B + G
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Jane has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, for a total of 33 points. To meet the requirement of at least 42 points, she needs to score enough points on the third test to reach or exceed 42.

Let's calculate the minimum points needed on the third test:

42 (required points) - 33 (points scored so far) = 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the overall total.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as x. We know that x = 3.

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4x - 5. Since x = 3, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is 4(3) - 5 = 7.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 3(7) = 21.

The total number of customers kicked out is the sum of these three groups: x + (4x - 5) + 21. We know this total is equal to 50.

Now, we can set up the equation: x + (4x - 5) + 21 = 50.

Combine like terms: 5x + 16 = 50.

Subtract 16 from both sides: 5x = 34.

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6.8.

However, since x represents the number of customers, it must be a whole number. We will round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a customer.

x = 6.

Now, we can find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the overall total.

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 6 - 7 - 21 = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's say Sara had x points before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for how many points Erin had before, not Sara. Since Erin scored 14 points after scoring 14 points, it means Erin had 0 points before.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost of senior gifts, we need to consider the costs associated with picture frames, pins, and cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching the logo. This can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24 per frame

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to calculate the cost of pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. The total cost for pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12. The total cost for cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

To find the total cost of senior gifts, we add the costs of picture frames, pins, and cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. The total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000.

The amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

So, the amount spent on functioning pieces is 400,000 - 0.4x.

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 400,000 - 0.4x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.4x = 400,000

1x = 400,000

x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Total amount spent on functioning pieces = 400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= 400,000 - 160,000

"To calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break it down into two parts: the milk from the first half of the sheep and the milk from the second half.

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from each of the 15 sheep in the first half, the total milk from this group is 15 * 1 = 15 kg.

Similarly, she gets 2 kg of milk from each of the 15 sheep in the second half, so the total milk from this group is 15 * 2 = 30 kg.

The total amount of milk Mary collects every day is the sum of the milk from both groups: 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is 45 kg."
"To determine the number of pieces of rolls Mrs. Sherman fed to the chickens, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of rolls remaining after feeding her 6 children. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we subtract 6 from 12.

12 - 6 = 6

Next, we multiply the remaining rolls by 8 to find the total number of pieces.

6 * 8 = 48

Therefore, Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.

Final answer: 48"
"To determine the number of pupils who like the color yellow, we can break down the information as follows:

First, we find the number of pupils who like blue: 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we find the number of pupils who like green: 20 (remaining pupils) / 4 = 5.

Finally, we find the number of pupils who like yellow: 20 (remaining pupils) - 5 (pupils who like green) = 15.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we can analyze the given information.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56. Since the price per apple is $4, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount received / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which is 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we can add the number of apples picked on each day:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we add the initial number of cookies Rachel had to the number of cookies Janet gave her: 23 + 42 = 65.

Therefore, there are 21 cookies left for Rachel.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 802.35

The final answer is: $802.35"
"To determine the distance each person hiked, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

For Cho, the distance hiked is:
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

For Chloe, the distance hiked is:
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 45 km

To find the difference in the distances hiked, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:
Difference = 112 km - 45 km
Difference = 67 km

The correct answer is: 67"
"To calculate the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to consider the amount of silver and gold they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

Final answer: 350"
"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to first determine the total number of cups of lemonade she can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she buys enough supplies for 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Her revenue is the total number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The cost is $18, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people performing, we need to calculate the total number of girls in the choir, which is 50% of 52, or 0.5 * 52 = 26. Since the choir is performing with just the female members, there are 26 girls.

However, half of the people performing can't make it to the show, so we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

The total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate Wilson's current math grade, we need to find the average of his 5 test scores. The average is calculated by adding up the scores and dividing by the number of tests.

Let's denote the sum of the scores as S. We know the scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. To find S, we add these scores together: S = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.

Next, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 5. The average is S/5 = 400/5 = 80.

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

80"
"To calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Erasers * Cost of One Eraser) + (Number of Pencils * Cost of One Pencil)

"To determine the amount David saves, we need to calculate the cost of buying 9 ride tickets and compare it to the cost of buying a ride bracelet.

The cost of 9 ride tickets is 9 tickets * $2 per ticket = $18.

The cost of a ride bracelet is $30.

Since David buys a ride bracelet, he doesn't need to buy any tickets. Therefore, he saves $30 - $18 = $12.

However, we can also consider the scenario from Dasha's perspective. If Dasha buys 9 ride tickets, the cost is $18. If she buys a ride bracelet, the cost is $30.

In this case, Dasha saves $30 - $18 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To determine the amount of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total amount of ribbon she has by the number of gifts she wants to make bows for.

Total gifts = 6 (for family) + 4 (for friends) + 2 (for teachers) = 12 gifts
Total ribbon = 144 inches

Ribbon per gift = Total ribbon / Total gifts
Ribbon per gift = 144 / 12
Ribbon per gift = 12 inches

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to consider the costs of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 
20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

The final answer is: $42"

"To determine the number of slices left, we need to calculate the total slices given away and subtract that from the initial number of slices.

Jenny gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices.
Jenny gave 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices.

In total, Jenny gave away 4 + 3 = 7 slices.

Jenny had 12 slices initially and gave away 7 slices, so she has 12 - 7 = 5 slices left.

Jenny also ate 2 slices, so she has 5 - 2 = 3 slices left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine the number of days Mark needs to save for the bike, we can use the following formula:

Number of days = (Cost of the bike - Initial amount) / Daily earnings

Given that Mark has $50 initially and earns $10 per day, we can plug in the values:

Number of days = ($300 - $50) / $10
Number of days = $250 / $10
Number of days = 25

Therefore, Mark needs 25 days to save for the bike.

"To calculate the total number of bugs, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we are told that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12 = 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs) = 168

Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy saw is 168."
"To determine the age difference between Alice and Erica, we can use the given information. Since Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as 30 + 5 = 35 years.

"As a construction expert, I can provide a precise calculation for the builder's annual earnings.

To determine the total number of working days in a year, we need to multiply the number of weeks worked per month by the number of weeks in a month and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the builder works 4 * 4 = 16 weeks per year.

Since there are 365 days in a year, and the builder works 6 days a week, the total number of working days in a year is 16 * 6 = 96 days.

Now, we can multiply the number of working days by the daily wage to find the total earnings:

96 days * $50 per day = $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we must consider the quantities required for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. To make a quadruple batch, we multiply these quantities by 4.

Flour: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups
Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of bags: 12 / 2 = 6 bags

Milk: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups
Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide 4 by 2 to get the number of bottles: 4 / 2 = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"As an energy efficiency expert, I can help you calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage of the air conditioner.

To find the energy saved, we need to first find the total energy used in 8 hours a day and then subtract the energy used in 3 hours a day.

Energy used in 8 hours a day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Energy used in 3 hours a day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

Since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) is equal to 1000 Wh, we can convert the energy saved per day to kilowatts:

Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Now, let's find the energy saved in 30 days:

Energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"

"To determine the total cost of the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

The total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final answer is: $50.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, we can represent the number of corns as 2 * 40 = 80.

However, it's given that he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. This implies that the number of corns is 40 less than the number of cannolis. So, the correct number of corns is 40 + 40 = 80.

Now, we can calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis. The total is 80 (corns) + 100 (cannolis) = 180.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This results in a total of:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 
1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. 
So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The final answer is: $42,000"

"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples from the average trees as z.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30. We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathers y = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3y = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + y + 3y = 3x + 4y. We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 4y + z = 500

We also know that Joanne gathers z apples from the average trees, and her sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees. Since the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 4y, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 4y).

Substituting x = 30 and y = 15 into the equation, we get:

3(30) + 4(15) + z = 500
90 + 60 + z = 500
150 + z = 500
z = 350

The final answer is: $\boxed{350}$"
"As a camel expert, I can provide a precise solution to this problem.

Let's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. We know that camels have two humps, while dromedaries have one hump. The total number of heads is 180, and the total number of bumps is 304.

We can set up the following system of equations:

2c + d = 304  (Equation 1)
c + d = 180  (Equation 2)

To solve for 'c', we can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we have found 'c', we can substitute it into Equation 2 to find 'd':

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: 56"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers."
" locker sizes are a fascinating topic in spatial geometry. As someone who appreciates the sleek, mysterious allure of black, I find myself drawn to the intricacies of locker dimensions.

To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we must first establish the size of Zack's locker. Given that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate Zack's locker size by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.

Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches = 20 cubic inches

Since Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker, we can calculate Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

The elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"As a financial analyst specializing in capital management, I can provide a straightforward calculation to determine Mr. Josue's current capital.

To find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks.

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

Final Answer: The final answer is $17000."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into three parts:

The first 6 months are charged at $8 per month, which is equivalent to 6 * $8 = $48. The next 8 months are charged at $12 per month, resulting in 8 * $12 = $96. The last 8 months are charged at $14 per month, giving us 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's represent the original price of the tattered jeans as x. Then, the original price of the jogger jeans is x - 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3) * (x + 6) = 6

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(2/3) * x + 4 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 12 = 18

Subtract 12 from both sides:

2x = 6

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 3

Now that we know the original price of the tattered jeans is $3, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:

Original price of jogger jeans = x - 6
= 3 - 6
= -3

However, since the price cannot be negative, we re-evaluate our initial assumption. Let's re-examine the problem.

If the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28, then the jogger jeans cost $28 - 6 = $22.

Since Cole saved a total of $6, and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

(2/3) * 22 = 6

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

44 = 18

This is a contradiction, as 44 is not equal to 18. However, we can re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the original statement: ""He saved a total of $6."" This implies that the total savings is $6, and the difference between the original prices of the two jeans is $6.

Since the tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 - 6 = $22.

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $28 - $22 = $6.

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total capacity of the vehicles, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"As an ornithologist specializing in bird behavior and ecology, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Lillian's garden has a total of 6 bird feeders, consisting of 3 store-bought and 3 homemade feeders. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, while the homemade feeders attract 30 birds each, as they have a higher attractiveness due to the unique design and materials used.

To calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

Let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders: 3 feeders x 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders: 3 feeders x 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds.

The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is the sum of the birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost as $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. 

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
$4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x.

Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $50. Each card is sold for $1.5. We can set up the equation:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can multiply the fractions and simplify:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50
(2 * $1.5) / 3 * x = $50
$3 / 3 * x = $50
$1 * x = $50

Now, divide both sides by $1:

x = $50 / $1
x = 50

So, Kenny started with 50 cards."
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can use the concept of total demand and supply. The caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, which accounts for 36 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.

Let's calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests to have two hotdogs:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, there was a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

To find the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who received two hotdogs from the total number of guests:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

Therefore, 22 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To determine the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in each name separately.

Indras' name has 6 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and adding 4 to that gives us 7 letters in her sister's name.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"As a seasoned expert in retail mathematics, I can confidently calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order with ease.

To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

The final answer is: $132.00"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"The art of dragon slaying is a complex and nuanced field, and as a renowned expert in the realm of medieval warfare, I shall break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus, a skilled swordsman, slew 100 dragons with his mighty sword. This establishes a baseline for our calculations.

Next, we are informed that Prince Arthur, utilizing a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be represented mathematically as:

Prince Arthur's dragons = (3/4) * Prince Thaddeus's dragons
= (3/4) * 100
= 75 dragons

Now, we are told that Prince Walter, armed with a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This can be calculated as:

Prince Walter's dragons = 2 * Prince Arthur's dragons
= 2 * 75
= 150 dragons

Finally, we are informed that Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This can be represented as:

Prince Bruce's dragons = (1/5) * Prince Walter's dragons
= (1/5) * 150
= 30 dragons

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: 30"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we must first calculate 1/4 of the total amount of gas in gallons. 

Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15 / 5 = 3 gallons. 

Now, we can calculate 1/4 of 3 gallons: 

1/4 * 3 gallons = 3/4 gallon

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can convert 3/4 gallon to pints:

(3/4) * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by calculating the total amount of money George spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = $1.20.

George spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents. Since he had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

Now, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars: 495 - 120 = $3.75.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 3.75 ÷ 0.75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of lollipops each friend received, we can use the concept of division. Since Ray shared the remaining lollipops equally among 4 friends, we can divide the total number of remaining lollipops (20) by 4.

"To calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to consider the total cost of the ingredients and the number of servings.

The cost of the onions: 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00
The cost of the beef stock: 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00
The total cost of the ingredients: $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is: $12.00 / 6 = $2.00

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time difference between their travel times.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as B. We know that B = 4W (since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel).

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation: B = W - 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get: 4W = W - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3W = 5.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: W = 5/3.

Now that we know the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater: B = 4W = 4(5/3) = 20/3.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater from the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater: 5 - (20/3) = 5 - 20/3 = (15 - 20)/3 = -5/3.

Since we can't have a negative time, we can convert this to a more meaningful answer. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and then round it to the nearest whole number. 

Converting -5/3 to a decimal, we get -1.67. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get -2.

However, since we can't have a negative number of minutes, we can re-evaluate the problem. We can re-evaluate the equation B = W - 5 and solve for B in terms of W. 

B = W - 5

B = W - 5

B = 4W - 5

Now, we can substitute B = 4W into the equation W = 5/3.

W = 5/3

4W = 4(5/3)

4W = 20/3

B = 20/3 - 5

B = 20/3 - 15/3

B = 5/3

Now, we can find the time difference between their travel times.

B - W = 5/3 - 5/3

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes due to baking and cooling.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. When Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the temperature increase is:

Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

However, when Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The cooling rate is 0.2 degrees/minute, so the total cooling effect is:

Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, we subtract the cooling effect from the temperature after baking:

Final temperature = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' time for the run, we need to analyze the given information. 

First, we calculate James' time for the swim by finding 10% of Jon's swim time and subtracting it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we calculate James' bike time by adding 5 minutes to Jon's bike time. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up an equation to find James' run time. Let's denote James' run time as x. The total time for Jon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes, and the total time for James is 36 + 85 + x. The difference between their times is 10 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:
170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
-x = -39
x = 39

Therefore, James' run time is 39 minutes.

The final answer is 39."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, we know that Movie C was 1.25 hours, which is equivalent to 75 minutes. 

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we can calculate its length by adding 5 minutes to Movie C's length.

Movie B's length = Movie C's length + 5 minutes
Movie B's length = 75 minutes + 5 minutes
Movie B's length = 80 minutes

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide Movie B's length by 4.

Movie A's length = Movie B's length / 4
Movie A's length = 80 minutes / 4
Movie A's length = 20 minutes

"To calculate the total cost of the hay, we need to first determine the total amount of hay consumed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total amount of hay consumed is:

Hay consumption = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Hay consumption = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Hay consumption * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

Michael has 6 * $5 = $30

Change = Michael's money - Cost
Change = $30 - $24

Therefore, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

Final Answer: The final answer is 112."
"The problem can be solved by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of the popcorn as P and the cost of the soda as S. We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and the cost of the movie ticket is $12. The cost of the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. We also know that the soda costs $3.

Since we saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18. We can set up the equation:

12 + P + S = 18

We also know that the cost of the soda is $3, so we can substitute S = 3 into the equation:

12 + P + 3 = 18

Now, we can solve for P:

P = 18 - 12 - 3
P = 3

The regular price of the popcorn is $3.

The final answer is: $3"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to first find the new cost of filling 20 balloons. The original cost of filling 20 balloons was $900.

"The problem at hand involves determining the total number of cards in a set, given the number of red, green, and yellow cards. As a magicians' card expert, I'll break down the information and apply my knowledge to arrive at the solution.

We are told that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards. To find the number of green cards, we can calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We are also told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"
"To determine the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we need to calculate the number of tubes of blue paint and yellow paint he has.

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate the difference in their song capacities. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we can express this as:

Luri's songs = 3 * Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 * 20
Luri's songs = 60

Now, we need to find out how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player. We can do this by subtracting Luri's songs from the maximum capacity of the player:

Gabriel's remaining capacity = 100 - 60
Gabriel's remaining capacity = 40

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to find 2/5 of the total number of oranges picked and then multiply it by the amount he gave up for each orange.

Since 2/5 of 60 oranges is equivalent to (2/5) * 60, we can simplify this expression by first multiplying the numerator (2) by 60, then dividing the result by the denominator (5).

(2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Now, we multiply the result by the amount he gave up for each orange, which is $10.

24 * $10 = $240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

Final answer: $240"
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We are given that her shoes cost $80, so s = $80.

We are also given that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. This can be represented as h = 3s - 20.

Substituting the value of s into the equation, we get h = 3($80) - 20.

First, calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes: 3($80) = $240.

Then, subtract $20 from the result: $240 - 20 = $220.

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

Final answer: $220"
"To calculate the total hours James runs per week, we can use the formula:

Total hours = Total miles / Speed

Given:
Total miles = 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

"To determine the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his horses, we can calculate the total amount of oats required for five days.

Each horse consumes 10 pounds of oats per day (5 pounds per meal, twice a day). With 4 horses, the total daily consumption is 10 * 4 = 40 pounds.

For five days, the total amount of oats needed is 40 * 5 = 200 pounds.

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we can find the number of bags required by dividing the total amount needed by 50: 200 / 50 = 4.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats for his horses for five days.

Final answer: 4"

"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, we can assume the average height of the bottom layer is 64"". The total height of the bottom layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

"To solve this insect collection problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David's total is x/2. Lily found 7 more than David, so her total is x/2 + 7.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily's total = x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This implies that the number of cows in the zoo is 2 times the number of cows in the farm. We can represent this as:

Zoo cows = 2 * Farm cows
Zoo cows = 2 * 30
Zoo cows = 60

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. This implies that the number of sheep in the farm is half the number of sheep in the zoo. We can represent this as:

Farm sheep = Zoo sheep / 2
Farm sheep = 20 / 2
Farm sheep = 10

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo by adding the number of cows and sheep from both places:

Total animals = Farm cows + Zoo cows + Farm sheep + Zoo sheep
Total animals = 30 + 60 + 10 + 20
Total animals = 120

"To calculate the calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve this goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We can calculate the number of days as follows:

July has 31 days, so from July 1st to July 19th, there are 19 days. 
From December 31st to December 31st, there are 0 days. 
From January 1st to June 30th, there are 183 days. 
Therefore, the total number of days is 19 + 0 + 183 = 202 days.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a calorie deficit of 3500 calories per day for 202 days. 

To calculate the total calorie deficit, we multiply the number of calories burned per day by the number of days:

3500 calories/day * 202 days = 7,070,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

7,070,000 calories / 202 days ≈ 34,857 calories per day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 34,857 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds."

"To determine the time it takes Royce to shingle a house, we can use the given information. Let's denote the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as 'R' minutes. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. This can be expressed as:

Time taken by Royce = 2R + 40

We are also given that Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

2R + 40 = 120

To solve for R, we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

2R = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

R = 40

Now that we know the time it takes Rob to shingle a house, we can find the time it takes Royce:

Time taken by Royce = 2R + 40

The bakery started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold. However, 6 loaves were returned, so the final number of loaves left is 200 - 132 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the bakery had 74 loaves of bread left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To determine the total number of rows, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips separately and then add them together.

For the red tulips, we can fit 6 tulips in a row. Since Jackson has 36 red tulips, we can divide 36 by 6 to find the number of rows: 36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows.

For the blue tulips, we can fit 8 tulips in a row. Since Jackson has 24 blue tulips, we can divide 24 by 8 to find the number of rows: 24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows.

To find the total number of rows, we add the number of rows for red and blue tulips together: 6 (red rows) + 3 (blue rows) = 9 rows.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of raisins by the amount of raisins needed for one batch of oatmeal cookies.

Total raisins = 27 cups
Raisins per batch of oatmeal cookies = 3/4 cup

Number of batches = Total raisins / Raisins per batch
= 27 / (3/4)

= 36

Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To calculate the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill, we need to consider the impact of the new device on her energy consumption.

First, we calculate the original weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatt-hours. Given that a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, the original weekly bill is 84 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $126.

Next, we calculate the new weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour. Therefore, the new weekly consumption is 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatt-hours.

The new weekly bill is then 98 kilowatt-hours * $1.50 = $147.

The difference in Ada's weekly electric bill is $147 - $126 = $21.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can use the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time required to complete the task.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as 10 days. 

Now, we can use the formula: Time = (Total Work) / (Number of Workers)

In this case, the total work is 1 whole house, and the number of workers is 5. 

Time = 1 / 5 = 0.2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24 (the number of hours in a day):

Time = 0.2 days * 24 hours/day = 4.8 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 4.8 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: 4.8"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as 'x'. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2.

We are also given that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so the number of chairs Jenna has is 3x.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so we can set up the equation x - 2 = 20 to find the value of x. Solving for x, we get x = 22.

Now that we know Ophelia has 22 chairs, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has, which is 3x = 3 * 22 = 66.

The total number of sofas and chairs is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the total amount paid and the cost of the headphone set.

Let's subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount paid:

Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the headphone set = $44

Remaining amount = Total amount paid - Cost of the headphone set
= $48 - $44
= $4

Since the cost of one CD is $4, we can divide the remaining amount by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought:

Number of additional CDs = Remaining amount ÷ Cost of one CD
= $4 ÷ $4
= 1

Therefore, Tom could have bought 1 more CD if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

The correct answer is A."
"To calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out, we need to consider the hours he worked each week. 

Josh worked 4 hours per week for 5 weeks, which equals 4 * 5 = 20 hours. He also worked 5 hours in one week and 6 hours in another week. 

Total hours = 20 hours + 5 hours + 6 hours = 31 hours.

"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

The final answer is: $\boxed{122}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote James' current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can write an equation for his current age: J + 5 = 27.

Solving for J, we get: J = 27 - 5 = 22.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. We can write an equation for this: C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: C + 8 = 2(30) - 5 = 55.

Solving for C, we get: C = 55 - 8 = 47.

Now, we can find the age difference between James and his cousin: |J - C| = |22 - 47| = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can start by finding the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can start by finding the total number of seashells brought by the girls. Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. 

60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as N and the number of candies George had initially as G.

We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write an equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G = 3 + 5
G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Anne's age, we can follow the given information:

Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. This means Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age: 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and add them together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

To find out how many vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she wants to make: 72 - 54 = 18.

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the total amount you paid, we need to find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Now, add the tip to the original bill: 
$50 (bill) + $10 (tip) = $60

So, you ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. Let's denote the amount saved in the first half as x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount saved in the second half is 2x.

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

So Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month. 

Since the second half is twice as much, Elvis saves 2x = 2 * 375 = $750 in the second half of the month.

To find out how much Elvis has to save each day in the second half, we can divide the total savings for the second half by 15 (the number of days in the second half):

$750 ÷ 15 = $50

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Apples * Price per Apple) + (Number of Oranges * Price per Orange) + (Number of Peaches * Price per Peach)

Plugging in the values given in the problem:

Total Cost = (3 * $1.50) + (5 * $0.80) + (6 * $0.75)
Total Cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total Cost = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is:

Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

The final answer is $7.00."
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can use the following formula:

Earnings Difference = (Jairus' Earnings - Jenny's Earnings)

Given that Jairus earns $0.8 per task and Jenny earns $0.5 per task, we can plug in the values as follows:

Earnings Difference = ($0.8 x 20) - ($0.5 x 20)
= $16 - $10

Therefore, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's dive into the world of algebra to solve this problem. As someone who appreciates the elegance of a well-crafted equation, I'll guide you through the solution.

We're given that Jeff and Brad are dividing $100 between them, with Jeff receiving 4 times as much as Brad. Let's represent the amount Brad receives as x. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much, we can express Jeff's share as 4x.

The total amount of money is $100, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 100

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad receives $20, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff receives $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to consider the round-trip distance to and from work. 

Since Jeff walks to work and back each day, the total distance he covers in a day is twice the distance to work. 

Distance to work = 3 miles
Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Number of days worked per week = 5

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

Therefore, Jeff walks a total of 30 miles per week."

"The problem can be modeled as a geometric progression, where the first term (a) is 3 and the common ratio (r) is 3. The number of families notified in each round can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: Sn = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where n is the number of rounds.

For the fourth round, we need to find the number of families notified, which is S4. Plugging in the values, we get:

S4 = 3 * (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)
S4 = 3 * (1 - 81) / (-2)
S4 = 3 * (-80) / (-2)
S4 = 120

Therefore, the total number of families notified during the fourth round is 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use the concept of linear decline. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's break it down:

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."

"As a marketing expert, I can break down the commission calculation into two parts: the base commission and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

The base commission for sales up to $1000 is calculated as 30% of the sales amount, which is $1000. This can be expressed as 0.3 * $1000.

To calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000, we need to find the amount exceeding $1000, which is $1500 ($2500 - $1000). The additional commission is then 10% of this amount, which is 0.1 * $1500.

The total commission earned by Antonella can be found by adding the base commission and the additional commission.

Base commission = 0.3 * $1000 = $300
Additional commission = 0.1 * $1500 = $150
Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. So, we first find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 × 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 × 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we can break it down into two parts: the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We know that x + y = 14 (since there are 14 buttons with four holes). We also know that the total number of buttons is 21.

We can set up the equation: x + y = 21

We are given that 7 buttons have two holes, so x = 7.

Now, we can substitute x into the equation: 7 + y = 21

Solving for y, we get: y = 14

Now, we can find the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes: 7 x 2 = 14

"To find the average weight of the three friends, we can use the formula for average:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20
Susan's weight = 150 - 20
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's weight:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the pages read in the first week. Since Judy reads 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, the total minutes read in the first week is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

Given that Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can find the number of pages read in 105 minutes by dividing 105 by 1.5.

105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per page = 70 pages

Now, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week to find the total number of pages read in two weeks.

70 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 170 pages

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to find the value of Shiloh's nephew's current age.

Let S be Shiloh's current age and N be his nephew's current age. We know that S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be S + 7, and his nephew's age will be N + 7. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

"To calculate the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break it down into three separate amounts.

The tooth fairy initially left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 each, totaling $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were worth $1.00 each, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 per tooth for the last two teeth, totaling $1.00.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon: 
$5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"The art of soccer analytics. As a keen observer of the beautiful game, I've analyzed the scoring dynamics between Richie, Mark, and Anna. Given the information that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna, we can deduce the following:

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. Using the given information, we can set up the following equations:

Richie's goals = Mark's goals + 20
80 = M + 20

Solving for Mark's goals, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

Similarly, we can solve for Anna's goals:
Richie's goals = Anna's goals + 45
80 = A + 45

Solving for Anna's goals, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now, we can calculate the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To determine the difference in earnings between Mitchell and Liam, we can calculate Mitchell's total earnings by multiplying the number of lemonades he sold (21) by the price of each lemonade ($4).

Let's perform the calculation:

21 * 4 = 84

Now, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings to find the difference:

84 - 63 = 21

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend.

The final answer is: $21"
"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate his daily expenditure and the remaining amount.

Peter has $70 initially. He spends $5 each day from Sunday to Wednesday, so his total expenditure for these four days is:
$5 * 4 = $20

He has $70 - $20 = $50 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $50 left, so he can buy:
$50 / $2 = 25

Since he can't buy a fraction of a figure, he will buy 25 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
- 3 wooden action figures
- 25 plastic action figures

Total action figures = 3 + 25 = 28

The final answer is 28."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to consider the expenses incurred. 

The cost of spaying the kitten is $200. The cost of the vaccines is $20 per vaccine, and Leah has 3 vaccines, so the total cost of vaccines is 3 * $20 = $60. The cost of the broken vases is 4 vases * $12 each = $48.

The total cost can be calculated by adding these expenses: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

The final answer is: $308"
"As a horticulturist specializing in rose cultivation, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.

To find the total number of roses needed per month, we multiply the total roses ordered by each shop by the number of weeks in a month (4 weeks). 

Total roses per week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses
Total roses per month: 65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, we subtract the number of roses he grows from the total number of roses needed per month to find the shortage:
260 roses/month - 40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 - 160 = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To calculate the remaining amount in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P - (P * r * t)

Where:
A = final amount
P = principal (initial amount) = $3000
r = monthly withdrawal rate = $100
t = time (in months) = 24

First, we need to convert the monthly withdrawal rate to a decimal:
r = $100 / 12 = $8.33 per month

Now, we can plug in the values:
A = $3000 - ($3000 * $8.33 * 24)
A = $3000 - $19,952
A = -$19,952

Since the result is negative, it means that the withdrawal amount exceeds the initial amount. In this case, the account will be overdrawn.

The correct answer is: $0"
"As a financial analyst specializing in food truck operations, I've analyzed the given scenario to determine the net profit of the grilled cheese food truck.

To calculate the net profit, we need to consider the total revenue and total cost. The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of sandwiches sold by the price per sandwich.

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches sold * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

The total cost consists of the cost of bread and the cost of cheese and condiments. Since each loaf of bread makes 10 sandwiches, the cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf. The cost of cheese and condiments is $30.00 for every 10 sandwiches.

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"To determine the total number of muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to calculate the total number of crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 ÷ 8 = 24

Now, to find out how much money Kate can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has (5) to the number of cards his brother has. Since his brother has 3 fewer cards, we can represent this as:

Number of cards the boy has + (Number of cards the boy has - 3)

This can be simplified to:

5 + (5 - 3)

Using the order of operations, we first subtract 3 from 5:

5 - 3 = 2

Then, we add 5 to the result:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7.

"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

The correct answer is: 540.8"

First, we convert both times to minutes:
1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To calculate the combined value of the two houses, we need to find the value of Juan's house first. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate this by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

"To determine the total number of utensils, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

"As a contact lens expert, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the cost of each pair of contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. Since each box is currently 10% off, we'll calculate the discounted price of 1 box and then multiply it by 2.

Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
Total cost of 2 boxes = 2 x $90.00 = $180.00

Since 1 box contains 90 pairs of contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

Cost per pair = Total cost / Total pairs
= $180.00 / 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how much each person earned, we need to calculate their individual earnings.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.
Jill earns $10 per hour, so her total earnings are 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours.
John earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings are 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To calculate the total water Hannah needs to drink, we must first determine the total calories burned during her activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

Total calories burned = (500 calories/hour * 2 hours) + (600 calories/hour * 1 hour)
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"The art of jelly bean conundrums. As a connoisseur of all things black (my favorite color, of course), I shall apply my expertise to unravel the mystery of the Burger Palace jelly bean jar.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write an equation:

B + R + G = 4500

We also know that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:

R = 0.99B

Furthermore, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be written as:

G = 1.01B

Now, let's substitute the expressions for R and G into the first equation:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

3B = 4500

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 1500

Now that we have the value of B, we can find the value of R:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

And, finally, we can find the value of G:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change over 5 weeks.

Martin's weight loss per week when eating Cheerios is 1.25 pounds. Over 5 weeks, this results in a total weight loss of 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds.

On the other hand, Martin's weight gain per week when eating donuts is 1.75 pounds. Over 5 weeks, this results in a total weight gain of 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.

The difference in weight between the two options is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the number of people initially invited by Alex, the number of additional friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Alex initially invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of additional friends is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

The weights of the dogs are as follows:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

The boots cost $16 on Amazon, and shipping costs $4. On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

The difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula for exponential functions. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles every day, we can express this growth using the formula:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t (in days).

To find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (20 feet), we need to solve for t when h(t) > 20.

4 * 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator to approximate the value of log2(5), we get:

t > 2.32

Since t must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is 3.

Therefore, it will take at least 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to multiply the grams of protein he gets per day by 7.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can set up a proportion to find the grams of protein per day.

Let x be the grams of protein per day. We can set up the equation:

200 grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein per cup = x grams of protein per day

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 grams of protein per cup:

x = (200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup) / 1

x = 600 grams of protein per day

Now, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week:

x * 7 = 600 grams of protein per day * 7 days per week

x * 7 = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"Let's dive into the problem of Jerry's age.

We can represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The base price of each implant is $2000, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours to cover the remaining amount.

The final answer is: 260"
"In the context of geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is a fundamental concept. When one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, we can represent the angles as x, 2x, and 3x, respectively.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"As a zoologist specializing in animal behavior and physiology, I can provide a precise calculation for the total number of legs in the pet store.

To determine the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together. 

Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats (Felis catus) have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds (Aves) have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. To find the weight he uses after increasing it by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

The weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so we need to subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight Jamaal uses now is 10 pounds.

"The art of calculating the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is a straightforward problem that can be broken down into manageable parts. As someone who appreciates the sleekness of black, I'll focus on providing a clear and concise solution.

To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas.

Year 1: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 1: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games

Year 2: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so 12 games
- Total games in Year 2: 5 (birthday) + 12 (monthly) = 17 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 17 + 5 = 22 games

Year 3: 
- He gets 5 games for his birthday
- He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so 24 games
- Total games in Year 3: 5 (birthday) + 24 (monthly) = 29 games
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so 29 + 5 = 34 games

Total games after 3 years: 17 (Year 1) + 22 (Year 2) + 34 (Year 3) = 73 games

"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its rate as follows:

Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to find their individual hourly production rates and then multiply those rates by 12.

Ruiz's production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour. 
Marissa's production rate is 3/4 of Ruiz's rate, which is (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"To determine the amount of money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent and subtract it from his original amount.

Let's break down his spending:

On Monday, he spent $8.
On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, so he spent 2 x $8 = $16.
On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spent 4 x $16 = $64.

Total amount spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Original amount = $100

Amount left = Original amount - Total amount spent
= $100 - $88

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. This can be calculated as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. This can be calculated as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"As a tire expert, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the lifespan of the tire.

To find the total number of rotations, we need to multiply the number of miles driven per month by the number of rotations per mile and then multiply by the number of months in a year.

First, let's find the number of rotations per mile:
725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, let's find the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Now, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in 6 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To determine the cost of each pump, we can use the given information. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00, and 2 pumps provide 120 washings. 

First, we find the cost per washing: 
Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by 1:
Cost per pump = $0.20 / 1 = $0.20

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 100 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of $25. 

The discount amount is $25 * 0.3 = $7.50.

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount. Assuming an 8% sales tax rate, the tax amount is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase.

The final amount Joe will have left is -$6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter required per dozen. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can set up the following equation:

Butter needed per day = 4 dozen croissants/day * (1/4 pound/dozen)
Butter needed per day = 4 * (1/4) pound
Butter needed per day = 1 pound

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

Total butter needed = Butter needed per day * 7
Total butter needed = 1 pound * 7
Total butter needed = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"As a pavement engineer specializing in street repaving projects, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs involved.

To calculate the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we need to multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street.

Cost per meter: $194
Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Cost of repaving Lewis' street: $194 × 490 = $94,660

Since the question asks how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

Cost of repaving Monica's street: $194 × 150 = $29,100

Difference in cost: $94,660 - $29,100 = $65,560

Therefore, repaving Lewis' street will cost $65,560 more than repaving Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,560"
"As a researcher in the field of biotechnology, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs associated with John's cancer cell research project.

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000 per month, totaling $500,000. This represents a fixed cost for the initial phase of the research.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This can be modeled using a geometric progression (GP) with a common ratio of 1.5. The funding for each of the remaining 5 months can be calculated as follows:

Month 6: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
Month 7: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
Month 8: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
Month 9: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250
Month 10: $506,250 x 1.5 = $759,375

To find the total cost of the research, we need to sum up the funding for all 10 months. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a GP:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term ($100,000), r is the common ratio (1.5), and n is the number of terms (10).

S = $100,000 * (1 - 1.5^10) / (1 - 1.5)
S = $100,000 * (1 - 7.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * (-6.59375) / (-0.5)
S = $100,000 * 13.1875
S = $1,318,750

However, this calculation is not accurate due to the incorrect application of the formula. A more accurate approach is to calculate the sum of the GP directly:

$100,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 + $1,157,625 + $1,757,812.5 + $2,656,406.25 + $3,989,531.25 = $13,248,687.5

The total cost of John's research is $13,248,687.5."
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the average number of posts per day and the number of days in the month. 

Given that each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 31 days in March, we can calculate the total number of posts as follows:

Total number of posts in March = Average number of posts per day * Total number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 3 * 31
Total number of posts in March = 93

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93."
"As a water conservation expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Gary's water usage and costs.

To calculate the total cost of water for laundry in a year, we need to consider the frequency of laundry, the amount of water used per load, and the cost per gallon. 

Gary does laundry twice a week, which translates to 52 weeks * 2 = 104 loads per year. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, resulting in a total of 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons per year.

"The height of the beanstalk can be calculated by adding the growth in each week. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 3 inches. In the second week, it doubled in height, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. 

To find the total height after 3 weeks, we add the growth in each week: 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 13 inches."
"As a butcher, I can provide a straightforward calculation to determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

To find the total amount of meat sold per day, we multiply the amount of meat sold per hour (15kg) by the number of hours worked per day (10 hours).

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Now, we divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat sold per day (150kg) to find the number of days it will take to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators and parents, and then subtract that from the total number of seats.

First, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators:
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by parents:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 54 seats = 0 seats

However, this is not possible, as there must be some students present. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation is:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats * 1/3 = 24 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 24 seats = 30 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 30.

The final answer is: 30"

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left, we can break down his gum-chewing activities throughout the day.

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. 

At school, he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

On the way home from school, he chews 1 piece of gum.

After dinner, he chews 1 piece of gum.

Total gum chewed: 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces of gum.

Remaining gum: 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second and then multiply by the number of seconds in an hour.

First, we convert 20 kb to Mb: 20 kb ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the speed by 60:
0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"As a transportation expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to calculate the total number of cars towed that week.

Let's start by calculating the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, we can multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. The problem states that the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Since there are 4 remaining days, we can multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, we can add the total number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days to get the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"As a seasoned automotive finance expert, I can break down the problem into manageable components to determine James' earnings.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars to the company. Since they paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars, we can calculate this as:

Cost per car = $25,000 * 0.3 = $7,500

Total cost for 10 cars = $7,500 * 10 = $75,000

Next, we calculate the profit per car by subtracting the cost from the selling price:

Profit per car = $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500

Total profit for 10 cars = $17,500 * 10 = $175,000

Finally, James' commission is 10% of the total profit:

Commission = 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"

"As a jewelry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel, which is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we can add their individual prices:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so S = 16.

We also know that he bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so T = S + 3.

Finally, he bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so R = T - 9.

Substituting the expression for T into the equation for R, we get R = (S + 3) - 9.

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the equation for R: R = (16 + 3) - 9 = 10.

Now that we have the values for S, T, and R, we can find the total number of stamps by adding them together: Total = S + T + R = 16 + (16 + 3) + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since Bob is driving 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob as 't' hours. In this time, Bob will cover a distance of 55t miles, and Tom will cover a distance of 70t miles.

Since Bob is initially 75 miles ahead of Tom, we can set up the equation:

70t = 55t + 75

Subtracting 55t from both sides gives us:

15t = 75

Dividing both sides by 15 gives us:

t = 5

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 5"
"Let's dive into the world of fish catching. As a fisheries expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. Since Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we can calculate Darren's catch as follows:

Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6
Darren's fish = 11

Now, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. To find Tommy's catch, we can add 3 to Darren's catch:

Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tommy's fish = 11 + 3
Tommy's fish = 14

"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. To find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes: 

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. To do this, we subtract the number of classes he has already signed up for from the maximum number of classes:

10 (classes signed up for) - 6 (maximum classes) = 4 classes

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel. 

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To find the value of L, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current monthly salary of $20,000. This can be calculated as:

Raise = 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the raise and bonus to the current monthly salary to get the new monthly salary:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

Yearly salary = $31,000 x 12 = $372,000

"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information step by step.

First, we know Steve's age is 60 years. His wife is 4 years older than him, so her age is 60 + 4 = 64 years.

Since their son is half as old as his mother, we can calculate his age by dividing his mother's age by 2: 64 / 2 = 32 years.

Now, we are given that the son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. To find her age, we subtract 3 from the son's age: 32 - 3 = 29 years.

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to calculate the total weight of flour in one bag and then multiply it by 3.

Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.

Now, we multiply the total amount of flour in one bag by 3 to get the total amount of flour in three bags: 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Alisa, the distance she biked is:
12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley, the distance he biked is:
10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, let's add the distances together:
54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay.

As a geotechnical engineer, I can tell you that the rate of digging through soil and clay is crucial in well construction. Bill's digging rate through soil is 4 feet per hour, and through clay, it's half that, which is 2 feet per hour.

Time to dig through soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours
Time to dig through clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours
Total time = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for everyone, we'll multiply the number of people by 2.

Number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Total number of cupcakes = 27 x 2 = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the initial number of likes and add the new likes.

First, we know that the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes. Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. We can set up the equation:

Initial likes + 20000 = 70x

We also know that the initial likes are 2000. We can substitute this value into the equation:

2000 + 20000 = 70x
21000 = 70x

To find the initial number of likes, we can divide both sides by 70:

x = 21000 / 70
x = 300

Now, we can find the total number of likes by adding the initial likes and the new likes:

Total likes = Initial likes + 20000
Total likes = 300 + 20000
Total likes = 20100

The final answer is 20100."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in the final prices paid for pomegranates on two different days. To approach this, we need to consider the initial cost, discount, and final price for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount. The total cost on Tuesday can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost (Tuesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= (20 * $20) - $2
= $400 - $2
= $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost (Wednesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
= (20 * $30) - (0.1 * $600)
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

Difference = Total Cost (Tuesday) - Total Cost (Wednesday)
= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This implies that the sales from green hats in the first month were twice the sales from red hats, which is 2 x $400 = $800.

To find the total sales in the first month, we add the sales from red hats and green hats: $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4: 3/4 x $1200 = $900.

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales in the first and second months: $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we need to consider the time period and the hourly rates.

The carriage rental period is from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, James receives 1 hour of free time, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we can use a simple subtraction equation. Let's break it down step by step:

Initial bank account balance: $200
Final bank account balance: $420
Weekly wage: $300

The difference between the final and initial bank account balances represents the amount withheld from Sally's wage. To find this amount, we subtract the initial bank account balance from the final bank account balance:

$420 - $200 = $220

However, this amount exceeds the weekly wage, indicating that Sally's bank account was overdrawn. To find the actual amount withheld, we subtract the weekly wage from the difference:

$220 - $300 = -$80

Since the result is negative, it means that $80 was withheld from Sally's wage.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs needed for the party, we must consider the ratio of deviled egg halves to eggs. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. This implies that 1 egg is equivalent to 2 deviled egg halves.

Number of guests: 16
Number of deviled egg halves per guest: 3

Total deviled egg halves needed: 16 x 3 = 48

Since 1 egg is equivalent to 2 deviled egg halves, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs needed.

Total eggs needed: 48 / 2 = 24

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12.

Total dozens of eggs needed: 24 / 12 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from 1.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, she has 2/3 of the paper left to write. 

To find 2/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 2 and divide by 3.

2/3 of 15 = (2 * 15) / 3
= 30 / 3
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day

Given that the total number of pages is 200 and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day, we can plug in the values as follows:

Number of days = 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can calculate the number of days before the deadline as follows:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly rent, and monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we need to calculate the individual cooking times for each food item. 

We know that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Therefore, the cooking time for beans is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we add up the cooking times for all three foods: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans. The total cooking time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"The problem at hand involves comparing the cost of two different mixtures of nuts. To approach this, we can use the concept of weighted averages.

Let's denote the cost of almonds as A and the cost of walnuts as W. We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

The first mixture consists of 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. To find the total cost of this mixture, we can calculate the weighted average:

Cost of the first mixture = (1/2)A + (1/3)W
= (1/2)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 5 + 5
= $10

The second mixture consists of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. Similarly, we can calculate the total cost of this mixture:

Cost of the second mixture = (1/5)A + (1/3)W
= (1/5)(10) + (1/3)(15)
= 2 + 5
= $7

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

Difference in cost = Cost of the first mixture - Cost of the second mixture
= $10 - $7
= $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the coffee and donut, we need to consider the cost of the more expensive brand, which is 20% more than the normal brand. 

The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and 20% of $5 is $1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Since Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds, the total cost of the more expensive brand is 7 x $6 = $42.

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, we get a total cost of $42 + $2 = $44.

The final answer is $44."
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased and subtract that from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, calculate the total cost of the chips: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Next, calculate the total cost of the chicken and soda: $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00
Now, add the cost of the chips and the chicken and soda: $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00

To find the cost of the apple pie, subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

The total amount of money they have is the sum of their individual amounts:

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
= 120 + 90 + 150
= 360

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

Shared amount = Total amount / 3
= 360 / 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can analyze the given information. Christina's mood records show that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This pattern suggests a repeating cycle of 8 days, with 4 days being good and 4 days being bad.

Given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month as follows:

Total good days = 12 (initial good days) + 3 (new good days) = 15

Since the cycle repeats every 8 days, we can divide the total good days by 8 to find the number of complete cycles:

15 ÷ 8 = 1 with a remainder of 7

This means that there is 1 complete cycle of 8 good days, and 7 additional good days.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 7.

The final answer is 7."
"Let's analyze the problem step by step. We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent the number of books Sally has as x. This can be expressed as an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To solve for x, we'll isolate x by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of x:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: 12"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs one toy. This implies that the initial number of toys is sufficient for the initial number of dogs. However, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys. However, when James came back, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.

To find the total number of toys James needs, we can add the initial number of toys he had (4) to the number of toys he needs to buy (9). This gives us 4 + 9 = 13 toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 13 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"To determine the amount Skyler invested, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 * (2/5) = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 * (2/3) = 480

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:

720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their goal and the total number of signatures they already have.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they have is C + J = 20 + 44 = 64.

Since they want to reach 100 signatures, we can set up an equation: C + J + x = 100, where x is the number of signatures they need to collect. We can substitute the values of C and J into the equation: 20 + 44 + x = 100.

Now, let's solve for x: 64 + x = 100. Subtracting 64 from both sides gives us x = 36.

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."

"The cookie conundrum. A classic problem that requires a dash of mathematical finesse. As a cookie connoisseur, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of cookies Katarina has as K, Max has as M, the Cookie Monster has as C, and Summer has as S. We're given the following information:

1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23
4. K = 68

We can start by substituting the value of K from equation (1) into equation (4):
68 = M - 5
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Now that we have the value of M, we can find the value of C using equation (2):
C = M - 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can find the value of S using equation (3):
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

To find the total number of cookies, we add the values of K, M, C, and S:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

"To find the original length of the dress, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."

"As a baking expert, I can confidently calculate the number of cookies left in the box. 

To determine the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. Since Greta bakes 30 cookies, Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: 80"
"Let's tackle this problem with a clear and concise approach.

We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can represent the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since we are dealing with whole numbers, we can round down the age of the younger triplet to 7 and the age of the older triplet to 14, as the fractional part doesn't make sense in this context.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before dinner. 

First, we convert 3 hours into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time for all his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to consider the individual costs of each item. 

The cost of one lollipop is $0.40, so the cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of one candy is $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rong saves 20 coins per month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. To find Neil's monthly savings, we can calculate 2/5 of Rong's savings and add it to Rong's savings.

Neil's monthly savings = Rong's monthly savings + (2/5 * Rong's monthly savings)
= 20 + (2/5 * 20)
= 20 + 8
= 28

Now, let's calculate their total savings after 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply their monthly savings by 120 (12 * 10).

Rong's total savings = 20 * 120
= 2400

Neil's total savings = 28 * 120
= 3360

The total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years is the sum of their individual savings.

Total coins = Rong's total savings + Neil's total savings
= 2400 + 3360
= 5760

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"
"As a veterinarian, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation. The total cost of the vaccines is $40, and the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. To find the total bill, we can set up the equation: 

0.6x = 40

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 0.6:
x = 40 / 0.6
x = 66.67

The total bill is $66.67. Now, we subtract the total bill from the amount John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with:
$125 - $66.67 = $58.33

The final answer is: $58.33"
"As a fruit pricing expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs involved in creating a crate of fresh fruit.

To calculate the total cost of the crate, we need to consider the individual costs of each type of fruit. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the expressions for B and G into the equation for W:
W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for W:
W = 14 - 2
W = 12

Now that we have the number of each color, we can calculate the total area:
Total area = R + B + G + W
Total area = 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + 12
Total area = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total area = 68

The total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet."
"To determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs, we must first calculate the total number of chairs required. 

There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Assuming each adult requires one chair and each baby requires a high chair, the total number of chairs needed is:

Total chairs = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies) = 57

Since the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

Number of regular chairs = 8 * 5 = 40

Total chairs available = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48

To find the number of additional chairs needed, subtract the total available chairs from the total required:

Additional chairs needed = 57 (total required) - 48 (total available) = 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we can use the concept of percentages. Since 20% of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as follows:

"To determine the total points collected by the students, we need to calculate the points for each student.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is 145 points short of the minimum threshold to go on the trip."
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each of Great Grandma Jones' children has three children, and each of those children has three babies of their own, we can represent this as a geometric progression.

Let's break it down:

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
Each of her children has 3 children, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.

Now, each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

Final Answer: The final answer is 27."
"To calculate Greta's remaining funds, we need to determine the amounts allocated for her retirement account and car payment.

Greta's paycheck is $2400. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, which is 0.5 * $2400 = $1200. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, which is 0.2 * $2400 = $480.

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the allocated funds from her original paycheck:

$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first find the total number of pencils. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to calculate the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks in the city:
15 boxes of 20 fireworks each = 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks

Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to calculate 40% of 300:
0.4 * 300 = 120 fireworks

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard:
3 boxes of 5 fireworks each = 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard:
120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135 fireworks

"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can use the information provided. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and each male ate 1 more than each female, we can express the number of dumplings eaten by each male as 3 + 1 = 4.

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as F and the number of dumplings eaten by each male as M. We know that F = 3 and M = F + 1.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8M, and the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6F. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females.

We can set up the equation: 8M + 6F = Total dumplings

Substituting M = F + 1, we get: 8(F + 1) + 6F = Total dumplings
Expanding the equation: 8F + 8 + 6F = Total dumplings
Combine like terms: 14F + 8 = Total dumplings

We know that F = 3, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 14(3) + 8 = Total dumplings
Simplifying the equation: 42 + 8 = Total dumplings
Evaluating the expression: 50 = Total dumplings

Final answer: 50"

"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Given that the turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed, and the cat's speed is 15 feet/second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:

Distance = Turtle's speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

"As a hydrologist specializing in water resource management, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Given that the city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes as follows:

Let's denote the total water used by the city as 0.4 (40%) and the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as 0.8 (80%). To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 1 (or 100%):

1 - 0.8 = 0.2

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.2 * 100 = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the Colorado River's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can use the formula for average:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

Given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time taken by dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we can plug in the values into the average formula:

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Next, we find the number of people remaining after midday:
5000 - 2000 = 3000

Then, we calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 (2/3 of the remaining people):
3000 * (2/3) = 2000

Finally, we find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00:
3000 - 2000 = 1000

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can use the following calculation:

Number of packs = Total number of days / Number of pieces of gum per day
= 30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days. Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum.

The correct answer is: 8"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we must first calculate the total number of smores required. 

We know that 9 kids want 2 smores each, and 6 adults want 1 s'more each. The total number of smores needed is:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 smores, we can divide the total number of smores by 8 to find the number of sleeves needed:
24 smores / 8 smores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need to divide the total number of sleeves by 3 to find the number of boxes needed:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is 1.

Final answer: $\boxed{1}$"
"To calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we can start by finding her father's age. Since Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as an equation:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 38 years

Next, we can find Dora's mother's age by subtracting 4 years from her father's age:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34 years

Now, we can calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
= 15 + 38 + 34
= 87 years

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To determine the amount of money each sibling received, we can use the concept of division. Since there are 4 siblings, including Greg, we divide the total amount of money ($20) by 4.

"To calculate the total weight of Cindy's books, we need to add the weights of all the books together.

The weights of the books are as follows:
- Math and science books: 2 pounds each, so 2 x 2 = 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the votes, while candidate B secured 50% more votes than candidate A. To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can calculate the votes for candidate B first.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B's votes = 20 + 50% of 20 = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 30 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 100, we can find candidate C's votes by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total.

Candidate C's votes = 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial amount of apples each person has and the number of apples Boris gives to Beck.

Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new amount becomes 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount: 100 - 87 = 13.

The final answer is 13."
"To determine the amount of water left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and subtract it from the initial 32 ounces.

Let's break it down:

Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Total water used: 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has.

Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'S' and the number of books Alice has as 'A'. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so we can write an equation: 
C = 2S

We are also given that Clara has 20 books, so we can substitute 20 for C: 
20 = 2S

To find the value of S, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 
A = S + 6
A = 10 + 6
A = 16

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of books Clara and Alice have by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total: 
Difference = C - A
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is 4."
"As a milk expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem.

To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, we need to find the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

Total cost = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total cost = $50 + $48
Total cost = $98

The final answer is: $98"
"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

Let's denote the total number of students as T, the number of students who like to bake as B, the number of students who like to play basketball as C, the number of students who like to play video games as V, and the number of students who like to play music as M. We are given that T = 50, B = 10, and C = 5.

We are also given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, so M = 2C = 2 * 5 = 10.

Since the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball is B + C = 10 + 5 = 15, we can find the number of students who like to play video games or play music by subtracting this from the total number of students: T - (B + C) = 50 - 15 = 35.

Now, we know that M = 10, so the number of students who like to play video games is V = (T - (B + C)) - M = 35 - 10 = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we need to consider the initial number of birds and the subsequent additions.

Initially, there were 12 birds. Then, 1/3 of that number was scared away, which is equivalent to 12 * (1/3) = 4 birds.

The remaining birds after the initial scare are 12 - 4 = 8.

Later, 20 more birds joined the backyard. To find the total number of birds now, we add the remaining birds to the new additions: 8 + 20 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of birds in the backyard is 28.

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the total number of students in each class as x. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = x - 16
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the number of cake slices remaining on the plate, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake. Mara added 3 slices, resulting in a total of 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Next, she tripled the number of slices, which can be calculated as 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After that, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices on the plate.

Finally, her friend stole 5 slices, so the remaining number of slices is 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

The final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

"The art of calculating profit from a treasure trove of magic cards. As a connoisseur of all things numerical, I shall dissect the problem with precision.

Mark's initial investment is calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the cost per pack: 3 packs * $1800 per pack = $5400.

The total value of the cards Mark discovered can be determined by adding the values of the two exceptional cards and the 30 cards worth $50 each: $4000 + $1000 + (30 * $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

The final answer is: $1100"
"To determine the cost savings of choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost of each park and then find the difference.

The first amusement park charges $26 per adult and $12 per child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:
$26 * 2 (adults) + $12 * 2 (children) = $52 + $24 = $76

The second amusement park charges $14 per adult and $10 per child. With 2 adults and 2 children, the total cost is:
$14 * 2 (adults) + $10 * 2 (children) = $28 + $20 = $48

To find the cost savings, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first:
$76 - $48 = $28

Therefore, the family will be able to save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

"To calculate the daily savings, we need to find the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The old vendor charges $0.5 per tomato, while the new vendor charges $0.4 per tomato. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.

Since the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, the daily savings can be calculated as:

Daily savings = (Cost per tomato) * (Number of tomatoes sold per day)
= $0.1 * 500
= $50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
= $50 * 7
= $350

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sean has 56 marbles, and he has half as many marbles as Cal. To find out how many marbles Cal has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. To find out how many marbles Carl has, we can multiply Sean's marbles by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Now, we can find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined by adding their marbles together.

Carl and Cal's marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Carl and Cal's marbles = 224 + 112
Carl and Cal's marbles = 336

"As a primatologist specializing in the behavior and social dynamics of great apes, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Gunther, the western lowland gorilla, initially had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch. When he wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile. This is consistent with the observed behavior of chimpanzees, which often engage in opportunistic foraging and may exhibit aggressive behavior when competing for food.

The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, which is a common behavior among primates, as they often cache food for later use. However, later that evening, Arnold stole 12 of the bananas, which is also consistent with the observed behavior of chimpanzees, which may engage in food theft when they perceive an opportunity.

On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile, which is a common behavior among primates, as they often engage in foraging and caching activities. By adding these new bananas to his pile, Gunther was able to re-establish a stable food cache, which is essential for the survival and well-being of great apes.

Therefore, the total number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

Now, she has 3 small stickers + 60 small stickers = 63 small stickers.
She has 20 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine now has 63 small stickers + 20 large stickers = 83 buttons.

"In the context of voting systems and statistical analysis, I can provide a refined response.

When analyzing the voting outcome, we can use the concept of a simple majority. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

We know that the total number of council members is 33, and the sum of votes in favor and against must equal 33. This forms a linear equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now that we know x, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:

2x = 2(11) = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To calculate the total number of shirts, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of students for each size as follows:
- Extra-small: x
- Small: 2x
- Medium: 2x - 4
- Large: (2x - 4) / 2
- Extra-large: ((2x - 4) / 2) + 6

Since we know the number of students for each size, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of students:
x + 2x + (2x - 4) + ((2x - 4) / 2) + (((2x - 4) / 2) + 6) = total

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:
5x - 4 + (2x - 4) + (x - 2) + (x + 3) = total
Combine like terms:
8x - 7 = total

Now, we need to find the value of x. Since we know that the number of students for each size is a whole number, we can try different values of x to find the solution.

Let's try x = 7:
8(7) - 7 = 56 - 7 = 49

Since x = 7 results in a whole number, we can conclude that the total number of shirts is 49.

To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can multiply both sides by 3:
Total Pomeranians = 6 * 3
Total Pomeranians = 18

Since 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can set up another equation:
2/3 * Total Puppies = 18

To find the total number of puppies, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:
Total Puppies = 18 * 3/2
Total Puppies = 27

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies."
"To determine how much Jayden needs to buy the camera, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. We can calculate the total amount of money Jayden has by adding the money he already has to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Since the camera costs $200, we can find out how much more Jayden needs by subtracting the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Final Answer: The final answer is $85."
"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the total, it will need 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need 2x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 125 + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x + 125 = 250

Subtract 125 from both sides:

3x = 125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 41.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to express the answer as a decimal, as it represents a fraction of a case.

The third house needs 2x cases, which is 2 * 41.67 = 83.33 cases.

"Let's dive into the world of fruit quantities. As a fruit connoisseur, I'll provide a precise calculation to determine the total number of fruits George has.

Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Let B be the number of bananas and P be the number of pears.

Since George has 200 bananas, we can substitute B = 200 into the equation:

P = B + 0.45B
P = 200 + 0.45(200)
P = 200 + 90
P = 290

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears:

Total Fruits = B + P
Total Fruits = 200 + 290
Total Fruits = 490

The final answer is: 490"

"To determine the total number of books read, we need to first find out how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find out how many Ahmed read.

Let's denote the number of books Ahmed read as x. We know that Ezra read 300 books initially, and then he read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450.

We can set up the equation: 2x = 450, where x is the number of books Ahmed read.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 450 / 2 = 225.

Now, we can add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed to find the total number of books read: 450 (Ezra) + 225 (Ahmed) = 675.

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Her total earnings for the hour-based pay would be:
2 classes * 2 hours * $15 per hour = $30

As she also teaches more than 3 classes on Wednesday, she earns a daily bonus of $5. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday would be:
$30 + $5 = $35

To find Tanya's total earnings for the two days, we add her earnings for both days:
$65 + $35 = $100

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the difference in the number of vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we can calculate the total number of each type of scent sold.

Vanilla scents sold: 5 * 4 = 20
Fruity scents sold: 2 * 8 = 16

Now, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
20 - 16 = 4

The company sold 4 more vanilla scents compared to the fruity scents.

Final answer: 4"
"As a farmer specializing in crop pricing and revenue optimization, I can help Bennet determine the optimal price for each ear of corn to reach his target revenue of $135.

To calculate the required revenue from corn, we need to subtract the revenue from eggplants from the total target revenue. Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the revenue from eggplants is:

20 * 3 = $60

Now, we subtract this from the total target revenue:

$135 - $60 = $75

Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn, we divide the remaining revenue by the number of ears:

$75 ÷ 25 = $3

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to reach his target revenue.

Final answer: $3"
"To determine the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer, we need to calculate the time spent on soccer and divide it by the total weekend time.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. She spends 3 hours reading and 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games. 

First, we find the remaining time after reading: 12 - 3 = 9 hours. Then, we calculate the time spent playing video games: 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours. 

Now, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend time to find the time spent playing soccer: 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 hours.

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we divide the time spent playing soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100: (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, the percentage of Tatiana's weekend spent playing soccer is 50%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{50}$"
"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Anthony initially had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is equivalent to 25 pencils. This leaves him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3 and divide by 5:

(3/5) × 25 = (3 × 25) / 5
= 75 / 5
= 15

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. To find the number of pencils he kept, we subtract 15 from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Total time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left in the box, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys.

The number of wheels needed for the cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
The number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Total number of wheels needed = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left in the box is 276.

Final Answer: The final answer is 276."
"To calculate the discounted price of the laptop, we need to find 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The formula for finding the discount amount is: Discount = (Discount Percentage * Original Price) / 100

In this case, the discount percentage is 20% and the original price is $1000.

Discount = (20 * $1000) / 100
Discount = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $1000 - $200
Discounted Price = $800

Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Cost per pound of peaches * pounds of peaches) + (Cost per pound of plums * pounds of plums) + (Cost per pound of apricots * pounds of apricots)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total Cost = ($2.00 * 6) + ($1.00 * 8) + ($3.00 * 6)
Total Cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total Cost = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the vacation spot, we can use the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

Given that the Llesis family drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and hiked at an average speed of 20 miles per hour (5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed), we can calculate the distance they covered while hiking.

Let's denote the time spent driving as 'd' hours and the time spent hiking as 1.5 hours. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can set up the equation:
d + 1.5 = 6

Solving for 'd', we get:
d = 6 - 1.5
d = 4.5 hours

Now, we can calculate the distance covered while driving:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 50 * 4.5
Distance = 225 miles

The distance to their vacation spot is 225 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{225}$"
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate their individual scores based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

Emma's score: 
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: $\boxed{895}$"
"To determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas, we can use the following equation:

Total Cost = Cost of Two Pizzas + Cost of Remaining Two Pizzas
64 = 30 + Cost of Remaining Two Pizzas

Subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost:
64 - 30 = 34

Now, divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas:
Cost of Remaining Two Pizzas = 34 / 2
Cost of Remaining Two Pizzas = 17

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, which can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15. 

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so we multiply 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has -11 orange fish and 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2(1)

However, this equation is not true. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say Bob took out x orange fish and y white fish. We know that x + y = 17 (since the total number of fish taken out is 17). We also know that 3 - x = -11 (since the number of orange fish left is -11) and 4 - y = 1 (since the number of white fish left is 1).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we get x = -11 + 3 = -8. Substituting this value into the first equation, we get -8 + y = 17. Solving for y, we get y = 25.

However, this is not possible since the total number of fish taken out is 17. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

Let's say Bob took out 14 orange fish and y white fish. We know that 3 - 14 = -11 (since the number of orange fish left is -11) and 4 - y = 1 (since the number of white fish left is 1).

"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can help you calculate the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car.

To determine the total distance traveled in a week, we need to consider the one-way distance between Andy's home and office, which is 5 miles. Since he travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is:

Total distance = 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week using the car's fuel efficiency:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
= 25 miles / 10 MPG
= 2.5 gallons

To find the cost of gas consumed per week, we multiply the gas consumed per week by the price per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount she spent on twenties is 6 * 20 = $120.

She also spent all 140 quarters, which is equivalent to 140 * 0.25 = $35.

The total amount she spent is the sum of the amount spent on twenties and the amount spent on quarters: $120 + $35 = $155.

The final answer is: $155"

* Analog TVs: 1/8 of 40 = 5 TVs

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to subtract the total number of non-OLED TVs from the total number of TVs sold.

Total non-OLED TVs = Smart TVs + Analog TVs
= 10 + 5
= 15 TVs

Number of OLED TVs = Total TVs - Total non-OLED TVs
= 40 - 15
= 25 TVs

Therefore, Samwell's store sold 25 OLED TVs this week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the remaining cost of the trip that he needs to cover. Since the school is covering half the cost, John needs to cover the other half.

The total cost of the trip is $300. Since the school is covering half, John needs to cover $300 / 2 = $150.

John has $50, so he is missing $150 - $50 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must consider the temperature difference between the day and night, as well as the heating capacity of each log. 

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the required number of logs as follows:

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heating capacity per log
= 12 / 5
= 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we need to calculate the number of groups that had members bring back seashells and multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

Number of seashells = Number of groups * Number of seashells per group
= 3/5 * 10 * 2
= 3/5 * 20
= 12

Therefore, the total number of seashells collected is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train, we can follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in animal behavior and enclosure management, I can confidently calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure.

To determine the total number of lions, we need to consider the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = 12 (female lions) / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to find 25% of the original price and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. To find 25% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.25.

$40 x 0.25 = $10

The discounted price of the jeans is $40 - $10 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $30 = $20

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over.

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the formula for the total salary paid:

"As a music enthusiast and choir conductor, I can provide a precise calculation for the total caroling time.

To determine the total time, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds.

Final answer: 540"
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally, we need to determine their hourly wages and then multiply by the number of hours worked.

Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Since both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Billy's total earnings: 20 hours * $11.50 per hour = $230
Sally's total earnings: 20 hours * $10.50 per hour = $210

To find the difference in their earnings, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can use the following formula:

Cost of 3 loaves of bread = 3 x $2 = $6

"To find the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Pierson's score = 278
Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139
Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150

Now, let's add their scores together:
Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the number of students and teachers participating in the reforestation campaign.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. This gives us a total of 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Additionally, there are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. As each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and set up an equation to find the number of goats that will make up 30% of her total collection.

Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs, making a total of:

3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming time into two segments: the first 2 weeks and the last week.

Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days in the first 2 weeks, which equals 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours. In the last week, she plays for 2 hours per day for 7 days, totaling 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours played by Kris is 7 + 14 = 21 hours. To earn the achievement, she needs 30 hours. Therefore, Kris needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

"When two cars are traveling at different speeds on a highway, the distance between them can be determined by considering their relative motion. In this scenario, the first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.

To find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since the second car is traveling faster, it will cover more distance in the same time frame. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference in their speeds, which is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.

The distance between the two cars after 2 hours can be calculated by multiplying the relative speed by the time:

Distance = Relative Speed * Time
= 10 miles/hour * 2 hours
= 20 miles

Therefore, after 2 hours, there will be 20 miles between the two cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to determine the cost of the premium. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

"To calculate the overall pass rate, we need to consider the number of students who passed in each grade and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total area of the mosaic and then divide it by the height. Since the area of a rectangle is length * width, and we know the height (3 inches), we can find the length.

Let's denote the number of bags as 'b', the number of chips per bag as 'c', and the number of chips per square inch as 's'. We are given that b = 2, c = 72, and s = 12.

First, we calculate the total number of chips: b * c = 2 * 72 = 144.

Next, we find the total area: total area = total chips / chips per square inch = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.

Since the height is 3 inches, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height: length = total area / height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches.

"To determine the initial amount of tea, we need to calculate the total amount consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 candies, he now has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies: 200 - 50 = 150.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 candies to sell all of his candy.

Final Answer: The final answer is 150."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can model this as an exponential function.

"As a tree climber and arborist, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate the total number of petals in the vase, we need to consider the number of petals from each type of flower and account for the ones dropped.

Let's break it down:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type, we need to subtract the total number of petals dropped (5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals) from the total picked.

Total petals in the vase: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

The final answer is: 79"
"To determine the number of S'mores each kid can have, we need to calculate the total number of marshmallows remaining after dropping 3 and then divide that by 2.

Total marshmallows = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3
Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 3 = 32

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the total number of S'mores they can make is 32.

John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores.

To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we divide the total number of S'mores they can make by 2.

Number of S'mores each kid can have = 32 / 2 = 16

Therefore, John and DeSean can each have 16 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final answer: 16"
"To calculate the total amount of money used, we need to determine the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's break down the time each person played:

- Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
- The friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.
- The other friend also plays for 120 minutes, so they will use 6 quarters.
- The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"The art of crafting the perfect salt scrub. As a connoisseur of all things black (my favorite color, of course), I can appreciate the nuances of this recipe. Let's dive into the world of proportions.

We're given that the amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, and the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar. Let's denote the amount of salt as x. Since the amount of citrus zest and fragrance is x, we can express the total amount of these ingredients as 2x.

Now, we're told that the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt. So, the amount of oil is 2x.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. We can set up the equation:

x + x + 2x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 10/6

x = 5/3

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 5/3 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x
Oil = 2 * (5/3)
Oil = 10/3

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}$"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. This means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.2: 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find the number of cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from the number he had after selling: 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we need to calculate the total amount raised by the students and then divide it by the number of students.

The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

"The problem at hand involves a system of linear equations, which can be solved using algebraic methods. Let's represent the number of cards each person has with variables.

Let x be the number of cards PJ has. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We know that Cindy had 5 green eggs, so G = 5.

We also know that she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so B = 2G = 2(5) = 10.

Additionally, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so Y = P/3 = 9/3 = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs of each color together:
Total = G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To calculate the amount Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
Weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find the amount Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price and add the shipping cost:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price + Shipping cost - Refund amount
= $32 + $3.00 - $24
= $11

The final answer is: $11"

"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to analyze the production pattern. Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week, then halves the production in the second week, and triples it in the third week. This indicates a non-linear relationship between the weeks.

Let's calculate the production for the fourth week:

Week 1: 8,000 bars
Week 2: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
Week 3: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

Since the production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars, we can subtract this from the total monthly production to find the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks: 36,000 bars
Production for the fourth week: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider her weekly activities. 

First, let's calculate the time she spends on each activity:

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/week * 60 minutes/hour = 0.25 hours/week
Time spent on TikTok (filming, editing, etc.): 18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 0.75 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 2 hours + 0.25 hours + 0.75 hours = 2.95 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 2.95 hours/week * 4 weeks = 11.8 hours

The final answer is: 11.8"
"As an interior design expert, I'll break down the costs for Angela's installation.

First, let's calculate the cost of the standard items:
- 4 mirrors: $129.00
- 2 shelves: $0 (since shelves are not mentioned as part of the installation)
- 1 chandelier: $129.00
- 10 pictures: $0 (since pictures are not mentioned as part of the installation)

The total cost of the standard items is: $129.00 + $0 + $129.00 + $0 = $258.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the additional items:
- 2 extra mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $258.00 + $195.00 = $453.00

The final answer is: $453.00"
"To determine Roy's savings, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and add it to Anthony's total. 

First, we find 40% of Anthony's savings. Since Anthony has $30, 40% of $30 is 0.4 x $30 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"The art of mountain lifting is a fascinating topic, and as a geology enthusiast, I'd be delighted to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We're given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch. We know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches. Then, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, which means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches). Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. 

Mason travels at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, and then for another 6 hours. 

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
Total distance = 80 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we can use the given information to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of dishes Kora made as K. We know that K = 20.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so the number of dishes Rory made is K + 20.

Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so the number of dishes Jada made is 2(K + 20).

The total number of dishes made by all three is the sum of the individual amounts: K + (K + 20) + 2(K + 20).

Substituting K = 20, we get:
20 + (20 + 20) + 2(20 + 20)
= 20 + 40 + 2(40)
= 20 + 40 + 80
= 140

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora is 140."
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving the additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika already has some savings in her purse, and she has been paid $150 for her part-time job. Her mom also agreed to give her $80. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We know that x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50.

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then subtract the number of slices Adam ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate (15 slices) from the total number of slices: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the number of cows needed as x. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, the total milk production is 3 * 5 = 15 liters. We want to find the value of x such that the total milk production is 25 liters.

The equation can be set up as follows:

3 * 5 + x * 5 = 25

Combine like terms:

15 + 5x = 25

Subtract 15 from both sides:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 2"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we can use simple subtraction. 

Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and received $200 from his brother. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Gabriel has: $5,000 + $200 = $5,200.

Now, subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost of the items: $10,000 + $800 = $10,800. 

$10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600.

Gabriel still needs $5,600.

Final answer: $5600"
"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the price of the hat ($70) from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman ($80).

"Let's break down Craig's expenses. He has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which is a total of $40. He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12. He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

Final Answer: The final answer is $19."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and has twice as many dishes as socks. To find the number of socks Jack has, we can divide 60 by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply 30 by 2 to find the number of socks Peter has:

30 × 2 = 60 socks

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together:

60 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 120 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can set up an equation to find the number of socks Jack has:

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as x. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, the number of dishes Jack has is 2x. We know that Jack has 60 dishes, so we can set up the equation:

2x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 60 ÷ 2
x = 30

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of dishes he has:

2x = 2(30)
2x = 60

We already know that Jack has 60 dishes.

To find the total number of dishes they have together, we can add the number of dishes Jack has to the number of dishes Peter has. Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can multiply 60 by 1/2:

60 × 1/2 = 30

Now, we can add the number of dishes Jack has to the number of dishes Peter has:

60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use a Venn diagram or a simple set theory approach. Let's break it down:

We know that there are 20 students in total. 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. To find the number of students good at both math and English, we subtract the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time and subtract the time taken by each group.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to consider the 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total available time is:

Total available time = 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes

The time taken by each group is 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage). To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the total available time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time taken by each group
= 130 minutes / 10 minutes
= 13

Since Vicki can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 13.

Final answer: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we need to calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we can calculate the total amount after 3 years:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = P + Interest = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = P + Interest = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.

First, we find the number of white shirts with no collars. Since half of the white shirts have collars, the other half do not. 

Number of white shirts with no collars = Total number of white shirts / 2
= 40 / 2
= 20

Next, we find the number of floral shirts with no buttons. We know that 20 floral shirts have buttons, so the number of floral shirts with no buttons is the total number of floral shirts minus the number of floral shirts with buttons.

Number of floral shirts with no buttons = Total number of floral shirts - Number of floral shirts with buttons
= 50 - 20
= 30

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars.

Difference = Number of floral shirts with no buttons - Number of white shirts with no collars
= 30 - 20
= 10

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of goats left in Farm X. Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

55 - 10 = 45

Next, we calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

45 - 20 = 25

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms:

45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

The final answer is: 70"
"To calculate the average cost of each pair of shoes, we can divide the total amount spent on shoes per year by the number of pairs bought per year.

Total amount spent per year = $2640
Number of pairs bought per year = 2

Average cost per pair = Total amount spent per year / Number of pairs bought per year
= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To calculate the total cost of the baskets of food, we need to consider the cost of both green and red food. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
3 * $18 = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can use the formula:

Time = (Number of rooms / 2) * Time per room

Given that there are 90 rooms and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = (90 / 2) * 20
Time = 45 * 20
Time = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 900 / 60
Time = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Final answer: 15"
"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break it down into three separate calculations.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the following information:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then:
- Your brother's age is x + 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 2.
- Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We can re-express the equation as 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try different values of x to satisfy the equation.

Let's try x = 15: 
- Your age is 15.
- Your brother's age is 15 + 3 = 18.
- Your sister's age is 15 - 2 = 13.
- Your mom's age is 3(18) - 1 = 53.

The sum of your ages is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 14: 
- Your age is 14.
- Your brother's age is 14 + 3 = 17.
- Your sister's age is 14 - 2 = 12.
- Your mom's age is 3(17) - 1 = 50.

The sum of your ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 
- Your age is 13.
- Your brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16.
- Your sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11.
- Your mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of your ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

The solution to the problem is x = 13.

"As a hydrologist specializing in river flow dynamics, I can provide a precise calculation for the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day.

Given that the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day, we can express this as an exponential function:

Water on Day 1 = 4000 gallons
Water on Day 2 = 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons
Water on Day 3 = 2 * 8000 + 6000 = 16,000 + 6,000 = 22,000 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 22,000 gallons.

Final answer: 22,000"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula for compound interest. In this case, we have an initial population of 10 people, and each person infects 6 others, resulting in a growth rate of 6.

To calculate the total number of people infected after three days, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = total number of people infected after n days
P = initial population (10)
r = growth rate (6/10 or 0.6, since each person infects 6 others)
n = number of days (3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10(1 + 0.6)^3
A = 10(1.6)^3
A = 10 * 4.096
A = 40.96

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

A ≈ 41

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is approximately 41.

"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given away. Since Jennifer gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, we can multiply the number of daughters by the number of oranges each received: 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges. Additionally, she gave 3 oranges to her son. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the total number of oranges Jennifer bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Claire earns 1 badge per month, and Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire's badges per year: 1 * 12 = 12 badges
Wendy's badges per year: 3 * 12 = 36 badges

Now, let's find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber. We know that Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so she earns 1/2 of a badge per month. In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges.

The difference in badges earned by Wendy and Amber: 36 - 6 = 30 badges

"As a baking expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a precise calculation.

Paige baked 10 loaves of banana bread, with each loaf cut into 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of loaves by the number of slices per loaf: 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for $0.50, we can calculate the total amount raised by multiplying the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic equation. 

We know that the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. If Gretchen has 70 gold coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x. 

The equation can be set up as follows: 
x + 30 = 70 

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
x = 70 - 30 
x = 40 

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins: 
Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) 
Total coins = 110 

The final answer is: 110"
"To calculate the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first determine the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students can be calculated as follows:

Total burritos given to students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10
Total burritos given to students = 500

Next, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos given to the students to find the total number of leftover burritos:

Total leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George
Total leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Total leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is 480."
"To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to first find the number of green and blue cars.

The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x.

Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can express Anne's books as x - 12. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie's books can be represented as (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13.

The total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and multiply it by the price per box.

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed by dividing the total cups needed by 10.

Number of boxes needed: 120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Now, we can multiply the number of boxes needed by the price per box to find the total cost.

"To determine Keenan's weekly grocery expenditure, we need to calculate his monthly expenditure first. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find Keenan's monthly expenditure, we multiply the total expenditure by 0.4 (which represents 40%):

$400 * 0.4 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4 to find his weekly expenditure:

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

The final answer is $40."
"To calculate the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to break down his consumption over the three days.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find this, we multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = 24

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find this, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"
"To calculate the total cost of the items David wants to buy, we need to multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle.

"To calculate the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Bolts * Cost per Bolt
Total Cost = 16 * $0.03
Total Cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining Amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"As a canine behaviorist, I can provide a straightforward calculation to determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking.

To find Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the hourly rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings:

Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles. This can be represented as:

Initial marbles + marbles given by friend = Total marbles
52 + 28 = 80

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total marbles, which can be calculated as:

1/4 × 80 = 20

Since Paul lost 1/4 of his marbles, we subtract the lost marbles from the total:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to consider the weighted points for each type of question. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, while the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions are 8.

Next, we calculate the points from the true/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points. Again, each true/false question is worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions are also 18.

Lastly, we calculate the points from the long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions are 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we can use the formula:

Cost Price = Selling Price - Profit

Given that Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of 300 chickens at $50 each and wants to make a profit of $2000, we can calculate the total selling price as:

Total Selling Price = (3/5) * 300 * $50
= 180 * $50
= $9000

Now, we can find the cost price by subtracting the desired profit:

Cost Price = Total Selling Price - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3 to find the number of glasses each person sold.

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

To find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:

14 glasses - 10.67 glasses = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. Since her age will be thrice her present age in a certain number of years, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 3x

where 'y' is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 2x

Since Melanie's present age is 8 years, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

y = 2(8)
y = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the total runtime of the final concert as 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime without the encore is 2x - 15. Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x - 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can add 15 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 + 15
2x = 80

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 40 minutes.

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total number of plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) * 100 = 25

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants. This is done by subtracting the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Now, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants. This can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 75 = 50

Finally, we find the number of flowering plants by subtracting the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To express this as a percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"The problem at hand involves determining the speed of a whirligig based on its relationship to the speed of a thingamabob. As a specialist in kinematics, I'll apply the principles of relative motion to solve this problem.

Let's denote the speed of the thingamabob as x meters per second. Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, its speed can be expressed as 11x meters per second. We're given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

11x = 121

To solve for x, we'll divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

Now that we know the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find the speed of the whirligig, which spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob. The speed of the whirligig is:

Speed of whirligig = 5x

Weekly earnings = $12 * 8 * 5
Weekly earnings = $480

Therefore, Mark makes $480 per week."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to analyze the given information. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The amount she earned from mowing lawns can be calculated by considering the number of times she mowed each lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We can set up the equation: 6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:
x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:

"To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many notebooks Joseph had initially. Since Martha had 7 notebooks and she had 3 times as many as Joseph, we can set up an equation:

Let's say Joseph had x notebooks.
Martha had 3x notebooks.

Since Martha had 7 notebooks, we can set up the equation:
3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:
x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

So Joseph had approximately 2.33 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:
7 - 2.33 = 4.67

Therefore, Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can represent Anis' distance as 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 times Dijana's distance.

Let's denote Dijana's distance as x. Then, Anis' distance can be represented as (6/5)x.

We know that Dijana's distance is 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis' distance:
Anis' distance = (6/5)x
Anis' distance = (6/5)(50)
Anis' distance = 60

To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we can add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 + 60
Total distance = 110

The final answer is: 110"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. Since the cookies are being divided equally, we can use the division operation.

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies ÷ Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 ÷ 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. This indicates a difference of 13 - 10 = 3 pages in favor of Daniel.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than the number of pages Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find the difference in the total number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we need to calculate the total pages read by both of them. Yesterday, they read 10 + 13 = 23 pages. Today, Denise read 18 pages. So, the total pages read by both of them is 23 + 18 = 41 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 41 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. So, Denise read 41 - 23 = 18 more pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"

"To calculate the total material needed for the face masks, we need to determine the amount required for both small and large masks separately.

For small masks, we know that 4 small masks can be made from 2 yards of material. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

20 small masks / 4 small masks per 2 yards = x yards
20 / 4 = x / 2
x = 20 * 2 / 4
x = 10 yards

For large masks, we know that 3 large masks can be made from 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

8 large masks / 3 large masks per 2.25 yards = x yards
8 / 3 = x / 2.25
x = 8 * 2.25 / 3
x = 6 yards

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"

"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the marbles he gave away and subtract that from his initial amount.

Dean initially has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is equivalent to 6 marbles (1/5 * 30 = 6). Additionally, he gives 10 marbles to Donald.

The total marbles given away is 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"As a packaging expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Colby's earnings.

To calculate Colby's daily earnings, we need to first determine the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate this as follows:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10 = 40

Since Colby works for 8 hours, the total number of packages he completes in a day is:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
= 40 * 8
= 320

Given that Colby earns $0.20 for every package, his daily earnings can be calculated as:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * Package rate
= 320 * $0.20
= $64

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate the total number of bottles John drinks, we need to determine the total time spent on sudoku puzzles and then divide it by the time interval between each bottle.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

However, since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of red balloons as R and the number of yellow balloons as Y. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that the total number of bologna pieces thrown is 58 and the number of red balloons is 20.

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:

2R + 3Y = 58

We are also given that R = 20. We can substitute this value into the equation:

2(20) + 3Y = 58

Simplifying the equation, we get:

40 + 3Y = 58

Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get:

3Y = 18

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Y = 6

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

The final answer is 6."
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can calculate the total miles driven in 30 days and then divide by the interval at which the tune-ups are required.

Jon drives 100 miles per day, so in 30 days, he drives a total of:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the tune-ups are required every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To calculate the total hours worked by Bruce, we can break down the hours worked each day:

Tuesday: 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide it by 2.

The total amount spent on the cake is $11. The cost of 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6. The total amount spent on the cake and balloons is $11 + $6 = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14. The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2

x = 15.5

The amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them is $15.50."
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left, we need to consider the initial quantities of each fruit and subtract the number eaten by Lola.

Kira initially bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. To find the total, we add these quantities:

3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total:

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, which is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The number of students playing soccer is given as 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students in each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

The final answer is 56."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to consider the number of lollipops sold and the profit per lollipop.

The cost price of each lollipop is $0.5, and the selling price is $0.8. The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost price.

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

The total number of lollipops sold is 30 students * 10 lollipops per student = 300 lollipops.

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each one.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, which is 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're told he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7.

The fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21.

Lastly, the collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, which is 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can use the formula for calculating the total number of months she has been collecting shells:

Total months = (Current age - Starting age) * 12

In this case, Martha is 10 years old and started collecting shells at 5 years old. Plugging in the values, we get:

Total months = (10 - 5) * 12
Total months = 5 * 12
Total months = 60

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months:

Total shells = Total months
Total shells = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the time constraint. The sloth has 8 hours to collect 24 berries. Since it takes 4 hours for the sloth to make a round trip, we can calculate the number of trips he can make in 8 hours.

Let's denote the number of berries picked per trip as 'x'. The total number of berries collected in 8 hours is 24. Since the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours, we can set up the equation:

2x = 24

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the net change in the tank's water level over 6 days. 

The tank is initially filled with 5000 gallons of water. The pump empties the tank at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

The net change in the tank's water level can be calculated as follows:

Net change = Initial water - (Emptying rate * Number of days)
= 5000 - (500 * 6)
= 5000 - 3000
= 2000 gallons

The final amount of water in the tank after 6 days will be 2000 gallons.

The final answer is: $oxed{2000}$"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses to determine how many movies he can see.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"As a pastry nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the calorie content of the pastries Andrew baked.

To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to consider the calorie reduction for each type of pastry. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each type of pastry as follows:

Mini Cinnamon Roll: 600 / 3 = 200 calories
Mini Blueberry Muffin: 450 / 3 = 150 calories

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls x 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins x 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

Therefore, the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000.

Final Answer: The final answer is 85,000."
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus's speed is 60 miles per hour, and it traveled for 5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance the bus traveled:

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car's speed is 30 miles per hour, and it traveled for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance the car traveled:

Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 
Blocks = 31
Stuffed animals = 8
Rings = 9

Total initial toys = Blocks + Stuffed animals + Rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Since Sophie now has a total of 62 toys, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total initial toys from the current total:
Bouncy balls = Total current toys - Total initial toys
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"The problem at hand is a classic example of a linear equation system. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We can represent their ages as variables: P for Peter, P + 10 for Paul, and J for Jean. 

We can write the equation for their combined age as: P + (P + 10) + J = 100.

Since we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age, we can write another equation: P = (P + 10) + J.

Now, let's simplify the first equation by combining like terms: P + P + 10 + J = 100, which simplifies to 2P + J + 10 = 100.

Subtract 10 from both sides: 2P + J = 90.

We can also simplify the second equation: P = (P + 10) + J, which simplifies to P = P + 10 + J. Subtracting P from both sides gives us 0 = 10 + J, and then subtracting 10 from both sides gives us -10 = J.

Now that we have J, we can substitute J = -10 into the equation 2P + J = 90: 2P - 10 = 90.

Add 10 to both sides: 2P = 100.

Divide both sides by 2: P = 50.

Therefore, Peter's age is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 water balloons each. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of balloons is:

5 people * 2 balloons/person = 10 balloons

Maria also had 1 balloon for herself, so the total number of balloons becomes:

10 balloons + 1 balloon = 11 balloons

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:

5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Adding the initial 11 balloons to the additional 15 balloons, the total number of balloons is:

11 balloons + 15 balloons = 26 balloons

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the required number of tables by dividing the total number of boxes by 2.

Number of tables needed = Total boxes / 2
= 60 boxes / 2
= 30 tables

As the charity group already has 15 tables, we can find the number of new tables required by subtracting the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed = Total tables needed - Existing tables
= 30 tables - 15 tables
= 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated and existing items."
"To determine the average total distance spat, we need to calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney, then divide by 2.

Zoey's total distance spat is 40 seeds * 10 feet = 400 feet. 
Sydney's total distance spat is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"As a financial analyst specializing in widget production and sales, I've crunched the numbers to determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000.

To calculate the total revenue from each machine, we need to consider the number of widgets produced and the selling price of each widget. Assuming a constant production rate and selling price, we can use the following formulas:

Revenue = Number of widgets * Selling price

For the Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in total revenue, we subtract the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can calculate the amount of hay each animal requires and then sum them together.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which is 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"Let's break down John's financial situation step by step.

First, we calculate John's total earnings: 50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars.

"As a plumbing expert, I can confidently calculate the total cost of the job. To determine the total cost, we need to consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts.

The fixed charge is $40, and the labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). This gives us:

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The total cost of parts is $60.

To find the total cost, we add the labor cost, the fixed charge, and the cost of parts:

Total cost = Labor cost + Fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

The final answer is: $178.75"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially purchased 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of $150. Since he received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

The total cost after the discount is:

Total cost after discount = Total cost of CDs - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $150 - $60
Total cost after discount = $90

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of:

Total revenue from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total revenue from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total revenue from selling CDs = $200

To determine how much James was out, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost after the discount:

Amount James was out = Total cost after discount - Total revenue from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $90 - $200
Amount James was out = -$110

Since James was out $110, he actually lost $110.

Final answer: $110"

"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be represented as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a loaf, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we are looking for the number of loaves the bakery has, which is 7 times the number of loaves Sam had plus 40. 

The bakery has 7 * 15 = 105 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"

The commission for the New York Times is 10% of the cost of each copy, which is 6 copies * $5 * 0.1 = $3.

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is 8% of the cost of each copy, which is 10 copies * $15 * 0.08 = $12.

To find the total commission, we add the commissions for both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we can use the information provided. Since Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus's age can be calculated as:

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

As Marcus is half of Leo's age, we can set up the equation:

Marcus's age = (1/2) * Leo's age
21 = (1/2) * Leo's age

To solve for Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Leo's age = 21 * 2
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can represent Bahati's score as (x + 20). We know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can also represent Bahati's score as (x + 10).

We are given that the total points scored by all three is 45. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3

x = 18.33

Since we cannot have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the exact value of x as a fraction.

Now, we can find Azibo's score by substituting the value of x into the expression (x + 10):

Azibo's score = (18.33 + 10)
= 28.33

However, since we are dealing with whole points, we can express Azibo's score as a whole number. We can round down to the nearest whole number, but in this case, we can express the exact value of Azibo's score as a fraction.

Azibo's score = (55/3) + 10
= (55 + 30)/3
= 85/3

To convert this to a whole number, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3 and then divide by 3:

Azibo's score = 85/3
= 85 ÷ 3
= 28.33

Since we are dealing with whole points, we can express Azibo's score as a whole number.

Azibo's score = 28

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the given information that the book is 1.5 inches thick and the paper is 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Let's calculate the total number of pages in the book:

Number of pages per inch = 2
Thickness of the book = 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
= 2 * 1.5
= 3

Therefore, the book contains 3 pages."
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we need to determine the total minutes he worked and then divide that by the time interval at which he staples reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 15 hours by 60.

Total minutes = 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

Kim's usual sleep duration is 8 hours, which is equivalent to 480 minutes. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept:

480 - 5 = 475 minutes

Additionally, she woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:

475 + 23 = 498 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept for 498 minutes on her bed that day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{498}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to calculate the number of measuring spoons he has after gifting Pedro 6 spoons. 

Jonathan initially has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

2/3 * 2 dozen = 2/3 * 24 = (2 * 24) / 3 = 48 / 3 = 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to consider the initial capacity and the daily admissions.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied, which equals 100 beds. This leaves 900 unoccupied beds initially.

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the number of unoccupied beds decreases by 50 per day. Over 14 days, the total decrease in unoccupied beds is:
50 patients/day x 14 days = 700 patients

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
900 - 700 = 200 beds

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of non-work emails:
Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family:
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we find the number of emails to her boyfriend:
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can use the given information. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna's age can be calculated as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5:

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

Let's calculate 20% of 48:
0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To determine the total number of basketballs, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls = 2x. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2(2x) = 4x.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 1.

Now, we can find the total number of balls by adding the balls carried by each boy: Total balls = Jason's balls + Jordan's balls + Jeffrey's balls = 2x + 4x + x = 7x.

Substituting x = 1, we get: Total balls = 7(1) = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the number of holes dug by the pirates on the fourth day, given the information about the number of holes dug on previous days and the total number of holes on the fourth day.

Let's analyze the situation:

The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Total holes on the fourth day = 4 * Total holes on the third day
116 = 4 * 29

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we can solve for x:

116 = 4x
x = 116 / 4
x = 29

However, this represents the total number of holes on the fourth day, including the ones dug on the fourth day. To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total number of holes dug on the previous days:

Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes on the fourth day - Total holes on the previous days
= 116 - 29
= 87

Therefore, the number of holes dug by the pirates on the fourth day is 87.

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we can use the information given. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the others got as x. Then, Collins got x + 15. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + (x + 15) = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 155 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 77.5. However, since we can't have half a corn chip, this is an issue. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the information. If Collins got 15 more than the others, and Amora and Lainey got 70 each, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15 = 85. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + 85 = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 225 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 75. This is a valid solution, as it represents a whole number of corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is 3x, which is 3 * 75 = 225.

The final answer is 225."
"To calculate the cost of the travel, we need to determine 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply by 0.5.

50% of $400 = 0.5 x $400 = $200

The cost of travel is the sum of the cost of supplies and 50% of the cost of supplies.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"The art of Pokémon catching. A most intriguing pursuit, indeed. As a Pokémon researcher specializing in the field of Pokémon dynamics, I've delved into the intricacies of their capture rates and strategies. Now, let's apply my expertise to the given problem.

We're presented with a scenario where Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are attempting to catch Pokémon. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339. We're also given the following information:

1. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
2. Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than four times the number caught by Adelwolfe.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We can represent the given information using the following equations:

A + S + X = 339  ... (Equation 1)
X = S + 5  ... (Equation 2)
S = 4A - 13  ... (Equation 3)

Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1, we get:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substituting Equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.

The final answer is: $\boxed{147}$"
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to calculate the total number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:

Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can multiply the total number of episodes by the length of each episode to find the total time:

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can break down the bird's journey into three segments and calculate the total distance traveled.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first segment is:

d1 = 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second segment is:

d2 = 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third segment is:

d3 = 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net distance traveled south is:

d_net = d1 - d2 = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the net distance traveled south, which is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can represent this as 12.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies at the office party. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1/2 by 12, which equals 6. So, she received 6 brownies at the office party.

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home. Again, 1 dozen equals 12, so 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Now, we add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 to a whole number, we multiply 1 by 12 and add 1/2 * 12, which equals 12 + 6 = 18. So, 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total age of the family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

The cost of the remaining phones (3 phones) is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Therefore, the total cost of the phones is $2100."
"In the context of combinatorics and team composition, we can approach this problem by utilizing basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of players in Carlton's team as C and the number of players in Zeke's team as Z. We are given that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we can express this relationship as:

Z = C + 7

We are also given that Carlton's team has 13 players, so C = 13.

Substituting C = 13 into the equation Z = C + 7, we get:

Z = 13 + 7
Z = 20

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in both teams:

Total players = C + Z
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats needed:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The United States of America has 50 states. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of 50 is 25. Adding 4 to this result yields 29 states in India.

Now, we can calculate the total number of states in both countries by adding the number of states in the USA and India: 50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79.

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the saved amount from the total cost:

$39 - $14 = $25

To find the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage of $5:

Number of hours = $25 / $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we need to consider the sales of gingerbread and apple pie separately.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, so G = 10.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is G + 5. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday, so the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is A - 4.

We are given that the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is 15, so we can set up the equation: G + 5 = 15. Solving for G, we get G = 10, which confirms our initial information.

Now, we can set up an equation for the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday: A - 4 = 6. Solving for A, we get A = 10.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 10 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $150

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $150 = $300

"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, we can multiply the number of hours she will be outside by 1 (since she reappplies 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour).

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours
Total ounces needed = 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle to find the number of bottles she will need:
Number of bottles = Total ounces needed / Ounces per bottle
= 32 ounces / 8 ounces
= 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"As a color connoisseur, I can confidently analyze the given information. The price of the blue car is $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we can calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and subtract it from the price of the blue car.

40% of $100 = 0.4 x $100 = $40

Now, subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
$100 - $40 = $60

Therefore, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Emil is currently 19 years old. We can represent his current age as E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation 24 = D/2, where D represents his dad's age. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation 24 = 2B, where B represents his brother's age. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12. The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12.

Thursday: 3 pounds
Friday: 4 times Thursday's amount = 4 * 3 = 12 pounds
Saturday: half of Friday's amount = 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Total amount of crawfish caught: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings:

21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

The length of the flower bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. We know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so in a week, he eats 18 * 7 = 126 pretzels. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up the proportion:

x / 126 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 126 * 1/2
x = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to multiply the number of baskets by the number of items per basket and then multiply by the cost per item.

The cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
The cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00
The total cost for 5 baskets is 5 * $14.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"As a botanist specializing in horticulture, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the number of roses that can be planted.

To find out how many roses can be planted, we need to first calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.
The total amount of soil used for carnations is 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.

The total amount of soil used for sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.

Since they have 30 pounds of soil, the remaining amount is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses that can be planted is 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of a single pair.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. This can be calculated as:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500 per month

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can divide her monthly savings by the cost of a single pair to find out how many pairs she can buy in a month:

$500 ÷ $1,000 = 0.5 pairs per month

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy per month by 12:

0.5 pairs/month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the task into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the peeling rate:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Peeling rate
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the cooking rate:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Cooking rate
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 30
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 3 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by adding the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to cook:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
Total time = 15 minutes + 3 minutes
Total time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: 18"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we need to consider the net cooling effect of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

Let's calculate the net cooling effect:

Low cooling rate: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees
High cooling rate: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees
Total cooling effect: 6 + 12 = 18 degrees

Since the room warms up at 2 degrees per hour, the net cooling effect is 18 - 2 * 2 = 14 degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(x + 30). Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 30) = 90

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 90 = 90

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill was born by adding 30 to x, which is 30 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(30 + 30) = 3(60) = 180 years old. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet by subtracting 30 from 180, which is 150 years.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he was born by subtracting 30 from 150, which is 120 years.

The final answer is 120."
"As a financial analyst, I've broken down Buford's check-writing habits to provide an accurate calculation.

To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check. 

1. Checks for the electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Checks for the gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Checks to the church: 2 checks per month
4. Checks to the pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Total checks per month: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks
Total checks per year: 4 checks/month * 12 months/year = 48 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 48 checks per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To determine the number of flights to France made by the first plane, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the total number of flights made by the first plane as x. Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the equation:

44 = (1/2)x

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

88 = x

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Since 3/4 of these flights are to Greece, we can calculate the number of flights to Greece as follows:

Flights to Greece = (3/4) * 88
Flights to Greece = 66

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France can be calculated as:

Flights to France = (1/2) * (88 - 66)
Flights to France = (1/2) * 22
Flights to France = 11

The correct answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined length of time for the howls of three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. To approach this, we need to understand the duration of each wolf's howl.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is 2 x 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the combined length of time, we add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know the total age of the children is 20, and the average age is 5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can set up the equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4, respectively. The sum of their ages is 3 + 4 = 7. To find Wilfred's age, we can subtract the sum of Akbar's and Alessandro's ages from the total age:

W = 20 - 7
W = 13

The age of Wilfred is 13."
"As a financial analyst, I can provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.

Walter initially collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, totaling $2000. His lawyer is going to contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. To find the amount his lawyer will contribute, we need to calculate the total amount collected so far and multiply it by 3.

Total amount collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we subtract this amount from the total collected: $2000 - $200 = $1800

Now, we multiply the adjusted total by 3 to find the lawyer's contribution: 3 * $1800 = $5400

However, the problem does not specify that Walter's lawyer will contribute the calculated amount. Instead, it states that Walter will tell his lawyer about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200. This implies that Walter's lawyer will contribute three times the amount Walter has collected so far, not the total amount collected.

Adjusted total for Walter's contribution = $500 + $1500 = $2000

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $2000 = $6000

Since Walter's friend is going to give him $200, we subtract this amount from the adjusted total for Walter's contribution: $2000 - $200 = $1800

Lawyer's contribution = 3 * $1800 = $5400

The final answer is: $5400"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we need to calculate the total number of cookies given to the church and then divide that by the number of cookies each person received.

The bride gave half of the total cookies to the church, which is 1/2 of 1500 cookies. 

Number of cookies given to the church = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To divide a watermelon among a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) such that each adult gets a slice twice as big as that of each kid, we can use the concept of proportional division.

Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x. Since the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"As a medical professional with expertise in scheduling and time management, I can help Doctor Jones optimize his schedule.

To determine the time left for updating records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments. 

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to consider the total time required to complete the process. 

The total time is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes: 180 minutes = 3 hours

Now, we need to subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time. Since the serving time is 5:00 pm, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can use the total number of boxes sold and the total number of chocolate bars sold. 

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. Since Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, the total number of boxes sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars sold can be represented as 8x = 64.

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

8x = 64
x = 64 / 8
x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the weekly cost of students' lessons is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. The monthly cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes, his total number of chocolate bars is 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 ÷ 4
x = 16

Now, let's do the same for Martha. She has 7 boxes, and her total number of chocolate bars is 7x. We know that Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 56

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 56 ÷ 7
x = 8

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each box (x), we can find the difference between Peter's and Martha's boxes:

Difference = Peter's boxes - Martha's boxes
= 16 - 8
= 8

The final answer is: 8"
"As a wildlife biologist specializing in rodent populations, I can provide a detailed analysis of the porcupine population dynamics.

To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the initial population, the birth rate, and the death rate (which is assumed to be negligible in this scenario).

The initial population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be 1490.

Final answer: 1490"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the pool's dimensions: Length = 25 feet, Width = 14 feet, and Depth = 4 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 25 x 14 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next:

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon. To find the total cost, we'll multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon:

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."
"In the context of combinatorics and set theory, let's analyze the problem step by step.

We are given that there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red. This can be represented as:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Additionally, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

To find the total number of sticks, we can simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

For Shandy, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into two categories: students over 16 years old and students under 16 years old.

First, let's calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this category.

Now, we know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. To find the number of male students over 16, we can calculate 1/4 of 1500, which is 1500 / 4 = 375.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so we calculate 1/2 of 1500, which is 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their lap counts.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can express Trey's lap count as 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, we find Shaelyn's lap count by dividing Trey's lap count by 2, resulting in 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Lastly, we calculate Quinn's lap count by subtracting 2 from Shaelyn's lap count, yielding 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, we can find the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts by subtracting Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the remaining amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a linear equation to model the charge remaining in the power bank over time. Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x.

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28% at the end, we can set up an equation:

0.34x = 0.28x + 0.07x

0.34x = 0.35x

This equation also doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine the problem again.

"To calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment, we can use the following formula:

Total Amount / Hourly Wage = Total Hours

First, let's calculate the total amount Janet needs to save:

$10,000 (car price) * 0.20 (20% down payment) = $2,000

Next, we can calculate her total hourly wage:

$10 (wage) + $15 (tips) = $25 (hourly wage)

Now, we can divide the total amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

Final Answer: The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The prices are as follows:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:
3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
4 pears * $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis * $1 = $2
5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent so far = $1.50 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has spent more than he has, we need to recalculate the total amount he has left:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25 (this is not possible, so we will ignore this result)

"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to calculate the total number of pieces given away and then divide it by the number of friends.

First, we find the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs kept from the total number of packs: 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces given away is 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends: 780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"As a seasoned expert in mathematical modeling and analysis, I can confidently calculate the price of carrots after three years, considering the annual increase of 5%.

To find the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final price
P = initial price ($120)
r = annual increase rate (5% or 0.05)
n = number of years (3)

A = 120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = 120(1.05)^3
A = 120(1.157625)
A = 139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can use the information provided. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them into 8 albums. Since the number of pictures per album is the same, we can divide 72 by 8 to find the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The total number of portraits and selfies is the sum of these two values.

27 (selfies) + 18 (portraits) = 45

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use the concept of unit rates. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

Next, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. Therefore, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total number of guests to 91 + 7 = 98.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

The total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can break down the 60-question quiz as follows:

Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36 questions, divided equally between the two = 36 / 2 = 18 questions each

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is:
24 * 0.75 = 18 questions

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is:
18 * 0.5 = 9 questions

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 points

The final answer is 36."
"Let's dive into the world of stuffed animals and pricing. As someone who appreciates the beauty of black, I find the color to be a sophisticated and elegant choice for any stuffed animal.

To solve this problem, we can start by setting up an equation based on the given information. Let's say the price of a large stuffed animal is x. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3x.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * 4 = $12. This means x = 12.

Now, let's say Teresa sold 's' number of large stuffed animals and '2s' number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can multiply the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by 7.

The family consists of 3 individuals: a man, a wife, and a son. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7

The total number of sandwiches eaten in a week is 77.

"To calculate Suzanne's remaining earnings, we need to consider her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from cookies: 80 cookies * $1 per cookie = $80.
Next, we calculate her earnings from cupcakes: 60 cupcakes * $4 per cupcake = $240.

Now, we add her earnings from cookies and cupcakes: $80 + $240 = $320.

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so we subtract the total amount she gave them: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs found by the friends, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we subtract the number of eggs found by the twins (30) from the total number of eggs (100). This leaves us with 70 eggs. 

Since 10 eggs were not found, we can subtract this from the remaining 70 eggs to find the number of eggs found by the friends.

Eggs found by friends = 70 - 10
= 60

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs."
"The art of calculating the total ore mined by a group of dwarves with steel pickaxes is a task that requires a solid understanding of the productivity rates of each tool and the number of workers involved.

To determine the total amount of ore mined in a month, we must first calculate the daily ore production of a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. Given that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands, and 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, we can calculate the daily ore production with a steel pickaxe as follows:

Daily ore production with an iron pickaxe = 12 pounds
Daily ore production with a steel pickaxe = 12 * 1.5 = 18 pounds

Now, we can calculate the daily ore production of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:

Daily ore production of 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes = 40 * 18 pounds = 720 pounds

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply the daily production by 30 days:

Total ore mined in a month = 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21600 pounds

The final answer is: $oxed{21600}$"
"Given the proportional relationship between the package sizes and prices, we can establish a ratio of price to quantity. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. 

To find the price per sandwich, we can calculate the ratio of price to quantity for each package:

Price per sandwich in the first package = $3 / 2 = $1.50
Price per sandwich in the second package = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches:

Price per sandwich = $1.50

Now, we can multiply the price per sandwich by the quantity of the package with 8 sandwiches:

Price of the package with 8 sandwiches = $1.50 * 8
Price of the package with 8 sandwiches = $12

The price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom. This can be done by subtracting the amount received from the initial cost of the bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To determine the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we can break down the problem into steps:

"To calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can use the concept of complementary probability. The probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events:

- The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

The probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework is 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6. To find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: $\boxed{40\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to calculate the remaining seats after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish a relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill Grandpa up, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. This can be expressed as:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Since eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find the number of small beans:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans."
"As a juror compensation expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Melissa's hourly wage after expenses.

To calculate Melissa's hourly wage, we need to first determine her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Daily income: $15 per day

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

"To calculate the remaining amount of money Amor has to buy meat, we need to subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The comforter's dimensions are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

"To determine the share of the first person, let's analyze the situation. We have three people dividing an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's denote the amount the first person took as x. Then, the second person took x + 80, and the third person took 2(x + 80).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760/3

x = 586.67

Since the amount cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the exact amount is not necessary, as the question does not specify whether the shares can be fractional. We can express the share of the first person as a decimal or a whole number.

The final answer is: $586.67"
"To calculate the total hours worked by the team, we need to consider the fractional representation of the days worked. Since the team worked 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks, we can calculate the total hours worked as follows:

First, convert the fractional representation to a decimal: 3/8 = 0.375 days

Now, multiply the decimal representation by the number of days worked (3 weeks = 21 days):
0.375 days * 21 days = 7.875 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we multiply 7.875 days by 24 hours:
7.875 * 24 = 189 hours

To find the hours worked per painter, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4):
189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

The final answer is 47.25."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since he retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

The final answer is: 10"

"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we find the total number of books written in English and German. Since half of the books are written in English, we can calculate this as 50 * 0.5 = 25. Similarly, 10% of the books are written in German, which is 50 * 0.1 = 5.

The total number of books written in English and German is the sum of these two: 25 + 5 = 30.

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the total number of English and German books from the total number of books: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."

"To calculate the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can use the following formula:

Total gallons = Total cups / Cups per gallon

Given that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day, we can multiply the number of cups per day by the number of days:

Total cups = 8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Now, we can divide the total cups by the number of cups per gallon (16) to find the total gallons:

Total gallons = 240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the total number of people on the train at the final stop, we can break down the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and 50 * 2 = 100 people board the train. This results in a total of 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.

At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train, leaving a total of 190 - 80 = 110.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 110.

Final answer: 110"
"To calculate the total cost of the athletic gear, we need to consider the individual costs of each item and apply the relevant discounts.

The tank top costs $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so the cost of the running shorts is $10 + $5 = $15. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but are on sale for half price, so the discounted price is $48 / 2 = $24. The athletic socks originally cost $8 but have a $2 discount, so the final cost is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add the costs together: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

The total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55."

200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"As a financial analyst specializing in insurance policy calculations, I can provide a precise calculation for James' yearly insurance cost.

Given that the normal cost is $120 per month and the accident resulted in a 60% increase, we can calculate the increased cost as follows:

Increased cost = 60% of $120 = 0.6 x $120 = $72

To find the total monthly cost, we add the increased cost to the normal cost:

Total monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192

Since James needs to pay this amount for a month, we multiply it by 12 to find the yearly cost:

Yearly cost = $192 x 12 = $2304

Therefore, James' yearly insurance cost is $2304."
"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week as follows:

Twin loads per week: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
King loads per week: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

To find the total number of loads per week, we divide the total number of loads by 3 (2 twin sets + 1 king set):

Total loads per week = (208 twin loads + 52 king loads) / 3
Total loads per week = (208 + 52) / 3
Total loads per week = 260 / 3
Total loads per week = 86.67 (round up to 87 since you can't do a fraction of a load)

Now, multiply the total loads per week by 52 weeks to find the total number of loads per year:

Total loads per year = 87 * 52
Total loads per year = 4524

The final answer is: 4524"
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends watch in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday and Sunday separately.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. 
On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

Total movies watched on Saturday in 4 weeks = 4 movies/week * 4 weeks = 16 movies
Total movies watched on Sunday in 4 weeks = 2 movies/week * 4 weeks = 8 movies

Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 16 + 8 = 24 movies

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we can break down the information provided:

Initially, Leo had 100 stickers two years ago. Last year, he collected 50 stickers, bringing his total to 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.

This year, Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Adding these to his collection, we get 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo now has 250 stickers in his collection.

The final answer is: $\boxed{250}$"
"To determine the number of days the cat food will last, we can divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily amount (60 grams).

720 grams ÷ 60 grams/day = 12 days

The cat food will last 12 days."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can express Silvia's slices as 2x.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we get:
x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find Silvia's slices:
Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2(7)
Silvia's slices = 14

The total number of slices they ate is the sum of Becky's, Jake's, and Silvia's slices:
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = (7 + 3) + 7 + 14
Total slices = 10 + 7 + 14
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to find the duration of Betsy's part. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the various expenses incurred. 

First, we calculate the cost of the cast: $200.

Next, we determine the cost of the visit. Since the visit is 30 minutes long, we need to convert this to hours. 30 minutes is equivalent to 0.5 hours. The cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.

Lastly, we calculate the cost of parking, which is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, we add these costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

James receives 80 emails per day, and 20% of those emails don't require a response. This means 80 - (20% of 80) = 80 - 0.2 * 80 = 80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 320"
"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can use the following steps:

Let's start by identifying the number of classes that visited each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 2 * 32 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: 3 * 32 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we can add the number of classes that visited each day to find the total:

32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The final answer is: $\boxed{247}$"
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. In this case, we have:

Scores: 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests: 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
= 380 / 4
= 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"As a postal expert, I can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the total number of coupons and determining the total cost of postage.

To find the total number of coupons, we can simply add the number of small coupons and big coupons. Since Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, the total number of big coupons is 700 * 2 = 1400. The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of postage. The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00. The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00. The total cost of postage is $7.00 + $21.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's analyze the situation. Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks carrying 20 tons of fertiliser each. Two hours after departure, it was discovered that a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

To find the number of trucks that couldn't deliver, we calculate a quarter of the total trucks dispatched:

Total trucks dispatched = 20
Trucks that couldn't deliver = 1/4 * 20 = 5

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that couldn't be delivered is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. The number of trucks that delivered is:
20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"To calculate the total cost of the butter, we need to determine the number of pounds Dennis needs and apply the discount.

Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. Therefore, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds.

To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, the total cost will be:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20. 

The total number of guests is 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) - 4 (declined guests) = 41.

Since the initial fee is $125 for 20 guests, we need to calculate the cost for the additional 21 guests. 

The cost for additional guests = 21 * $6 = $126.

Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maggie and Riza each had an equal amount of money, and they spent a portion of it. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 1/4, and Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 1/3.

To find the initial amount of money they had, we can set up an equation. Let's call the initial amount of money they had ""x"". Since they each had the same amount, we can say that Maggie had x and Riza had x.

Maggie spent 1/4 of her money, which is (1/4)x. Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is (1/3)x. The total amount they spent is the sum of these two amounts: (1/4)x + (1/3)x.

Since we know that the total amount they spent is $35, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x + (1/3)x = 35

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12. So we can rewrite the equation as:

(3/12)x + (4/12)x = 35

Combine the fractions:

(7/12)x = 35

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 12/7:

x = 35 * (12/7)

x = 60

So, the initial amount of money they had is $60.

Since they each had $60, and they spent a total of $35, the amount of money they have left is:

$60 - $35 = $25

The two of them have $25 left.

The final answer is $25."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we can start by finding the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week. 

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 10 * 7 = 70 bananas and 14 * 7 = 98 bananas, respectively. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 168 = 147 bananas.

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:
147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to consider the number of pieces he completed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he completed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

The total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

Final answer: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny wants to buy 15 roses. Roses cost $2 each, and a dozen (12) roses cost $15. We can calculate the cost of 15 roses in two ways:

1. 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30
2. 1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since $30 is greater than $18.75, Jenny can't pay with the available money. However, we can calculate the remaining amount she has after buying the roses:

$25 (initial amount) - $30 (cost of roses) = -$5

Since she can't pay with less than $0, we need to recalculate the cost of the roses in terms of dozens:

15 roses / 12 = 1.25 dozen
1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

To find the remaining amount, we can subtract the cost of 1.25 dozen roses from the initial amount:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since she has $6.25 left, we can calculate the number of quarters she can get:

$6.25 / $0.25 (quarter) = 25 quarters

Therefore, Jenny will leave with 25 quarters."
"As a financial analyst specializing in retail sales, I can break down the problem into individual components to calculate the total revenue.

First, let's calculate the revenue from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33.

Next, we'll calculate the revenue from burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99.

Lastly, we'll calculate the revenue from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30.

To find the total revenue, we'll add these amounts together: $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.

"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to analyze the train schedule. 

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we need to calculate the number of toothpicks she still needs to save.

Melanie has saved 120 toothpicks so far, and she needs a total of 200 toothpicks. To find the number of toothpicks she still needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find the number of weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

Final Answer: The final answer is 8."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.

Let's break it down step by step:

Original price = 2000
Sale price = 0.75 * 2000 = 1500

Discount = Original price - Sale price = 2000 - 1500 = 500

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
= (500 / 2000) * 100
= 0.25 * 100
= 25%

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend is 25%.

The final answer is 25."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of jellyfish created by multiple springs working at the same rate. To approach this, we need to consider the rate of jellyfish creation per hour for a single spring and then scale it up to the number of springs and the given time frame.

Given that a new jellyfish is created every second, the rate of jellyfish creation per hour for one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

When 5 springs work at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

To find the total number of jellyfish created in 4 hours, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours: 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

72,000"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can use the given information that his score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. We know Binkie's score is 90.

Let's represent Frankie's score as F and Binkie's score as B. We can set up the equation:

F = 2B + 15

Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To calculate the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

The total distance James walked is 4 miles (2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store.

"To determine the cost-effectiveness of buying bananas in bunches versus individually, we need to consider the total cost of purchasing 10 bunches of bananas.

The cost of buying 10 bunches individually is calculated as follows:

10 bunches * $0.80 per bunch = $8.00

On the other hand, buying 10 bunches at a discounted rate of $3.00 per bunch results in a total cost of:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

Since the result is negative, it means Jenny actually spent more money by buying in bunches instead of individually. However, if we want to find out how much she saved, we can take the absolute value of the result:

$22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as x. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find the amount left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: 80"
"To calculate the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can use the formula for linear growth:

Total growth = growth rate * number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, the growth rate is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"As a bicycle enthusiast and owner of a bicycle store, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
2. The total number of bikes sold is 300, with 150 being Trekking bikes (50% of the total) and 45 being BMX bikes (15% of the total).
3. The remaining bikes are MTB, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105 bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"As a farm management expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a precise calculation.

The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. To find the net change in the number of bales per hour, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made: 5 - 3 = 2 bales per hour.

Since the farmer and the truck driver work for 6 hours, the total net change in the number of bales is 2 * 6 = 12 bales.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to consider his class schedule and additional learning time.

John attends 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. This translates to a daily class time of 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes spent in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Additionally, John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday, which is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

The total minutes spent on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"As a physics enthusiast, I can provide a detailed explanation of the bouncing ball scenario.

When a ball bounces, its height is determined by the equation:

h = h0 * (2/3)^(n)

where h is the height of the ball after the nth bounce, h0 is the initial height, and n is the number of bounces.

In this case, the initial height (h0) is 3 stories, which is equivalent to 72 feet (3 * 24 feet per story). We want to find the height of the ball after the second bounce (n = 2).

Plugging in the values, we get:

h = 72 * (2/3)^(2)
h = 72 * (4/9)
h = 32 feet

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

The final answer is 32."
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know the height of the first child is 6 feet, which is equivalent to 72 inches. 

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we can use the formula:

Total Earnings = Number of Bags Sold * Price per Bag

Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

Number of Bags Sold = Total Apples Sold / Apples per Bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

Total Earnings = Number of Bags Sold * Price per Bag
= 200 bags * $5 per bag
= $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000."
"As a paleontologist specializing in Mesozoic-era carnivores, I can provide a detailed analysis of the scenario.

To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. Let's denote the initial amount of meat as 'x'. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) ate, which means the T-Rex ate half of the initial amount, leaving x/2 kilograms for the velociraptors. The Allosaurus then ate 270 kilograms of this remaining amount.

We can set up the equation: x/2 = 270 + 270 (since the velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate)

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 2: x = 2 * 540

x = 1080

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 1080"
"To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans available.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 11 sodas left. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas.

The friend can choose from the remaining 7 cans (2 shaken + 5 unshaken). The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/7) * 100 = 28.57%

The final answer is: $\boxed{28.57\%}$"
"When two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, their relative motion can be calculated using the concept of relative velocity. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their velocities to find the relative velocity.

Let's denote the velocity of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the velocity of the second train as v2 = 30 miles per hour. The relative velocity (v_rel) is the sum of their velocities:
v_rel = v1 + v2 = 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we multiply the relative velocity by the time:
Distance = v_rel * time = 90 miles/hour * 3 hours = 270 miles

Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To calculate the total number of people Billy can help, we need to determine the number of days he is available to volunteer and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

Final answer: 150"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

The number of people in buses can be calculated by multiplying the number of buses by the number of people each bus can carry. In this case, there are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people.

Number of people in buses = 12 * 35
= 420

Similarly, the number of people in cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the number of people each car can carry. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people.

Number of people in cars = 20 * 3
= 60

The total number of people inside the church is the sum of the number of people in buses and the number of people in cars.

Total number of people = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
= 420 + 60
= 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can analyze the given information:

Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

The final answer is 30."
"As a waterpark enthusiast and expert in the field of water slide dynamics, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the time difference between the two slides.

To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed. 

For the biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
For the second biggest slide: Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

To find the difference in time, subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

The biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest waterslide.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"As a time management expert, I can analyze Bobby's daily routine to determine the total time spent on his lunch and breaks.

Bobby's daily routine consists of a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks, which equals a total of 60 minutes per day. To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we can multiply the total time per day by 5:

1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over a 5-day period.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the distance Ahito ran, we can use the information provided. We know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. 

Let's calculate Micah's distance: 
Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance 
Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. We already know that Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles together. 

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance run by all three. 
Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance) 
Ahito's distance = 52 - 36 
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item.

The frying pan was originally priced at $20.00 and had a 20% discount. The discount amount is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

The set of towels was originally priced at $30.00 and had a 10% discount. The discount amount is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the items purchased is $15.00 (returned item) + $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $58.00.

Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card. The new balance will be $85.00 - $15.00 (returned item) = $70.00. Then, $70.00 + $58.00 (new purchases) = $128.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $128.00."
"To solve this problem, we can use the information given to set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x.

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. A third of these large jellyfish change color, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5)/3 = x/15.

The remaining jellyfish are small and stay blue. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color, which means the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6. This allows us to set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We know:

1. C = 4 (Chris is 4 years old)
2. B = 2C (Ben is two times older than Chris)
3. A = 3B (Caroline is three times older than Ben)

We can substitute the value of B from equation (2) into equation (3):

A = 3(2C)
A = 6C

Now, substitute the value of C from equation (1):

A = 6(4)
A = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"I'll provide a revised response.

Lauren's situation seems to be a classic example of a savings problem. To determine how many more years she needs to work, we need to calculate her annual savings and annual expenses.

Let's assume Lauren saves 20% of her income, which is $20,000 per year (0.20 * $100,000). Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year.

The amount she saves each year is $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000. However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses.

To calculate the number of years she needs to work, we can divide her annual expenses by her annual savings. However, since her annual savings is negative, we need to re-evaluate the question.

Assuming the question meant to say she saves 20% of her income, not 20% of her expenses, let's recalculate:

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Annual expenses = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Annual savings = $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 per year.

Annual savings = $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 per year.

This is still a negative number. Let's re-evaluate the question again.

Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year.

Annual expenses = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000 per year.

Annual savings = $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 per year.

"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of division. We start by dividing the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This can be represented as:

100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm per part

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be divided into (5). This can be represented as:

25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To determine the total number of girls in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as x. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we can subtract this from the required daily amount to find the additional miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: $\boxed{185}$"

"To determine the cost of each book, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each book as 'x'. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x. We know that the total amount she had initially was $16, and she spent $4 initially, leaving her with $12. After buying the books, she had $2 left. This means the cost of the books is equal to the difference between the amount she had initially and the amount she had after buying the books: 12 - 2 = 10. 

So, we can set up the equation: 2x = 10. To find the cost of each book, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 10 / 2.

x = 5

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New value = Old value + (Old value * Percentage increase)

In this case, the old value is 50 students, and the percentage increase is 20%. We can plug these values into the formula:

New value = 50 + (50 * 0.20)
New value = 50 + 10
New value = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the concept of rate and proportion. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Let x be the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We can set up the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

255x = 459 * 5

Simplifying, we get:

255x = 2295

Dividing both sides by 255, we get:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9.05 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.05 minutes to blink 459 times."
"Let's analyze the situation. Tate initially had 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. He then bought 2 male guppies, 1 female guppy, 2 male goldfishes, and 3 female goldfishes.

To find the total number of male and female fish, we need to add the initial number of fish and the number of fish Tate bought.

Initial male guppies: 4
Initial female guppies: 7
Initial male goldfishes: 3
Initial female goldfishes: 5

Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the difference between the total number of female fish and male fish:
Total female fish: 8 + 8 = 16
Total male fish: 6 + 5 = 11

The difference between the total number of female fish and male fish is 16 - 11 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total time, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. This is a straightforward task, and I can confidently say that 4 hours is a reasonable amount of time for lawn mowing.

Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. This implies that Dior took 4 + some amount of time greater than 4 hours. Since we know that 4 hours is the minimum time Amalia took, and Dior took over 4 hours longer, we can say that Dior took at least 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To calculate the total distance driven in a month, we need to consider the round trip distance. The distance to his parents is 2 hours * 70 mph = 140 miles. Since it's a round trip, the total distance is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Since he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{560}$"
"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can use the information that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian. 

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as x. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x. We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she walks 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

We can set up the equation 2x = 70 to represent the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian. Solving for x, we get x = 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to analyze the production capacity of the first four workers and the total number of toys required to fulfill the order.

Let's denote the production rate of the fifth worker as x toys per hour. The total production capacity of the first four workers is 2 * 6 + 2 * 4 = 20 toys per hour. Since the order requires 400 toys, and the first four workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we can divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (200) by the number of hours worked (10):

x = 200 / 10
x = 20 toys per hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 
Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.
Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add the weights of both dogs: 
15 + 30 = 45 pounds

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 45 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide it by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight of M&M's is:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Given that an ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is:

30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag (10) to find the number of small bags:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
= 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
= 90 small bags

"As a car enthusiast and a black car aficionado, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the speed of the fastest car.

Let's break down the information given:

1. The average car's speed is 120 mph.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
3. The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

To find the speed of the faster car, we can follow these steps:

Let x be the speed of the average car.
The speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5x
The speed of the faster car = 1.25 * (5x) = 6.25x

Since we know the speed of the average car (x = 120 mph), we can substitute this value into the equation:
Speed of the faster car = 6.25 * 120
Speed of the faster car = 750 mph

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'x'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'x - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We can set up the equation:

2(x - 2) = 14

Expanding the equation, we get:

2x - 4 = 14

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

2x = 18

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 Easter eggs. We also know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. Since A = M, we can write A = M.

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. We can write this as C + S = 30 and C = S + 12.

Since C = S + 12, we can substitute this into the equation C + S = 30, which gives us (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Solving for S, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, which gives us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

We know that A = M, and we also know that A + M + C + S = 56. Substituting the values we found for C and S, we get A + A + 21 + 9 = 56.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 30 = 56. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2A = 26. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 13.

Now that we know A = 13, we can find the difference between the number of eggs Camden painted and Arnold painted. This is C - A = 21 - 13 = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Total number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:
Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:
Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:
Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

Final answer: 25"
"To calculate the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to consider the percentage of the tree that can be converted into logs and then into planks.

First, we find the total length of logs John can make: 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length by the log length to get the number of logs: 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Next, we calculate the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5: 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes: 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To determine the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salaries.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. Since her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, his monthly salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, so we first need to find their combined salary: $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000. Then, their mother's salary is 2 * $15,000 = $30,000.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"As a pedestrian dynamics expert, I can analyze the problem and provide a solution.

Grandma's walking speed on the beach is a constant value, denoted as 'b' miles per minute. Her walking speed on the sidewalk is twice that value, so it is 2b miles per minute.

We know that 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, covering a distance of 2 miles. We can set up the equation:

40b = 2

To find the value of 'b', we can divide both sides by 40:

b = 2/40
b = 1/20 miles per minute

Now, we can find the time it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 / (2b)
Time = 1 / (2 * (1/20))
Time = 1 / (1/10)
Time = 10 minutes

Since the total walk consists of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, we can add the time it takes for each part:

Total Time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total Time = 40 minutes + 10 minutes
Total Time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: 50"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of simple interest. Since she saves $4 per week, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save $60.

The total amount saved is the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
4x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 60 ÷ 4
x = 15

Therefore, it will take Jane 15 weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 15"
"To calculate the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can use the following formula:

Total blue birds = (Number of trees with 7 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree) + (Number of trees with 4 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree) + (Number of trees with 3 blue birds * Number of blue birds per tree)

Total blue birds = (3 * 7) + (2 * 4) + (1 * 3)
Total blue birds = 21 + 8 + 3
Total blue birds = 32

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

We can set up the equation: x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce. The total amount of water is 5 ounces, so the amount of water in the other mug is 5 - 4 = 1 ounce.

We can set up the following equation based on the temperature of the water:

(4/5) * 33 + (1/5) * x = 40

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

4 * 33 + x = 200

132 + x = 200

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

x = 68

Therefore, the temperature of the second mug is at least 68 degrees.

Final answer: 68"
"As an animal husbandry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the farm's growth.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. To calculate the total number of animals after three weeks, we need to consider the daily and weekly growth.

Daily growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day

Weekly growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week

Total growth in 3 weeks:
- Cows: 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows
- Chickens: 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (growth) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (growth) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

"As a bagel connoisseur, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the cost of each bagel.

To find the cost of each bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by the total number of bagels. 

The total cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. There are 9 bagels in each pack, so we divide the total cost by 9.
$36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 5 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 5 scoops.
1.5 potatoes/scoop * 5 scoops = 7.5 potatoes

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate.
7.5 potatoes - 5 scoops = 2.5 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break it down into two periods: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he eats 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he eats 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

The total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.

Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs, we can divide 240 by 12 to find the number of dozens of eggs:

240 ÷ 12 = 20

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of blue jellybeans as B, the number of green jellybeans as G, and the number of red jellybeans as R.

We know that G = 17 and R = 2G. Since the total number of jellybeans is 60, we can set up the equation:

B + G + R = 60

Substituting R = 2G, we get:

B + G + 2G = 60
B + 3G = 60

We also know that G = 17, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

B + 3(17) = 60
B + 51 = 60

Now, we can solve for B:

B = 60 - 51
B = 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."
"To calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we can use the formula:

Total lemons = Number of trees * Number of lemons per tree * Number of years

Given:
Number of trees = 5
Number of lemons per tree = 6

Total lemons = 5 * 6 * 10
Total lemons = 300

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We are told that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the value of one part: 5/14 = x/84, where x is the value of one part. Solving for x, we get x = 84/14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54. This represents the initial number of women on the bus.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of sunflowers sold. The total earnings from sunflowers is $2x, and the total earnings from bouquets is $56. We know that the total earnings is $26 + $56 = $82. So, we can set up the equation:

2x + 56 = 82

Subtracting 56 from both sides gives us:

2x = 26

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 13

Since x represents the number of sunflowers sold, we can conclude that Faraday sold 13 sunflowers.

However, we also know that each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, and Faraday sold 7 bouquets. To find the total number of sunflowers sold, we can multiply the number of bouquets by 12:

7 * 12 = 84

So, Faraday sold a total of 84 sunflowers.

Final answer: 84"
"Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, how much money does he lose?

To find the amount of money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as the revenue is less than the cost. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Since Adam can't sell all his rocks, let's assume he sells 0.6x rocks and keeps the remaining 0.4x rocks.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The cost of the rocks is $5x, and the cost of the remaining 0.4x rocks is 0.4x * 5 = $2x.

The total cost is $5x + $2x = $7x.

"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

Since there are 4 children, we can divide the total number of eggs by 4 to find the number of eggs each child receives.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Therefore, each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to consider the daily cost of food per fish and the number of days in the month.

Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and there are 31 days in May, we can multiply the daily cost by the number of days to find the total cost.

Total cost = Daily cost per fish * Number of days in May
Total cost = $1 * 31
Total cost = $31

Therefore, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can apply basic arithmetic operations.

Patricia initially had 30 roses. She then gave away 24 roses to her mother. To find the remaining number of roses, we subtract the number of roses given away from the initial number:

30 - 24 = 6

Next, Patricia bought 15 more roses. To find the total number of roses she has now, we add the number of roses she bought to the remaining number of roses:

6 + 15 = 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time.

Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, we can find the total distance and total time.

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 250 miles / 5 hours
= 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"In probability theory, when two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. In this case, we have two independent events: the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, and the second ticket is three times more likely to win, with a probability of 0.6.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Carlos collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Jim collected. Let's represent the number of seashells Jim collected as x. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Now, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's represent the number of seashells Carrey collected as y. Then, we can set up an equation:

x = 2y

Substituting x = 22, we get:

22 = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 11

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells.

The total number of seashells is the sum of what each person collected:

Total = x + y + 27
= 22 + 11 + 27
= 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got:

60 / 3
= 20

The final answer is: 20"
"As a nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Mason's carrot consumption.

To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to consider his daily intake on weekdays and the weekend. 

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 weekend days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Now, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To calculate the total time of the cassette, we need to determine the length of the second song. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The length of the second song is then x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

We know the length of the first song is 5 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1.6x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.6:

x = 5 / 1.6
x = 3.125

Now that we know the length of the first song, we can find the length of the second song:

Length of the second song = 1.6x
= 1.6 * 3.125
= 5 + 3
= 8

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 + 8
= 13 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"As a financial analyst specializing in profit calculations, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

The cost of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $40.
The cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $80.
The total cost is $40 + $80 = $120.

The selling price of 2 devices bought on Monday is 2 * (2 * $20) = 2 * $40 = $80.
The selling price of 4 devices bought on Tuesday is 4 * (2 * $20) = 4 * $40 = $160.
The total selling price is $80 + $160 = $240.

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate the height of her brother, Ned, by subtracting 2 feet from Isabel's height. This results in Ned being 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.

Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height can be calculated as 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

As Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, the length of the cane can be determined by dividing Carl's height by 2. This gives us 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people is:

Total bottles needed = 2300 * 100% / 20%
Total bottles needed = 2300 * 5
Total bottles needed = 11500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles.

Number of days = Total bottles needed / Bottles produced per day
Number of days = 11500 / 4200
Number of days = 2.74

Since we can't produce a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of days = 3

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce per day to meet the demand.

"To calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the number of babies wearing purple and the number of babies wearing bows.

Let's assume there are 8 babies (since it's an octuplet).

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2

Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Now, we can find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 6 / (6 + 2)
= 6 / 8
= 3/4
= 0.75

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
Probability = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%.

The final answer is 75%."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can use a simple subtraction approach. Let's break down the information:

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

Since the reports received on Wednesday are not explicitly stated, we can find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then subtract that from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, subtract this total from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To calculate Abraham's total earnings from selling his unused land, we need to break down the transactions.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = $25 per square meter. Since he sold 40 square meters, his earnings from this transaction are 40 * $25 = $1000.

He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. Since he sold 20 square meters, his earnings from this transaction are 20 * $30 = $600.

Abraham has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

Abraham initially sold 40 + 20 = 60 square meters of land for $1000 + $600 = $1600. He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $60. So, in total, he earned $1600 + $60 = $1660.

The final answer is: $1660"
"To determine Geb's age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Haley's age as 'H' and Geb's age as 'G'. According to the problem, Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. This can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final answer: 3"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Tyrion's face mask usage can be calculated by multiplying the number of times he changes his mask per day (2) by the number of times he goes out per day (3). This gives us a daily usage of 2 * 3 = 6 face masks.

To find the total number of face masks used every 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2. This results in 6 * 2 = 12 face masks.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to first find the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"Avocado Tree Fruit Production Calculation

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern of the tree. The problem states that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.

Let's break down the production pattern:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

The total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 52500."

"The problem at hand involves determining the length of the red rope, given that it is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. We can approach this problem by setting up a system of equations.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. We know that B = Y - 7 and R = 4B. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we can start by recognizing that the mural is divided into four sections: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. The amount of yellow paint is also 'x', as half the mural is yellow.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total area of Tom's house, we need to determine the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"Cloud Counting Problem

As a cloud enthusiast and expert in atmospheric science, I can provide a detailed analysis of the cloud counting problem. Given that Alice counts the puffs of clouds in the sky while eating her lunch outside at school, we can model the number of clouds for each day as follows:

On Monday, she counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days, we can add the number of clouds from each day:

3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To determine the number of cycles you can run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. 
Cost per pod = Total cost / Total pods = $12 / 120 pods = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod to find the number of cycles: 
$1 / $0.1 per pod = 10 cycles.

Therefore, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 40 bills. Half of the remaining bills are used to pay for a bill, which is 20 bills. After tripling his money, he now has 60 bills. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.

To find the total number of 5 dollar bills, we multiply the total number of bills by 5.

"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to analyze the scoring patterns of both teams.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can set up an equation based on the rate at which he uses the chalk.

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as x. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can express the remaining chalk after x days as:

L - 0.20x

We know that the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, so we can set up the following inequality:

L - 0.20x ≥ 2

We also know that the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is equivalent to 0.45L. Since he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can set up the equation:

0.45L = 2.25

Solving for L, we get:

L = 2.25 / 0.45
L = 5

Now we can substitute L into the inequality:

5 - 0.20x ≥ 2

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

0.80x ≥ 3

Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get:

x ≥ 3.75

Since x represents the number of days, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the teacher will use up the remaining chalk in 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity is the difference between the total number of students and the total number of students on varsity, which is 24 - 7 = 17.

2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, the cost of the returned milk would be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information.

Let W be Wendy's current age and C be Colin's current age. From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000.

First, we'll divide the total amount by the cost of one set of 100 books: $27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets.

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of sets by 3: 54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school.

Now, we'll multiply the number of sets per school by 100 to find the total number of books per school: 18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school.

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: 1800"
"The problem at hand involves a sequence of events where apples are picked, thrown, and then fall out of a tree. To determine the total number of apples brought home, we can analyze the situation step by step.

Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples. Then, he put 1 apple in his pocket and threw 1 apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. This results in a total of 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.

Next, he put all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left. He then threw 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. This brings the total to 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Since Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home, the total number of apples he brought home is 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Total Weight of Coal / Weight per Bag) * Cost per Bag

Given:
Total Weight of Coal = 850 kg
Weight per Bag = 50 kg
Cost per Bag = $18

Total Cost = (850 kg / 50 kg) * $18
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices eaten by her friends and then divide that by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The cheese pizza has 12 slices, and the pepperoni pizza has 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (12 + 8 = 20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we can use the following formula:

Total miles = (Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + (Miles on Tuesday and Thursday)
Total miles = (3 miles * 3 days) + (5 miles * 2 days)
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles
Total miles = 19 miles

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to consider the net rate at which he builds snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour but loses 2 every 15 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour. Since there are 4 15-minute intervals in an hour, 2 * 4 = 8 snowballs melt in an hour. 

The net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour is 20 - 8 = 12.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take Jay to build 60 snowballs at a rate of 12 snowballs per hour.

Time = Total snowballs / Net rate per hour
Time = 60 / 12
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can use a simple division problem. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age

We are given that John's current age is 28. We can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's age

To solve for Jim's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Combine like terms:

3x + 3

We know that the total number of slices is 8. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 3 = 8

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

Since x represents the number of slices Doxa ate, we can calculate the number of slices each person ate:

Doxa: x = 5/3
Her sister: x + 1 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3
Her brother: x + 2 = 5/3 + 2 = 11/3

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person:

(5/3) + (8/3) + (11/3) = 24/3 = 8

The total number of slices eaten is 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x + 12 bandages from the first day, so they had x + 12 + 28 = x + 40 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had x + 40 - 25 = x + 15 bandages left.

Since they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, we can set up the equation x + 15 = 78.

Solving for x, we get x = 78 - 15 = 63.

The final answer is: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to determine the length of her hair and multiply it by the cost per inch. 

Her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.

The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, so the total cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The cost of the color is $40. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the haircut and the cost of the color: $60 + $40 = $100.

The final answer is: $100"
"As a financial analyst specializing in hourly wage calculations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Jen's earnings for April.

To calculate Jen's total earnings, we need to consider her hourly rate and attendance. Her hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week. Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate her total hours worked as follows:

Total hours worked = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks
Total hours worked = 7.5 * 6 * 4
Total hours worked = 180 hours

Next, we can calculate her total earnings from her hourly rate:

Total earnings from hourly rate = 180 hours * $1.5/hour
Total earnings from hourly rate = $270

Since Jen has complete attendance, she receives an additional $10. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

Total earnings = $270 + $10
Total earnings = $280

The final answer is: $280"
"To calculate Jason's total earnings, we need to multiply the frequency of each task by its respective payment and add them together.

- Earning from doing laundry: 1 time * $3.00 = $3.00
- Earning from taking the trash out: 2 times * $0.75 = $1.50
- Earning from cleaning the room: 1 time * $1.50 = $1.50

Total earnings: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"As a marine biologist specializing in cetacean physiology, I can provide a precise calculation for the total blood volume of ten sharks.

Given that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the blood volume of a single shark as follows:

Blood volume of a shark = 3 * Blood volume of a whale
= 3 * 40 gallons
= 120 gallons

To find the total blood volume of ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of a single shark by 10:

Total blood volume of ten sharks = 120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks
= 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1200}$"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct periods: morning, 10:00, and evening.

Let's denote the number of people who entered the restaurant in the morning as M, the number of people who entered at 10:00 as T, and the number of people who entered by evening as E.

We are given the following information:

M = 50 (people who entered in the morning)
T = 40 (people who entered at 10:00)
E = 3T (people who entered by evening, which is three times the number of people who entered at 10:00)

We also know that the total number of people who entered by evening is the sum of the people who entered in the morning, at 10:00, and by evening. Therefore, we can write the equation:

M + T + E = 290

Substituting the given values, we get:

50 + 40 + 3(40) = 290

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since each pack has 5 pens, and Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it is 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first determine the cost of the scotch and cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 ÷ 10 = $60

Since the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, we can calculate the cost per bottle of cognac by multiplying the cost of the scotch by 1.5:

Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 × 1.5 = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:

Total cost = $600 + $1800 = $2400.

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{140}$"
"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we need to calculate the amount remaining after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by translating the given statement into an equation. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is x.

The statement ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" can be written as 4x + 8.

The equation is: 4x + 8 = 40

Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32

"To determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66. This is calculated as 66 / 3 = 22. Since these fish have red stripes, we can conclude that 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find the remaining fish. We subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish: 66 - 22 = 44.

Now, we find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which is 5/11 * 44 = 20. These fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes: 22 + 20 = 42.

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to analyze the given information.

Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, we can calculate the height of the first floor as follows:

Height of the first floor = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches

Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, the height of the second floor is:

Height of the second floor = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches

Now, to find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the second floor from the height of the first floor:

Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Height of the first floor - Height of the second floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"To determine the number of shells team Gogetters found, we need to calculate the percentage of remaining shells after team Alphas and team The finders have found their respective shares.

First, we find the number of shells team Alphas found, which is 40% of 700.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Next, we calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas found 280 shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Then, we find the number of shells team The finders found, which is 60% of the remaining shells.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Now, we can find the number of shells team Gogetters found by subtracting the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the walking distance of the last dog, we can start by finding the total walking distance required for all four dogs. Since the average walking distance per dog is 3 miles, we can multiply this by the total number of dogs.

Total walking distance = Average walking distance per dog * Number of dogs
Total walking distance = 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs
Total walking distance = 12 miles

Now, we can subtract the known walking distances of the first three dogs from the total walking distance to find the walking distance of the last dog.

Walking distance of the last dog = Total walking distance - Walking distance of the first dog - Walking distance of the second dog - Walking distance of the third dog
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - 1 mile - 4 miles - 3 miles
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - 8 miles
Walking distance of the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can follow a straightforward approach.

First, we need to determine the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be calculated as:

Loan Amount = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan is used to pay off debts. Since 60% of the loan is used for debt repayment, we can calculate this as:

Amount Used for Debt Repayment = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

Finally, to find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used for debt repayment from the loan amount:

Amount Leftover = Loan Amount - Amount Used for Debt Repayment
= $100,000 - $60,000
= $40,000

Therefore, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts."

"To calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to consider the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day for 3 days, resulting in 2 * 3 = 6 liters. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day for 5 days, resulting in 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Total amount of water removed = 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons

"As a dean of a private school, I can provide a detailed analysis of the capacity of both schools.

To find the capacity of John's school, we need to calculate the capacity of one of his classes. Since each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = (1/8) * 120
= 120/8
= 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15
= 30

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school)
= 120 + 30

"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial loan amount of $300. The interest rate is 2% of the initial amount.

Interest = 2% of $300 = 0.02 * $300 = $6

The monthly payment for 11 months is $25. To find the total amount paid in 11 months, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months.

Total amount paid in 11 months = $25 * 11 = $275

Now, we add the interest to the total amount paid in 11 months to find the amount to be paid in the twelfth month.

"To calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the packing efficiency. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, so its volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

However, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

The true number of red jelly beans is given as 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

The bus had an initial capacity of 200 people and 20 people were already on board. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This is equivalent to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing passengers, the total becomes 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus. 

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"Meatball Conundrum: A Culinary Conundrum

When it comes to scaling up meatball production, it's essential to consider the ratio of meat to seasoning. Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is a crucial component of his meatballs, and we must calculate the exact amount required to achieve the desired yield.

To determine the amount of seasoning needed, we can use the following formula:

Amount of seasoning (tbsp) = (Number of meatballs / 16) * 2

Plugging in the desired number of meatballs (80), we get:

Amount of seasoning (tbsp) = (80 / 16) * 2

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies Carly made.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. This can be represented as an equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to consider the discounted price of the services and the additional cost of nail art.

The original cost of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic equation, which can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.

We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. 

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, Shelley has x + 8 paintings.

Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"As a transportation expert, I can analyze Michael's travel scenario. To calculate the percentage of the distance covered, we need to determine the total hours he traveled and then divide it by the total distance.

Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he traveled for 3 days. Assuming a 24-hour day, the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

Final answer: 84"
"To determine the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, we need to consider the number of teachers who were present. 

The number of teachers who were sick is 13, and the number of substitute teachers is 9. To find the total number of teachers, we simply add these two numbers together.

Total number of teachers = Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Total number of teachers = 13 + 9
Total number of teachers = 22

Therefore, there were 22 teachers at Rydell Elementary School that day."
"As a macaroni and cheese aficionado, I can confidently calculate the total cost of making this comfort food classic. To determine the annual expenditure, we need to consider the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese.

The cost of pasta per week is $1.00, while the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00. Since Bud spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is $6.00. Therefore, the total cost per week is $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00.

To calculate the annual cost, we multiply the weekly cost by 52 weeks: $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

The final answer is: $520."
"To calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we need to divide the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) by the total number of minutes in 40 hours (40 * 60 = 2400 minutes) and then multiply by 100.

Time spent cleaning = (1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100
Time spent cleaning = (1/2) * 100
Time spent cleaning = 50%

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we must first calculate the total capacity of the shelves. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 / 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

Final answer: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate Rose's profit, we need to consider the cost and selling price of the eggs.

First, let's find the total cost:
Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. The total cost is 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Next, let's find the total selling price:
Rose will sell each egg for $1, so the total selling price is 60 x $1 = $60.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
= $60 - $12
= $48

The final answer is: $48"
"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem into steps:

First, we find the number of hats that are not red. Since half of the hats are red, the remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we find the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"As a seasoned expert in the field of snack economics, I can confidently analyze the situation and provide a precise calculation.

To determine the cost of each stick of jerky, we need to first find the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off. So, the discounted price is:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we can divide the discounted price by 30 to find the cost per stick:

$15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100:

$0.50 × 100 = 50 cents

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate the required percentage as follows:

Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110
Required percentage = 70%

To find the number of questions she needs to get correct, we can multiply the total number of questions by the required percentage:

Number of questions needed = Total questions * Required percentage
= 110 * 0.7
= 77

Since Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions, we can subtract this from the total number of questions she needs to get correct to find out how many she needs to get right on the second test:

Number of questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions got correct on the first test
= 77 - 42
= 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to find the number of blueberry cubes. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes can be represented as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4
= 96

The final answer is: $\boxed{96}$"
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored, we can use the formula:

Total points = Number of games played per year * Number of years * Points scored per game

Given:
Number of games played per year = 40

Total points = 40 * 4 * 21
Total points = 3360

Therefore, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."
"Let's break down the events step by step to determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with.

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

However, he then found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

Unfortunately, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble. Therefore, he is now left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can use the given conversion rates. 

Let's break it down:

1. For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 potential customer. 
2. For every 2 potential customers, 1 car is sold.

First, we need to find the number of potential customers required to get 15 cars. Since 1 car is sold for every 2 potential customers, we can multiply the number of cars by 2:

15 cars * 2 = 30 potential customers

Next, we need to find the number of telephone calls required to get 30 potential customers. Since 1 potential customer is generated for every 25 telephone calls, we can divide the number of potential customers by 25:

30 potential customers / 25 = 1.2

Since we can't make a fraction of a call, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we meet the target. However, in this case, we can make the exact number of calls required to get 30 potential customers.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

Let's calculate the number of candles in each half of the house:
Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms.
4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

"The Rubik's cube is a classic puzzle that requires a systematic approach to solve efficiently. To determine the total time it takes to solve the cube, we need to break down the time required for each side.

The first side takes 5 minutes to solve. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the time for all sides:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

Final Answer: The final answer is 30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that there are 20 helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. To find the number of footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

"To calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first determine the total minutes he spends on calls in a week. Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls in a week.

"As an artist and varnish expert, I can analyze the situation based on my knowledge of varnish drying times.

When applying a coat of varnish to paintings, the drying time is a crucial factor to consider. The standard drying time for the old varnish is 7 minutes per painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry per painting.

To determine the difference in drying time for 6 paintings, we can calculate the total drying time for each varnish type:

Old varnish: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
New varnish: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three categories based on the number of plants and the amount of water each group requires.

First, we'll calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be expressed as 4 x 0.5 cups.

Next, we'll calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that require 1 cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 x 1 cup.

Lastly, we'll calculate the water needed for the remaining 8 plants, which require a quarter of a cup of water. This can be expressed as 8 x 0.25 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 4 x 0.5 + 8 x 1 + 8 x 0.25.

To calculate this, we'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply the numbers: 4 x 0.5 = 2, 8 x 1 = 8, and 8 x 0.25 = 2.
2. Add the results: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water for her plants every day.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes

"The art of popcorn calculation. As a master of mathematical modeling, I shall break down the problem into manageable components.

Let's denote the initial popping rate as r. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop, which can be represented as 20 = r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 40 kernels per second.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, resulting in 60 kernels. This can be represented as 60 = 3r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 40 kernels per second, confirming our initial calculation.

In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, resulting in 80 kernels. This can be represented as 80 = 4r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 40 kernels per second, again confirming our initial calculation.

In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, resulting in 40 kernels. This can be represented as 40 = 0.5r * 0.5. Solving for r, we get r = 80 kernels per second, which is not possible given the previous calculations. However, we can proceed with the given information.

Now, let's calculate the total number of kernels that popped: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

In the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 kernels.

The total number of kernels is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

"The problem at hand involves calculating the net distance Elvis traveled from his house. To approach this, we can utilize the concept of displacement, which is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions.

Given that Elvis traveled west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph, we can calculate the distance covered in that direction:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 5 hours
= 90 miles

Similarly, Elvis traveled east for 8 hours at the same speed:

Distance = Speed × Time
= 18mph × 8 hours
= 144 miles

To find the net distance from his house, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:

Net Distance = Distance East - Distance West
= 144 miles - 90 miles
= 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.

"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to apply the depreciation rates for each year.

The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year, which can be expressed as 0.3 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the initial value of the boat.

Year 1: 
Initial value = $9000
Depreciation = 0.3 * $9000 = $2700
Value after 1 year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year, which is also 0.3 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the value after the first year.

Year 2:
Initial value = $6300
Depreciation = 0.3 * $6300 = $1890
Value after 2 years = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the value after the second year.

Year 3:
Initial value = $4410
Depreciation = 0.2 * $4410 = $882
Value after 3 years = $4410 - $882 = $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."

"To calculate the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to determine the cost of the bus trips and add it to the cost of the hotel.

The cost of one bus trip is 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of $80.

Cost of one bus trip = 0.1 x $80 = $8

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost of the bus trips is:
$8 x 7 = $56

The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80.

Total cost = Cost of hotel + Cost of bus trips
Total cost = $80 + $56
Total cost = $136

"To determine the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as x. Since Dallas initially had 25 marbles and ended up with 21 after dropping 4, we can set up the equation:

25 - 4 = 21

This equation represents the initial amount of marbles Dallas had minus the 4 marbles dropped, resulting in the final amount of 21.

To find the value of x, we can set up another equation:

52 - x = 25

This equation represents the initial amount of marbles Mazie had minus the number of marbles she gave to Darla, resulting in the amount Dallas initially had.

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 25 from 52:

52 - x = 25
x = 52 - 25
x = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: 27"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there are 3 family members (2 adults and 1 child), the total cost of the tickets is:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38."

The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, and the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds. Additionally, there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, so their combined weight is 150 pounds.

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."
"To determine the total length of crepe paper needed, we must calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.

Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15)
Perimeter = 2 * 35
Perimeter = 70

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can use the formula for calculating the average of two numbers: (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2.

Given that Mia is 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To determine Anna's time, we need to calculate half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to it. 

Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Since Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, we add 2 hours to 5 hours.

Anna's time = 5 + 2 = 7 hours.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we can calculate the daily feed consumption as follows:

5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Now, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered feed to find the amount left:

300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the total number of hot dogs John needs, we can calculate the total number of hot dogs required for the party.

Number of guests: 20
Number of hot dogs per guest: 2
Total hot dogs required: 20 * 2 = 40

Since John already has 4 hot dogs, we subtract those from the total:
40 - 4 = 36

To find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy, we divide the remaining hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
36 ÷ 6 = 6

Since John needs 6 packs, and each pack costs $2, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
6 * $2 = $12

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Frances sells cupcakes at $2 each and cookies at $1 each. She sells 20 cupcakes and 40 cookies. To find her total income from cupcakes, we multiply the number of cupcakes by the price per cupcake:

20 cupcakes * $2 per cupcake = $40

To find her total income from cookies, we multiply the number of cookies by the price per cookie:

40 cookies * $1 per cookie = $40

Now, let's add her total income from cupcakes and cookies:

$40 + $40 = $80

Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each. To find her total cost, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

5 trays * $4 per tray = $20

To find out how much money Frances has left, we subtract her total expenses from her total income:

"To determine the total number of children following the ice cream truck, we can break down the process step by step.

Initially, there are 5 children. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, resulting in a total of 5 + 5 = 10 children. 

On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so the total number of children becomes 10 + 10*2 = 10 + 20 = 30.

However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so the total number of children remaining is 30 - 5 = 25.

Therefore, there are 25 children following the truck.

Final Answer: The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to find the total number of meals given out. We can do this by adding the meals distributed on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48
Meals given out = 142

Now, we subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals to find the number of meals left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$"
"To find the total age of the siblings, we can break it down into steps. 

First, we know the age of the younger brother is 12 years old. Since the older brother is twice as old as the younger brother, we can calculate the age of the older brother by multiplying the younger brother's age by 2.

The age of the older brother = 12 * 2 = 24 years old

Now, we have the ages of all the siblings: 
- 2 brothers: 12 and 24 years old
- 3 sisters: 16 years old each

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all the siblings: 
Total age = 12 + 24 + (16 * 3)
Total age = 12 + 24 + 48
Total age = 84

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"To calculate the total time spent on meditation and yoga, we need to break down the information into manageable components.

Charisma practices meditation for 15 minutes, twice a day, which equals 30 minutes per day. Since she does this for 4 weeks, the total time spent on meditation is:

30 minutes/day * 2 sessions/day * 4 weeks = 240 minutes

She also practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. The total time spent on yoga is:

60 minutes/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes

The total time spent on meditation and yoga is the sum of these two values:

240 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1440 minutes

To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60:

1440 minutes / 60 = 24 hours

Therefore, Charisma has spent a total of 24 hours on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks."

"As a botanist specializing in the study of sunflowers, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the total number of seeds.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. 

To find the number of seeds in a large sunflower, we need to calculate 50% of 36. This can be done by multiplying 36 by 0.5, resulting in 18. Adding 18 to 36 gives us 54 seeds in a large sunflower.

Now, we can find the total number of seeds by adding the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54): 36 + 54 = 90.

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is 90.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pens George has as G. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express Timothy's pens as 3G. 

We are given that George has 18 pens, so G = 18. Now, we can find Timothy's pens by multiplying 18 by 3.

3G = 3(18) = 54

Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express Sarah's pens as (1/2) * 54.

(1/2) * 54 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we need to consider the given information. We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, making her 72"". Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, her height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jake is shopping at a clothing store with a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we need to calculate the total cost of the T-shirts.

First, we'll calculate the cost of the first T-shirt, which is the full price: $8.

For the second T-shirt, there's a 50% discount. To find the discount amount, we'll multiply the original price by 0.5 (which is equivalent to 50%): $8 x 0.5 = $4.

Now, we'll subtract the discount from the original price to find the cost of the second T-shirt: $8 - $4 = $4.

The total cost of the T-shirts is the sum of the cost of the first T-shirt and the cost of the second T-shirt: $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. To find the discount amount, we'll multiply the original price by 0.4 (which is equivalent to 40%): $40 x 0.4 = $16.

Now, we'll subtract the discount from the original price to find the cost of the shoes: $40 - $16 = $24.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes: $12 + $24 = $36.

"Let's break down the events step by step to determine the number of cookies Randy has now.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he consumes 3 cookies in total. To find the remaining cookies, we subtract 3 from the initial total:

9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies
18 - 3 = 15 cookies

He then eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:

15 - 2 = 13 cookies

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, reducing the total to:

13 - 2 = 11 cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding 8 new cookies to his collection:

For the first half (6 toys at $5 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 5 = $30

For the second half (6 toys at $7 each), Matthew would earn: 6 * 7 = $42

Total amount Matthew would earn: $30 + $42 = $72

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can use the concept of proportional relationships. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can set up a proportion to find the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Let x be the average enrollment at Butler High School. We can set up the proportion:

(3/4) = x / 4000

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

3 * 4000 = 4x
12000 = 4x

Now, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 12000 / 4
x = 3000

Now that we have the average enrollment at Butler High School, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools:

Difference in average enrollment = Average enrollment at Norman High School - Average enrollment at Butler High School
= 4000 - 3000
= 1000

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can use the principle of subtraction. 

Let's break down the information given:

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we subtract the sum of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - (Rainbow cookies + Oatmeal cookies)
= 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
The total number of items Igor had is T + B + P, and we know this equals 29. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

To solve for B, we can subtract 8 and 16 from both sides of the equation:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that Igor lost some beakers. Let's re-examine the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

We can rewrite the equation as:

B + 24 = 29

Subtracting 24 from both sides gives us:

B = 5

This means that Igor had 5 beakers initially. Since the correct number of beakers requested was 7, Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

The correct answer is 2."
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 x 4 x 2
Total screws needed = 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket, so 10 x 2 = 20).

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to determine the individual amounts each person raised and then add them together.

Let's start by identifying the amount each person raised:

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.
Sarah raised $300.

Now, let's add the amounts together: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2080.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed and distance. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as V miles per minute and Aaron's speed as A miles per minute. We know that Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, so A = 2V.

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 2 miles. We also know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, we can set up a proportion to relate their speeds and times:

A = 2V
A = 2V
2V = 2V

Now, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. We can set up an equation using this formula for both Aaron and Vanessa:

Time (Aaron) = Distance (Aaron) / Speed (Aaron)
16 = 2 / A
16 = 2 / (2V)
16 = 1 / V

Now, we can solve for V:

V = 1 / 16
V = 1/16 miles per minute

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we can find the time it took her to complete her part of the race by multiplying her speed by the distance:

Time (Vanessa) = Distance (Vanessa) / Speed (Vanessa)
Time (Vanessa) = 4 / (1/16)
Time (Vanessa) = 4 * 16
Time (Vanessa) = 64 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

64"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can use a simple calculation. Since he wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we can multiply the length of the dock by 3.

Total line required = 3 x 200
Total line required = 600 feet

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount he needs to buy, we subtract the amount he already has from the total amount required.

Total line to buy = Total line required - 6 feet
Total line to buy = 600 - 6
Total line to buy = 594 feet

The caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total."
"As a financial analyst specializing in restaurant operations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Tom's restaurant revenue.

To calculate the weekly revenue, we need to consider the number of reservations, meal prices, and the cost of wine. Assuming the restaurant operates 2 days a week, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (Number of reservations * Number of meals per reservation * Meal price) + (Number of reservations * Wine price)
= (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
= $60 + $30
= $90 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $90 * 2
= $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To determine the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the formula for calculating the selling price with a percentage profit:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)

Given:
Cost Price = $80
Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25

Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons, we can find the selling price per watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"

"To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to consider the discount and labor costs.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets an 80% discount, the discounted price is 20% of the original price (100% - 80% = 20%). 

20% of $400 is calculated as 0.20 * $400 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

Final answer: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. We can write another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

Now we have a system of two linear equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

Rearranging the first equation, we get:

y = 20 - x

Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get:

2x + 4(20 - x) = 70

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2x + 80 - 4x = 70
-2x + 80 = 70
-2x = -10
x = 5

Now that we have found x, we can find y by substituting x into one of the original equations:

y = 20 - x
y = 20 - 5
y = 15

So, there are 5 chickens and 15 cows.

The final answer is: 5"
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4):

56 ÷ 4 = 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

Final Answer: The final answer is 14."
