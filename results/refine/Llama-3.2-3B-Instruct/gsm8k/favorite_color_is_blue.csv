"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She consumes 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.

Next, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends, reducing her remaining eggs to 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Since Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, we can calculate her daily earnings by multiplying the number of eggs sold (9) by the price per egg ($2).

9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is: $18"
"The calculation for the total number of bolts required for the robe is based on the given information. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, we can calculate the total bolts as follows:

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: 2 / 2 = 1 bolt

Total bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber
Total bolts = 2 + 1
Total bolts = 3

Therefore, the total number of bolts required for the robe is 3."
"To calculate the profit made by Josh after flipping the house, we need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs. 

The original price of the house was $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%. 

To find the new value, we multiply the original price by 2.5 (1 + 1.5 for 150% increase). 

New value = $80,000 * 2.5
= $200,000

Now, we subtract the original price from the new value to find the profit.

Profit = New value - Original price
= $200,000 - $80,000
= $120,000

The final answer is: $120,000"
"To calculate the total number of meters James runs per week, we can multiply the number of sprints per week by the number of meters per sprint.

Number of sprints per week: 3
Number of meters per sprint: 60

Total meters per week = 3 * 60
Total meters per week = 180

Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week."
"As a poultry nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Wendi's feeding schedule.

To determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock. Since each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day, and Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Wendi has already provided 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon. To find the amount needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to provide 20 cups of feed for the final meal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, while subsequent glasses are 60% of the price of the first glass. 

The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3.
The cost of the remaining 15 glasses is 15 * $3 = $45.

The total cost is $5 + $45 = $50.

The final answer is $50."
"Sheep Population Calculation

As a sheep expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. 

First, we know Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city: 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260.

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 260.

Final Answer: The final answer is 260."
"To calculate the total time it takes to download the file, we need to consider the interrupted download process. 

First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute for 80% of the file, which is 160 GB. The time taken for this part of the download is:

Time = Total size / Download rate
Time = 160 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time = 80 minutes

Since the download is interrupted, Carla has to restart from the beginning. The second download also takes 80 minutes.

Total time taken = Time for first download + Time for second download
Total time taken = 80 minutes + 80 minutes
Total time taken = 160 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we can break down the journey into segments.

First, we calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

Since he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

Next, we calculate the distance John traveled during the 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

Finally, we calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph:
Distance = Speed * Time = 80 * 2 = 160 miles

The total distance John traveled is the sum of these segments:
Total distance = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles

Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
Distance from home = Total distance - Initial distance = 355 - 180 = 175 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{175}$"
"To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to consider her regular hourly rate and overtime pay.

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, and she worked 40 hours at this rate. Her earnings for the first 40 hours are:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

For the overtime hours, we need to multiply her regular hourly rate by 1.2 (overtime pay multiplier) and then multiply by the number of overtime hours. Since she worked 5 hours of overtime, her overtime earnings are:

5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60

Total earnings for the week:
$400 + $60 = $460

The final answer is: $460"
"To calculate the total number of downloads over the three months, we can break it down as follows:

Let's denote the number of downloads in the first month as D1, the number of downloads in the second month as D2, and the number of downloads in the third month as D3.

We know that D1 = 60.

D2 is three times the number of downloads in the first month, so D2 = 3 * D1 = 3 * 60 = 180.

D3 is 30% less than D2, so D3 = 0.7 * D2 = 0.7 * 180 = 126.

The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of D1, D2, and D3: Total = D1 + D2 + D3 = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

The final answer is: $\boxed{366}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the pastries, we can break down the costs as follows:

Donuts: 3 dozen donuts * $68 per dozen = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 dozen cupcakes * $80 per dozen = $160
Mini cheesecakes: 6 dozen cheesecakes * $55 per dozen = $330

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost of the pastries is $694."
"To determine the break-even point for the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year. The initial cost of the tree is $90, and the annual expenses are $3. The tree grows 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.50 each.

Net profit per year = (7 lemons/year * $1.50/lemon) - $3/year
Net profit per year = $10.50 - $3
Net profit per year = $7.50

To find the break-even point, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:

Break-even point = Initial cost / Net profit per year
Break-even point = $90 / $7.50
Break-even point = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years for the lemon tree to start generating a profit.

Final answer: 12"
"As a door-to-door saleswoman, I've encountered various sales scenarios, and I'm happy to help you with this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up an equation to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners.

Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as x. Melanie sold 1/3 of x at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green and red house is x/3 + 2.

The number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling at the green and red house is x - (x/3 + 2) = 2x/3 - 2.

She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/6 - 1.

The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1. Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2 + x/6 - 1) = 5

Combine like terms: x - x/3 - x/6 - 1 = 5

To simplify, find a common denominator (6): 6x/6 - 2x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 - 1 = 5

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 5 + 1

Combine like terms: 4x/6 - 6/6 = 6

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 4x - 6 = 36

Add 6 to both sides: 4x = 42

Divide both sides by 4: x = 42/4

x = 10.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the correct answer is not a whole number, which is not possible in this scenario. We'll re-evaluate the problem.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to first find the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
Number of students remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 students

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students

Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

The final answer is 60."
"As a financial analyst specializing in investment and market trends, I've analyzed the potential returns on both options. To maximize profit, we need to consider the projected market growth for both the jewelry and electronic gadgets.

The jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5%, while the electronic gadgets market will rise by 1.2%. We can calculate the potential value of each option using the formula:

Potential Value = Initial Cost * (1 + Market Increase)

For the jewelry:
Potential Value = $5,000 * (1 + 0.025)
Potential Value = $5,000 * 1.025
Potential Value = $5,250

For the electronic gadgets:
Potential Value = $8,000 * (1 + 0.012)
Potential Value = $8,000 * 1.012
Potential Value = $8,160

Based on the calculations, the electronic gadgets offer a higher potential value, resulting in a higher profit. To determine the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the potential value:

Profit = Potential Value - Initial Cost
Profit = $8,160 - $8,000
Profit = $160

Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit, with a potential profit of $160."
"As a transportation engineer specializing in rail network analysis, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the distances covered by each train.

Since the two trains left San Rafael at the same time and traveled westward for 80 miles each, we can consider this as the initial leg of their journey. On the second day, they traveled northward, covering a combined distance of 150 miles.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances covered on both days. Since they traveled the same distance westward, each train covered 80 miles on the first day. On the second day, they traveled 150 miles northward. Since they traveled the same distance, each train covered 150 miles northward.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances covered on both days:
80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{230}$"
"As a financial analyst specializing in salary calculations, I'd be happy to help you determine Jill's annual salary.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from teaching and coaching. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Hours worked per week: 35 hours
- Hourly wage: $20
- Weekly earnings: 35 hours * $20/hour = $700
- Annual earnings from teaching: $700 * 50 weeks = $35,000

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Hours worked per week: 15 hours
- Hourly wage: $30
- Weekly earnings: 15 hours * $30/hour = $450
- Annual earnings from coaching: $450 * 50 weeks = $22,500

Now, let's add her earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary:
$35,000 (teaching) + $22,500 (coaching) = $57,500

The final answer is: $57,500"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes per day by the number of days in 4 weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 weeks will have 4 * 7 = 28 days. Claire makes 3 eggs per day, so in 28 days, she will make 3 eggs/day * 28 days = 84 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we can divide 84 eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs):
84 eggs ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozen eggs.

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the required speed for Marissa to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can use the concept of average speed and the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

We know the desired average speed (4 miles per hour) and the total distance (12 miles). We also know that Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles. 

Let's denote the time spent walking the remaining distance as 't'. The total time will be the sum of the time spent walking the first 6 miles (2 hours) and the time spent walking the remaining distance (t hours).

Total Time = 2 + t

We can set up the equation using the average speed formula:

4 = 12 / (2 + t)

To solve for 't', we can multiply both sides by (2 + t):

4(2 + t) = 12

Expanding the equation:

8 + 4t = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

4t = 4

Dividing both sides by 4:

t = 1

Now that we know the time spent walking the remaining distance (1 hour), we can calculate the required speed:

Required Speed = Distance / Time
= 6 miles / 1 hour
= 6 miles per hour

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters

The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
15 * (3/5) = 9 liters

The total amount of water in both drinks initially is:
20/3 + 9 = 49/3 liters

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water left in the orange drink is:
20/3 - 1 = 17/3 liters

The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
17/3 + 9 = 17/3 + 27/3 = 44/3 liters

To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
44 ÷ 3 = 14.67

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.67}$"
"To determine the number of years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to find the difference between Raymond's current age and the age of his son.

Let's denote Raymond's current age as R and his son's age as S. We know that R = 25 (since Raymond is 25 years old) and S = 23 (since Raymond had a son at the age of 23). 

The difference between their ages is R - S = 25 - 23 = 2.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the total number of DVDs sold, we can break down the sales into separate groups and add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers. Since each of them bought one DVD, the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 3.

Next, we have the next 2 customers who bought 2 DVDs each. To find the total number of DVDs sold to this group, we multiply the number of customers by the number of DVDs each bought: 2 x 2 = 4.

The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so the total number of DVDs sold to this group is 0.

Now, let's add the total number of DVDs sold to each group: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7.

The total number of DVDs sold on Tuesday is 7."
"To determine the total length of the candle that melts, we need to calculate the difference in hours between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

The time difference is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, we can multiply the time difference by the rate of melting:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: 8"
"To find the original price of the book, we can use the formula:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discounted price is $19.50 and the discount percentage is 25%. Plugging in the values, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

The original price of the book was $26."
"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to calculate the total cost of the other items and subtract that from the total amount she paid.

The cost of the chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 x $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 x $1.50 = $6.

The total cost of these items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the cost of the pizza boxes by the cost of each box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total amount Mishka spent on clothing, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Shorts x Price per Short) + (Number of Pants x Price per Pant) + (Number of Shoes x Price per Shoe)

Given:
- Number of Shorts = 3
- Price per Short = $16.50
- Number of Pants = 3
- Price per Pant = $22.50
- Number of Shoes = 3
- Price per Shoe = $42

Total Cost = (3 x $16.50) + (3 x $22.50) + (3 x $42)
Total Cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
Total Cost = $243

Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items."
"To calculate the total cost of ice cream, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Cartons * Cost per Carton

Given that Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night and needs 60 servings in 60 days, we can calculate the number of cartons she will buy as follows:

Number of Cartons = Total Servings / Servings per Carton
= 60 servings / 15 servings per carton
= 4 cartons

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

Total Cost = Number of Cartons * Cost per Carton
= 4 cartons * $4.00 per carton
= $16.00

The final answer is: $16.00"
"To determine the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop.

The total distance of the trip is 60 miles. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

Let's break it down:

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip: 60 - 20 = 40 miles
Distance from the end of the trip to the second stop: 60 - 15 = 45 miles

However, since the second stop is before the end of the trip, we need to subtract the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop from the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip. This would result in a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context. 

Instead, we should calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop directly. 

Distance from the first stop to the second stop: 20 + 15 = 35 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the cost of the boots, we can start by finding the total cost of the two pairs of heels. 

One pair of heels costs $33. The other pair costs twice as much, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost five dollars less than the two pairs of heels, the cost of the boots can be found by subtracting $5 from the total cost of the heels: $99 - $5 = $94.

Therefore, the boots cost $94.

The final answer is 94."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and algebra. Let's assume Darrell's current age is 7x and Allen's current age is 11x.

We know that their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation: 
7x + 11x = 162

Combine like terms: 
18x = 162

Divide both sides by 18: 
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find their current ages: 
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

The final answer is: $\boxed{109}$"
"To calculate the average guess, we need to find the total number of jelly beans guessed by all three individuals and then divide by the number of guesses.

The first person guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second person guessed 20 more than half of the first person's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that is 60.

The third person guessed 25% more than the first person's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and 20 more than that is 100.

Now, let's add the guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"As a canine care specialist, I can provide a detailed analysis of the time spent on dog care. To calculate the total hours spent taking care of dogs per week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent on each dog per day.

Given that each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day, we can calculate the total daily care time as follows:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

To find the total weekly care time, we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours per week taking care of his dogs.

The final answer is: 35"
"Let's dive into the world of coin collection and solve the problem.

We are given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of silver coins as 'x'. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as 'x + 30'.

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which equals 110. We can write this as an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:
2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:
2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:
x + 30 = 40 + 30
x + 30 = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final answer is: 70"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Raymond has 40 jewels. To find out how many jewels Aaron has, we need to calculate half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5.

Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. 

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 23

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total points scored by Mike, we need to determine the points scored in the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes separately.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4, we multiply 4 by 0.25.

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4
= 1

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Total points scored = Points scored in the first 20 minutes + Points scored in the second 20 minutes
= 4 + 5
= 9

The final answer is: 9"
"To calculate Terry's total yogurt expenditure over 30 days, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Yogurts Consumed * Cost per Yogurt

Given that Terry eats 2 yogurts per day and the sale price is 4 yogurts for $5, we can first find the cost of one yogurt:

Cost per Yogurt = Total Cost / Number of Yogurts
= $5 / 4
= $1.25

Now, we can calculate the total cost of yogurts consumed over 30 days:

Total Cost = 2 Yogurts/day * 30 days * $1.25
= 2 * 30 * 1.25
= 75

Therefore, Terry spends $75 on yogurts over 30 days.

The final answer is: $75"
"To determine the number of Lego sets John still has, we need to calculate the initial amount of money he had and then subtract the amount he spent on video games.

John sold 13 Lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets is 13 * 15 = $195.

He spent $20 on 8 video games, so the total amount he spent is 8 * 20 = $160.

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, the amount he had initially is $195 + $5 = $200.

Now, we know John had $200 initially and spent $195 on Lego sets. To find out how many Lego sets he had initially, we can divide the total amount he got from selling the Lego sets by the price of each set: 195 / 15 = 13.

However, we know he had 13 Lego sets initially. The question asks how many Lego sets he still has, but the information given doesn't provide any information about the number of Lego sets he has left.

Since John sold all his Lego sets, he now has 0 Lego sets.

The final answer is: 0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate his total weekly running time and then divide the total distance by that time.

Since John runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days, we can calculate his total weekly running time as follows:

Total weekly running time = 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day)
Total weekly running time = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5
Total weekly running time = 6 hours

Now, we can find John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

Speed = Total distance / Total time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour

The final answer is 10."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into its components. Dana's speed is composed of three different rates: running, walking, and skipping. We are given that she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, which is half of her running speed. Therefore, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time spent on each activity. The total time is 6 hours, so the time spent running is 6 / 3 = 2 hours, and the time spent walking is also 6 / 3 = 2 hours.

The distance traveled while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

The distance traveled while walking is 3 miles per hour * 2 hours = 6 miles.

The total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Suzy's iPhone age as S, Ben's iPhone age as B, and Brandon's iPhone age as D.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, so S = 1.

We also know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so B = 2S = 2(1) = 2.

Finally, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so D = 4B = 4(2) = 8.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the maximum distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the gemstone, we need to calculate the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone is three times her throwing distance without the gemstone. Let's denote the throwing distance without the gemstone as x. Then, the throwing distance with the gemstone is 3x.

We know that the throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 1200.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 1200 / 3 = 400.

Now, we need to find the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames. This distance is the difference between the throwing distance with the gemstone (3x) and the distance the dragon can breathe fire (1000 feet): 3x - 1000.

Substituting the value of x, we get: 3(400) - 1000 = 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Let's denote the total number of pieces initially set out as T and the number of pieces taken as P. We know that T = 5 pies * 8 pieces per pie = 40 pieces. We also know that the remaining pieces are 14. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests can be calculated as: P = T - remaining pieces
P = 40 - 14
P = 26

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the remaining calories in your daily target and then find out how many servings you can have.

You have a daily calorie target of 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left

Since each serving has 250 calories, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings you can have.

200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is 300g, we multiply the number of servings by the weight per serving to find the total weight.

0.8 * 300 = 240g

Therefore, you can eat 240g of chips."
"As a candle expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Charlie's candle-making business.

To calculate the net profit, we need to consider the cost of materials and the selling price of the candles. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the wicks, and he sells each candle for $2.00, we can calculate the total revenue and total cost.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of candles sold * Price per candle
Total revenue = 20 candles * $2.00 per candle
Total revenue = $40.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax and the wicks, and he used 1 pound of beeswax, the total cost is the cost of the beeswax and wicks. The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00.

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $10.00
Net profit = $30.00

The final answer is: $30."
"As a freelance blogger specializing in health topics, I've analyzed Meredith's writing schedule to calculate the total hours she spent on articles. To do this, I'll break down her writing activities for each day.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, each taking an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total hours spent on Monday is 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours, the total hours spent on Tuesday is 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday, she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday. With each article taking 4 hours, the total hours spent on Wednesday is 14 * 4 = 56 hours.

To find the total hours spent writing articles in the three days, I'll add the hours spent on each day: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours.

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as 'x'. We know that Candice initially had 80 notes, used 220 notes at work, and had 23 notes remaining.

The total number of notes can be represented as: 80 + x - 220 = 23

Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 140 = 23

Adding 140 to both sides, we get: x = 163

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 163.

The final answer is: $\boxed{163}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can represent the number of blue ties as 'x'. This means the number of red ties is 2x.

The cost of a blue tie is $40, and the cost of a red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. We can represent the cost of a red tie as 1.5 times the cost of a blue tie, which is 1.5 * 40 = $60.

The total amount spent on blue ties is $200, so we can set up the equation:
40x = 200

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 40:
x = 200 / 40
x = 5

Now that we know the number of blue ties, we can find the number of red ties:
2x = 2 * 5
2x = 10

The total amount spent on blue ties is:
5 * 40 = 200

The total amount spent on red ties is:
10 * 60 = 600

The total amount spent on ties is:
200 + 600 = 800

"To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to first calculate the total number of units and then find the number of occupied units.

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. Therefore, the total number of units is:

Total units = Number of floors * Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 * 8
Total units = 120

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 * 3/4
Occupied units = 90

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90
Unoccupied units = 30

The final answer is: 30"
"As an expert in agricultural economics, I can provide a detailed analysis of Lloyd's egg farm.

To calculate the weekly revenue from egg sales, we need to consider the number of eggs produced and sold per week. Given that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day, we can calculate the total number of eggs sold per week as follows:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Since Lloyd sells eggs by the dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
1764 eggs/week ÷ 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen eggs/week

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from egg sales per week:
147 dozen eggs/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.

"To determine the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to calculate the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM and then use that distance to find the time it takes to return.

Since Tom is sailing at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles

Now, to find the time it takes for him to get back, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.

"To determine the number of toys Uriah needs to remove, we can start by calculating the weight of the comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he is removing 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

7.5 pounds

Now, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds of comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 / 0.5 = 15

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final answer: 15"
"As a mechanic with extensive experience in tire repair, I can analyze the given scenario to determine the day with higher revenue.

To calculate the total revenue for each day, we need to consider the number of truck tires and car tires repaired. The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $480

Comparing the revenues, Friday's revenue ($480) is greater than Thursday's revenue ($520). To find the difference, we subtract the smaller revenue from the larger revenue: $480 - $520 = -$40. Since the result is negative, it means the mechanic earned less on Friday than on Thursday.

The final answer is $40."
"To determine the total number of kittens, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat had and then add them together. 

Since Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, we can calculate Patchy's kittens by multiplying Trixie's kittens by 3. 

Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12 = 36

Now, we add the number of kittens Patchy had to the number of kittens Trixie had. 

Total kittens = Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
Total kittens = 36 + 12
Total kittens = 48

The Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2.

Jean started with 30 lollipops and ate 2, so the remaining lollipops are:
30 - 2 = 28

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to consider the total weight capacity of the bridge and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. This leaves 5000 - 3755 = 245 pounds available for the weight of the boxes.

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can calculate the maximum number of boxes as follows:

Maximum number of boxes = Available weight for boxes / Weight of a single box
= 245 pounds / 15 pounds
= 16.33

Since we cannot load a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number to ensure the total weight does not exceed the bridge's limit. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 16.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to determine the total amount of the extra fees and then add the tip.

The 25% fee is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00. 

The total extra fees are $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fees) = $13.00.

Now, we add the total extra fees to the original bill: $40.00 + $13.00 = $53.00.

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip: $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

First, let's find the number of unripe oranges: 
20% of 25 = 0.2 * 25 = 5 oranges

Now, let's add the number of bad, sour, and unripe oranges: 
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

Now, subtract the total number of oranges that are not good from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges: 
25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges."
"To calculate the total amount Janet paid for the brooch, we need to consider the costs associated with the material, construction, and insurance.

The cost of the material is $500, and the cost of construction is $800. To find the total cost so far, we add these two amounts together: $500 + $800 = $1300.

Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost so far. This can be calculated as 0.10 x $1300 = $130.

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost so far to find the total amount Janet paid: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

The total amount Janet paid for the brooch is $1430."
"To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two phases of her pension plan.

In the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000. This is a straightforward calculation:

Annual pension for the first 20 years = $50,000/year * 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $1,000,000. So, her annual pension after 20 years is:

Annual pension after 20 years = $1,000,000 * 5% = $50,000

Since she quits after 30 years, she receives the fixed annual pension for 10 years and the 5% annual pension for 10 years. We can calculate the total amount she receives in the remaining 10 years as:

Annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $50,000/year * 10 years = $500,000
Annual pension due to the 5% increase = $1,000,000 * 5% * 10 years = $50,000
Total annual pension for the remaining 10 years = $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000

Now, we add the total amount she received in the first 20 years and the total amount she received in the remaining 10 years:

Total annual pension = $1,000,000 + $550,000 = $1,550,000

To find the average annual pension, we divide the total amount by the total number of years:

Average annual pension = $1,550,000 / 30 years = $51,666.67

The final answer is: $51,666.67"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service, we need to break down the payment into two parts: the initial amount for the first half of the year and the reduced amount for the second half of the year.

The initial amount for the first half of the year is $140 per month, and there are 6 months in a half year. So, the total amount paid for the first half of the year is:

140 * 6 = $840

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the amount she paid for the second half of the year is:

140 - 14 = $126

Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, she paid:

126 * 6 = $756

Now, we add the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year:

$840 + $756 = $1596

The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can help Sophia determine how far she can drive on a single tank of gas. To do this, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (mpg) of her vehicle.

We know that Sophia's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, and she used 4 gallons to fill it up. To find the remaining capacity, we subtract the used amount from the total capacity:

12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (used) = 8 gallons remaining

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, we can calculate the miles per gallon by dividing the miles traveled by the remaining gallons:

100 miles ÷ 8 gallons = 12.5 miles per gallon

This means Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12.5}$"
"To calculate the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to consider the time spent each week. 

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half of that time, which is 1 hour. So, the total hours spent on TV and reading each time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent each week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, the total hours spent on TV and reading is 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$"
"To calculate the total number of people sent by the schools, we need to consider the number of teams and coaches.

Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players. So, the total number of players per school is 2 teams * 5 players per team = 10 players per school.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players is 10 players per school * 4 schools = 40 players.

Each school also sent a coach, so the total number of coaches is 4 schools * 1 coach per school = 4 coaches.

The total number of people sent by the schools is the sum of the total number of players and coaches: 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 people.

The final answer is: $\boxed{44}$"
"Treasure hunters often face intriguing challenges when deciphering the contents of a buried treasure chest. In this case, we're presented with a specific scenario involving diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. To determine the total number of gems, we can utilize basic arithmetic operations.

Let's denote the number of diamonds as D, rubies as R, and emeralds as E. We're given the following information:

1. D = 175
2. R = D - 35
3. E = 2R

We can substitute the value of R from equation (2) into equation (3) to find the value of E:

E = 2(R)
E = 2(D - 35)
E = 2D - 70

Now, we can substitute the value of D into the equation for E:

E = 2(175) - 70
E = 350 - 70
E = 280

Now that we have the values for D, R, and E, we can calculate the total number of gems:

Total gems = D + R + E
= 175 + (175 - 35) + 280
= 175 + 140 + 280
= 595

The final answer is 595."
"To determine the number of teachers, we need to first find the total number of students. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120.

"To determine the initial amount of money Bailey had, we can use a simple subtraction equation. Let's break it down step by step.

Bailey received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. The total amount of her weekly allowance is $5 x 8 = $40.

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. To find the initial amount, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she had at the end.

Initial amount = Total amount at the end - Total allowance
Initial amount = $100 - $40
Initial amount = $60

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"As a dance instructor with expertise in choreography and class management, I can break down the calculation to ensure accuracy.

To determine Judy's weekly earnings, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes per day on weekdays, which is a total of 5 * 5 = 25 classes. Additionally, she teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

Total classes in a week = 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes

Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students is 33 * 15 = 495.

Judy charges $15 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7425.

The final answer is: $7425"
"As a culinary expert, I can confidently calculate the total number of instructions for Kelian's recipes.

Kelian has two recipes, and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first one. To find the total number of instructions, we can simply multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2.

Total instructions = 20 (instructions in Recipe 1) x 2 = 40 (instructions in Recipe 2)

Since both recipes are included, we need to add the number of instructions in both recipes to get the total.

Total instructions = 20 + 40 = 60

Therefore, Kelian has a total of 60 instructions to read to prepare the two dishes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"

"As a geology expert, I can analyze the problem from a spatial perspective. The sandcastle's levels form a geometric sequence, where each level's area is half the area of the level below it. Given that the top level has an area of 16 square units, we can calculate the areas of the subsequent levels.

Let's denote the area of the top level as A1 = 16. Since each level has half the area of the level below it, we can express the areas of the subsequent levels as:

A2 = A1 / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
A3 = A2 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4
A4 = A3 / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

To find the average area, we sum the areas of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

Average area = (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4) / 4
= (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4
= 30 / 4
= 7.5

The final answer is 7.5."
"To calculate the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to consider the feeding schedule for the puppy.

The puppy requires 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days. This can be calculated as:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day. This can be calculated as:

2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups

The total amount of food used in the first year is the sum of these two amounts:

180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags used in the first year is:

550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

"To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David, we need to first determine the amount of laundry each person does.

Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can find David's laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 4.

David's laundry = 400 / 4
David's laundry = 100 pounds

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can find his laundry by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 - 100
Difference = 100 pounds

"To determine the better price for buying 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost of each option.

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
The cost per flower in this option is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
The cost per flower in this option is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

Since $0.5 is less than $0.8333, buying in packages of 2 for $1 is the better option.

The amount of money saved is: $0.8333 - $0.5 = $0.3333

To convert this to cents, multiply by 100: $0.3333 * 100 = 33.33 cents

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of games lost as x. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be represented as x + 8.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, which is the sum of the games won and lost. This can be expressed as:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:
2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 7

Now that we have found the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by adding 8 to x:

"As a financial analyst specializing in salary calculations, I can provide a precise calculation for Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service.

To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to calculate the increase in her salary for each year.

Year 1:
Initial salary = $600
Increase = 10% of $600 = 0.1 * $600 = $60
Salary after 1 year = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
Increase = 10% of $660 = 0.1 * $660 = $66
Salary after 2 years = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
Increase = 10% of $726 = 0.1 * $726 = $72.60
Salary after 3 years = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Year 4:
Increase = 10% of $798.60 = 0.1 * $798.60 = $79.86
Salary after 4 years = $798.60 + $79.86 = $878.46

Year 5:
Increase = 10% of $878.46 = 0.1 * $878.46 = $87.846
Salary after 5 years = $878.46 + $87.846 = $966.306

Year 6:
Increase = 10% of $966.306 = 0.1 * $966.306 = $96.6306
Salary after 6 years = $966.306 + $96.6306 = $1062.9366

Year 7:
Increase = 10% of $1062.9366 = 0.1 * $1062.9366 = $106.29366
Salary after 7 years = $1062.9366 + $106.29366 = $1169.23

Year 8:
Increase = 10% of $1169.23 = 0.1 * $1169.23 = $116.923
Salary after 8 years = $1169.23 + $116.923 = $1286.153

Year 9:
Increase = 10% of $1286.153 = 0.1 * $1286.153 = $128.6153
Salary after 9 years = $1286.153 + $128.6153 = $1414.7683

Year 10:
Increase = 10% of $1414.7683 = 0.1 * $1414.7683 = $141.47683

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia's pets can be represented as x + 2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan's pets can be represented as 3(x + 2).

We are given that Cindy has 4 pets, so x = 4. Substituting this value into the expressions for Marcia and Jan's pets, we get:

Marcia's pets: 4 + 2 = 6
Jan's pets: 3(4 + 2) = 18

Now, we can find the total number of pets by adding the number of pets each person has: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28.

The total number of pets the three have is 28."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the age of Jackson as x. Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Amy's age can be represented as x + 5. We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Corey's age can be represented as (x + 5) + 2 = x + 7.

We are given that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This information can be represented as:

x + 7 = 10

To find the value of x, we can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

38 = x + 2

Now, we need to find Gerald's original time. 
x = 38 - 2
x = 36 seconds

Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time by dividing his original time by 1.1 (100% + 10% improvement).
Gerald's new time = 36 / 1.1
Gerald's new time = 32.73 seconds

The final answer is 32.73."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we can use the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can represent the number of cats as 2x, where x is the number of dogs. The number of dogs is given as 60, so the number of cats is 2 * 60 = 120.

Now, we can express the number of rabbits as (2x - 12), where x is the number of dogs. Since we know the number of dogs is 60, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Number of rabbits = (2 * 60 - 12)
= 120 - 12
= 108

The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. We can express this as:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
= 60 + 120 + 108
= 288

To calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has, we need to multiply the number of plants per ledge by the total number of ledges. Since each ledge has 2 potted plants, and there are 40 ledges, the total number of potted plants is:

2 * 40 = 80

Now, Mary will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away 40 plants. To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, we subtract the number of plants she gave away from the total number of plants she had:

80 - 40 = 40

Therefore, Mary will have 40 potted plants left.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of rings for each friend.

The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed on the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so the second friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of doorbell rings:
60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) + 25 (second friend) + 20 (first friend) = 175

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"To determine the total number of pages Solo needs to read, we can add up the pages from all the textbooks:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Since Solo has already read 15 pages, we subtract that from the total:

39 - 15 = 24 pages left to read

To find the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages per day

The final answer is 6."
"Let's break down John's water consumption into two categories: weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day, and there are 5 weekdays, resulting in a total of 3 * 5 = 15 glasses of water.

On weekends, John drinks 2 glasses of water per day, and there are 2 weekend days, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water.

To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 15 + 4 = 19.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To calculate the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the formula:

Time = Total Distance / Rate

Given:
Total Distance = 42 miles
Rate = 3 miles per 10 minutes

Time = 42 miles / 3 miles per 10 minutes
Time = 42 / 3 * 10 minutes
Time = 14 * 10 minutes
Time = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

Final answer: 140"
"To determine the number of jigsaw pieces left, we can follow these steps:

Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board, which is 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces. The remaining pieces are 1000 - 250 = 750.

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces on the board. To find a third of 750, we can divide 750 by 3: 750 ÷ 3 = 250 pieces.

The number of pieces left to be placed is the remaining pieces after her mom's turn: 750 - 250 = 500.

The final answer is 500."
"Let's dive into the world of cookie consumption. As a color enthusiast, I find the blue hues of a cookie jar to be particularly appealing. However, our focus is on the task at hand.

Given that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both of them. To do this, we'll multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3 to find Cody's consumption, then add the two amounts together.

Cody's cookie consumption = 3 * Amir's cookie consumption
Cody's cookie consumption = 3 * 5
Cody's cookie consumption = 15

Total cookie consumption = Cody's cookie consumption + Amir's cookie consumption
Total cookie consumption = 15 + 5
Total cookie consumption = 20

Therefore, Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"

The inner dimensions of the box are:
Length = 5 - 2(1) = 3 inches
Width = 6 - 2(1) = 4 inches
Height = 4 - 2(1) = 2 inches

The inner volume of one box is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
Total Volume = 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches

The final answer is: 72"
"To determine the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to analyze his TV viewing schedule.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

The total time watched on these days is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Since Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, the time he watched on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

To find the number of 30-minute episodes, we can convert 1.5 hours to minutes: 1.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 90 minutes.

Now, we divide the total minutes by 30 minutes per episode: 90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes/episode = 3 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30 minutes on Wednesday."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the situation. Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x.

This year, Henry wants to make twice as many cookies, so he bakes 2x cookies. However, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so he actually bakes 2x + 15 cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 cookies left.

We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

The final answer is: 50"
"As a fuel efficiency expert, I can help you calculate the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards.

To determine the total cost of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas and then subtract the cashback amount.

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon
Total cost of gas = $30.00

Cashback amount = Number of gallons * Cashback per gallon
Cashback amount = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon
Cashback amount = $2.00

Total cost after cashback = Total cost of gas - Cashback amount
Total cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00
Total cost after cashback = $28.00

The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards will be $28.00."
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups and then divide by 2.

Beatrice's roll-ups: 2 * 24 = 48
Marcell's roll-ups: 3 * 14 = 42

Total number of roll-ups: 48 + 42 = 90

Since they both ate their entire amount, we can divide the total by 2 to find the average number of roll-ups eaten.

Average number of roll-ups eaten: 90 / 2 = 45

The final answer is: $\boxed{45}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to find the rate at which Julia's boat is taking on water and then calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time she reaches the shore.

First, we can find Julia's rowing speed. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, her speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 20 feet / 16 seconds
= 1.25 feet/second

Next, we can find the rate at which the boat takes on water. Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, we can express this as a ratio:

Rate of water intake = 2 liters / 10 feet
= 0.2 liters/foot

Now, we can find the total distance Julia rows to reach the shore:

Distance = Speed * Time
= 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds
= 80 feet

Finally, we can find the total amount of water taken on by the boat:

Total water taken on = Rate of water intake * Distance
= 0.2 liters/foot * 80 feet
= 16 liters

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider the number of teachers, lessons per day, and the frequency of cleaning per lesson.

Given that each teacher has 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, the total number of lessons per day is 4 (number of teachers) x 2 (lessons per day) = 8 lessons per day.

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 8 (total lessons per day) x 3 (cleaning frequency per lesson) = 24 times.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To calculate the total number of flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we can use the formula for simple multiplication. 

Total flowers = Number of flowers planted per day * Number of days
Total flowers = 2 * 15
Total flowers = 30

However, we need to account for the 5 flowers that did not grow. To do this, we subtract 5 from the total.

Total flowers = 30 - 5
Total flowers = 25

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.

The final answer is 25."
"To determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to establish the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and the capacity of Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can express this as:

Number of photographs on Jamal's phone = 6 × Number of photographs on Brittany's phone

Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the equation:

1800 = 6 × Number of photographs on Brittany's phone

To find the number of photographs on Brittany's phone, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:

Number of photographs on Brittany's phone = 1800 / 6
= 300

Now, we are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. We can express this relationship as:

300 = 50x

To find the value of 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 50:

x = 300 / 50
= 6

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total cost and total revenue from selling the lumber.

The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.

The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

The total cost is the sum of these two amounts: $100 + $80 = $180.

The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, and the selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

The total revenue from selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.

The total revenue from selling the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts: $150 + $120 = $270.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $270 - $180 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of 7:13. Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 'x'. Since the total amount of water is not required, we can directly focus on the sugar.

The ratio of sugar to total parts is 7/20. We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons. We can set up the following proportion:

7/20 = 120/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

7x = 20 * 120
7x = 2400

Now, divide both sides by 7:

x = 2400 / 7
x = 342.86 (approximately)

So, Katy used approximately 343 teaspoons of sugar."
"To calculate the total amount John paid for the shoes, we can use the formula:

Total Cost = Number of Pairs * Cost per Pair

Given:
Number of Pairs = 2
Cost per Pair = $60
Number of Children = 3

Since John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child, we multiply the number of pairs by the number of children:

Total Pairs = 2 * 3 = 6

Now, we multiply the total pairs by the cost per pair:

Total Cost = 6 * $60
Total Cost = $360

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes."
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. As a customs expert, I'll break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30, and we need to find the number of containers imported on that day. Since each container has 5 vehicles, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of containers imported on the second day.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is the sum of the vehicles already present (10) and the vehicles imported on the second day (5x). This total is equal to 30:

10 + 5x = 30

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

5x = 20

Next, we can divide both sides by 5 to isolate x:

x = 20/5

x = 4

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to consider their individual salary increases.

First, we'll find Adrien's current salary. Since his salary increased by 30% four years ago, we can calculate 30% of his old salary and add it to his old salary.

Adrien's old salary = $40000
30% of Adrien's old salary = 0.3 * $40000 = $12000
Adrien's current salary = $40000 + $12000 = $52000

Next, we'll find Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation:

Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary + 30% of Lylah's salary
$40000 = Lylah's salary + 0.3 * Lylah's salary
$40000 = 1.3 * Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary = $30769.23

Now, we'll find Lylah's current salary. Since her salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate 40% of her old salary and add it to her old salary.

40% of Lylah's old salary = 0.4 * $30769.23 = $12307.69
Lylah's current salary = $30769.23 + $12307.69 = $43077.92

Finally, we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later by adding their current salaries.

Total salary = Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary
Total salary = $52000 + $43077.92
Total salary = $95077.92"
"To determine the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses in a month. 

Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week, and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of pads per week by the number of weeks per month:

2 pads/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 pads/month

Since there are 30 sheets of paper in a pad, we multiply the number of pads per month by the number of sheets per pad:

8 pads/month * 30 sheets/pad = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought and then add them together.

"To calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours and the distance covered at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.

The distance covered at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
= 30 miles

The distance covered at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours can be calculated as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
= 20 miles

The total distance covered in 7 hours is the sum of these two distances:

Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
= 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters, which means she stamps 60 / 3 = 20 letters.

Now, we know that there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. To find the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began, we need to find the original number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's call this number x.

Since Jennie stamped 20 letters, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters now is x + 20. We know this number is 30, so we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = 30

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

x = 30 - 20
x = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of spoons in the package Julia bought, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of spoons in the package as x.

We know that Julia initially bought a package of spoons, her husband gave her 5 spoons, and she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. In the end, she had a total of 12 spoons. This can be represented by the equation:

x + 5 - 3 = 12

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 2 = 12

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we know that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages by adding 6 to the number of chicken sausages.

Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6
Number of fish sausages = 44

Now, we can find the total number of sausages by adding the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages.

Total number of sausages = 38 + 44
Total number of sausages = 82

The final answer is 82."
"To find the total number of friends, we can simply add the number of friends Amy and Lily have. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, and Lily made 50 friends, we can represent this as an equation:

A = L + 20

where A is the number of friends Amy has, and L is the number of friends Lily has.

We know that L = 50, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

A = 50 + 20
A = 70

Now, we can find the total number of friends by adding the number of friends Amy and Lily have:

Total friends = A + L
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

Therefore, the total number of friends Amy and Lily have together is 120."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a pepper costs 15$. Since a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is 3 * 15 = 45$. 

An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is 45 - 5 = 40$. 

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons: 4 * 45 = 180$
- 20 peppers: 20 * 15 = 300$

The total amount of money Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 400 = 880$."
"To calculate the profit made by the hospital, we need to consider the total revenue generated from both the hospital's charges and the patients' payments.

Let's break down the problem:

1. Total time spent on patients: 
500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12,000 minutes
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time to hours:
12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 hours

2. Total revenue from patients:
500 patients * $200 per patient = $100,000

3. Total revenue from doctors:

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, which translates to 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. She also rode the luge 2 times, adding another 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. In total, Pam used 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, which equals 4 * 6 = 24 tickets. He also rode the luge 2 times, adding another 2 * 6 = 12 tickets. In total, Fred used 24 + 12 = 36 tickets.

Combining their ticket usage, we get 24 (Pam) + 36 (Fred) = 60 tickets.

The total number of tickets used that day is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. This means he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday.

The total miles walked on Monday and Tuesday is 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Since the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, we can subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total to find the miles walked on Wednesday.

Let's denote the miles walked on Wednesday as x. We can set up the equation:

28 + x = 41

To solve for x, we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:

x = 41 - 28
x = 13

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"

"The problem can be solved by using a simple algebraic equation. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. We are given that there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be represented as:

P = 4B + 22

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs. We can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

P = 4(12) + 22
P = 48 + 22
P = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The final answer is: 70"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we can use the following formula:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100

We know that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - (Number of automatic cars + Number of manual cars)
= 20 - (12 + 4)
= 20 - 16
= 4

Now, we can calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
= 0.2 * 100
= 20%

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%."
"In the context of apiculture, understanding the dynamics between the different bee populations within a hive is crucial for effective management. By applying the principles of bee biology, we can determine the number of worker bees.

Let's denote the number of queens as Q. Since there are twice as many babies (immature bees) as queens, the number of babies is 2Q. Furthermore, there are twice as many worker bees as babies, making the number of worker bees 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Given that the total number of bees is 700, we can set up the equation: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. Combining like terms yields 7Q = 700. Dividing both sides by 7 results in Q = 100.

Now that we know the number of queens, we can calculate the number of worker bees: 4Q = 4 * 100 = 400.

The final answer is: $\boxed{400}$"
"To calculate the total earnings if Jordan spent his video game time working, we need to multiply the number of hours he would work in a week by his hourly wage.

Let's break it down:

Number of hours worked in a week = 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours

Hourly wage = $10

Total earnings = Number of hours worked * Hourly wage
= 14 hours * $10/hour
= $140

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 if he spent his video game time working.

Final answer: $140"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the tax on non-food items. The tax rate is 10% of the total cost of non-food items.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

Total cost of non-food items with tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Food items: 
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total food items: $2 + $3 = $5

Total cost of everything: $11 (non-food items) + $5 (food items) = $16

The final answer is: $16"
"As a financial analyst specializing in small business operations, I've assessed Kim's housekeeping business to determine its potential profit. To calculate the profit, we need to consider the total expenses and total income.

Kim's expenses consist of bleach and cloths for each client. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle, and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. With 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach required is 8 * 2 = 16. The total cost of bleach is 16 * $2 = $32. Similarly, the total number of packs of cloths required is 8, and the total cost of cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.

Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income.

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72
Profit = $20

"As a bot specializing in agricultural calculations, I can help you determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year.

To calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to multiply the total number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests per year. Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, we can calculate the total number of pineapples per year as follows:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples/year

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we can multiply the total number of pineapples per year by 4 (since there are 4 quarters in a year):

1000 pineapples/year * 4 = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4000}$"
"To calculate the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to determine the number of pieces in each box and add them together.

The first box has 500 pieces. 
The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.

Now, let's add the number of pieces in each box:
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125

The final answer is: $\boxed{2125}$"
"To determine the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours, we need to analyze the sequence of events.

First, we know that 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then, 1/2 of those bees return in the next 6 hours, which is 1/2 * 30 = 15 bees.

Next, 2 times as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. This means that a total of 30 + 60 = 90 bees have left the hive before the last 6 hours.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before that hadn't already returned return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the previous 6 hours, 90 - 15 = 75 bees return in the last 6 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To determine the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets and then subtract the change.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the total cost is $12 + $10 = $22.

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 (total cost) + $8 (change) = $30.

The final answer is: $30"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we can use the given information that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. 

We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Charlie's and Dorothy's friends: 

Let's denote the number of Dorothy's friends as D. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write the equation as:

Charlie's friends = 3D
12 = 3D

To find the value of D, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find James' friends by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4:

James' friends = 4D
James' friends = 4 * 4
James' friends = 16

The final answer is 16."
"To determine the time Tim will be waiting for Steve, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to cover their respective distances.

Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equivalent to 15840 feet. His speed is 440 feet per minute. We can calculate his time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute
Time = 36 minutes

Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equivalent to 10560 feet. His speed is 264 feet per minute. We can calculate his time as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute
Time = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes first, we need to find the difference between their times to determine how long Tim will be waiting for Steve. This can be calculated as:

Waiting Time = Tim's Time - Steve's Time
Waiting Time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes
Waiting Time = 4 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"As a bike inflation expert, I can confidently calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made that day.

To determine the total earnings, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and multiply it by the cost per tire. 

There were 5 bicycles with 2 tires each, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
There were 3 tricycles with 3 tires each, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
There was 1 unicycle with 1 tire, so that's 1 tire.

In total, there were 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires inflated.

Each tire costs 25 cents, so the total amount of money made is 20 * 0.25 = $5.

The final answer is: $5"
"To calculate the change Carl receives after purchasing 10 packs of cookies, we need to first find the total cost of the cookies. Each pack contains 6 cookies, and each cookie costs $0.10. 

The total number of cookies is 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies. 

The total cost of the cookies is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.

Since Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4.

The final answer is $4."
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to work backwards and find the original number of french fries in the pack.

Let's denote the original number of french fries as 'x'. We know that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So, the remaining fries after the seagull ate 7 fries is x - 7.

We also know that three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. The remaining fries after the pigeons ate 9 fries is x - 7 - 9 = x - 16.

A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving 1/3 of the original amount. This can be represented as (1/3)x = x - 16. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get x = 3x - 48. Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us -2x = -48, and dividing both sides by -2 gives us x = 24.

Therefore, the original number of french fries in the pack was 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"As a mathematics expert, I can break down Kimo's class schedule into manageable parts to calculate the total number of hours he spends attending classes.

Let's analyze Kimo's class schedule:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes of 2 hours each, resulting in a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, we can multiply the weekly hours by 16 to get the total hours for the semester:

9 hours/week * 16 weeks = 144 hours
4 hours/week * 16 weeks = 64 hours

Adding these two totals together, we get:
144 hours + 64 hours = 208 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 208 hours attending classes in one semester.

The final answer is: $\boxed{208}$"
"To calculate the total length of the baked goods, we need to convert the length of each type of baked good to feet and then add them together.

First, let's convert the length of the rolls to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the rolls by dividing by 12:
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

Next, let's convert the length of the croissants to feet:
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant / 12 inches/foot = 10 feet

The baguettes are already in feet, so we don't need to convert them:
60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = 120 feet

Now, we add the lengths of all the baked goods together:
10 feet (rolls) + 10 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 140 feet

The total length of the baked goods is 140 feet."
"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in managing primate populations, I can confidently calculate the total number of bananas required for the apes.

To determine the total number of bananas needed, we must consider the monthly consumption of each species. The monkeys require 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas required for 2 months, we multiply the monthly consumption of each species by 2:

Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
Gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, let's add up the total number of bananas required:
400 (monkeys) + 800 (gorillas) + 200 (baboons) = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1400}$"
"To determine the winner of the contest, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs a total distance of 15 * 100 yards = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards. She does this 34 times, so she runs a total distance of 34 * (100 + 80) yards = 34 * 180 yards = 6120 yards.

Since 6120 yards is greater than 1500 yards, Kelly wins.

To find out how much farther Kelly ran than Blake, we subtract Blake's distance from Kelly's distance: 6120 - 1500 = 4620 yards.

The final answer is: 4620"
"To calculate the total cost of Raphael's school supplies, we can break down the costs of each item and add them together.

"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we can follow a straightforward mathematical approach.

The tank initially had 17 feet of water on Monday. On Tuesday, 7 feet more water was added, resulting in a depth of 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the water depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we multiply the depth on Tuesday by 2/3:

(2/3) * 24 = 16

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Final answer: $\boxed{16}$"
"Let's dive into the world of marine biology and tackle this problem.

To find the total number of fish caught, we need to calculate the number of fish each person caught and then add them together.

Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Lastly, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

Total number of fish caught: 19 + 13 = 32

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"The problem of calculating the price increase of a bag of marbles over time can be modeled using exponential growth. Given the initial price of $20 and a 20% increase every 2 months, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final price
P = initial price = $20
r = monthly increase rate = 20% = 0.20
n = number of periods = 36 months / 2 = 18 periods

To calculate the final price, we can use the formula:

A = 20(1 + 0.20)^18
A = 20(1.20)^18
A = 20(2.158)
A = 43.16

However, since the price increase is compounded every 2 months, we can also calculate the final price using the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n
A = 20(1 + 0.20/2)^(18*2)
A = 20(1 + 0.10)^36
A = 20(1.10)^36
A = 20(2.898)
A = 57.96

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $57.96.

The final answer is $57.96."
"To determine the total cost of all toys, we need to establish the cost of each item relative to the others.

Let's denote the cost of an action figure as A, the cost of a red car as R, and the cost of the doll as D.

We know that:
1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so D = 3A.
2. One red car costs $4, so R = $4.
3. The cost of an action figure is $5, so A = $5.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation D = 3A to find the cost of the doll:
D = 3 * $5
D = $15

Now, we can find the total cost of all toys:
Total cost = (5 red cars * $4) + (3 action figures * $5) + (1 doll * $15)
Total cost = (5 * $4) + (3 * $5) + $15
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15
Total cost = $50

The final answer is: $50"
"As a financial analyst, I can help Jackie make an informed decision about whether to do her taxes herself or hire an accountant.

When calculating the potential income loss if Jackie does her taxes herself, we need to consider the opportunity cost of her time. She will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which translates to a loss of $35 per hour. To find the total loss, we can multiply the number of hours by the hourly wage:

$35/hour * 3 hours = $105

Now, let's compare this to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost from the total loss:

$105 (loss) - $90 (cost) = $15

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"Let's dive into the problem of finding Seth's age.

We're given that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. If we denote Seth's current age as x, then Brooke's current age is x/2.

In 2 years, their ages will be x + 2 and x/2 + 2, respectively. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can set up the equation:

x + 2 + x/2 + 2 = 28

To simplify, we'll first combine like terms:

(3x/2) + 4 = 28

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 24

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So, Seth's current age is 16.

"To determine the total age of the four birds, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We know that Sally Thirty-two is 8 years old. Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirty-two, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can add up the ages of all four birds: 8 (Sally Thirty-two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"As a financial analyst, I've reviewed Jessica's debt obligations and calculated the total monthly payment. To determine the amount she pays in a year, we need to consider the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage.

The minimum payment for each debt is as follows:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

To calculate the total minimum payment, we add these amounts together: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment. This can be expressed as 0.5 x $1000 = $500.

Now, we add the 50% increase to the total minimum payment: $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find the annual payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1500 x 12 = $18,000.

The final answer is: $18,000"
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel and cut each potato. Since the potatoes are roughly the same size, we can assume that the time to peel and cut each potato is constant.

The time to peel one potato is 1.5 minutes, and the time to cut one potato is 5 seconds. To add these values, we need to convert the time to cut the potato to minutes: 5 seconds = 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the total time to prepare one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.0833 minutes = 1.5833 minutes.

To find the total time to prepare 60 potatoes, we multiply the time to prepare one potato by the number of potatoes: 60 * 1.5833 minutes = 94.999 minutes.

Converting the total time to seconds: 94.999 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 5699.94 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5699.94 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{5699.94}$"
"The art of calculating lemonade profits! As a lemonade connoisseur, I'd be delighted to help you solve this problem.

Let's break it down step by step. Juan and Carlos are selling lemonade, and we know the following:

* The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
* They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon, resulting in a revenue of $10 per gallon.
* The profit is $25.

To find the total cost, we can set up an equation:

Revenue - Cost = Profit
$10 - Cost = $25

To isolate the cost, we can add $10 to both sides of the equation:

$10 + $25 = $35

This is the total cost for 1 gallon. Since they need lemons and sugar for each gallon, the cost of lemons and sugar for 1 gallon is $5.

To find the total cost of lemons, we can divide the total cost by 1 gallon:

$35 ÷ 1 gallon = $35 per gallon

The final answer is: $35"
"To determine the number of Chinese girls, we need to first find the total number of Chinese participants. 

We know that the total number of Asians is 240, and the number of Japanese participants is 80. To find the number of Chinese participants, we subtract the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asians.

Number of Chinese = Total number of Asians - Number of Japanese
= 240 - 80
= 160

Since the number of Chinese boys is given as 60, we can find the number of Chinese girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants.

Number of Chinese girls = Total number of Chinese - Number of Chinese boys
= 160 - 60
= 100

Therefore, the number of Chinese girls is 100."
"To calculate Zaid's remaining income after all expenses and donations, we need to break down his monthly expenses.

Zaid's monthly income is 6000$. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * 6000 = $1500.

He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * 6000 = $2000.

The total amount spent so far is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

The remaining amount is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, which is 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

The amount left after donation is $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, so the total amount spent on these is $200 + $700 = $900.

The amount left after these expenses is $1250 - $900 = $350.

Therefore, Zaid will have $350 left after all these expenses and donations.

"To calculate the total number of crabs, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of crabs Bo has as B, Monic has as M, and Rani has as R. We are given that B = 40, M = B - 4, and R = M + 10.

We can express M in terms of B: M = 40 - 4 = 36.

Now, we can express R in terms of B: R = 36 + 10 = 46.

The total number of crabs is the sum of the number of crabs each person has: Total = B + M + R = 40 + 36 + 46.

Total = 40 + 36 + 46
Total = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"As a math enthusiast, I'd be happy to help you with Lloyd's earnings.

To calculate the total amount Lloyd earned, we need to multiply the hourly wage by the number of hours worked in each week and then add the results.

Lloyd earned $10 per hour. For the first week, he worked 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are $10/hour * 5 hours = $50. For the second week, he worked 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are $10/hour * 8 hours = $80.

To find the total earnings for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from each week: $50 + $80 = $130.

The final answer is: $130"
"To find the number of votes the loser got, we can use the concept of complementary probabilities. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the loser got the remaining 1/4 of the votes.

Number of votes the loser got = (1/4) * 80
= 20

The final answer is 20."
"To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to establish the relationship between the number of white carnations and the number of red roses. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can express this as:

Number of red roses = 4 * Number of white carnations

We are given that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as x. Then, the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 200

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5:

x = 200 / 5
x = 40

Now that we know the number of white carnations, we can find the number of red roses:

Number of red roses = 4 * x
= 4 * 40
= 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the ages of Jean, Mark, and Jan.

Let's denote Jan's age as J, Mark's age as M, and Jean's age as E.

From the given information, we know:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark: E = M + 2
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = (J / 2) + 5

We are also given that Jan is 30 years old, so J = 30.

Substituting J = 30 into the second equation, we get:

M - 2 = (30 / 2) + 5
M - 2 = 15 + 5
M - 2 = 20
M = 22

Now that we have Mark's age, we can find Jean's age using the first equation:

E = M + 2
E = 22 + 2
E = 24

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To determine the time difference between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for each team.

The well-rounded team's time is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's time is 60 + (57 + 54 + 51) = 60 + 162 = 222 seconds.

The difference in time is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

Therefore, the faster team will win by 2 seconds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"When analyzing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we can approach the problem from a combinatorial perspective.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is equivalent to the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6, which is 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. This can be expressed as:

P(rolling a number greater than 3) = 3/6 = 1/2

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (which is 3/6) and then the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (also 3/6), since the rolls are independent events. This can be expressed as:

P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4

Now, we can find the difference in probability by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

P(difference) = P(rolling a number greater than 3) - P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

P(difference) = (1/4) * 100% = 25%

Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Final answer: $\boxed{25\%}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can calculate Jenna's share by dividing her mom's share by 2.

Jenna's apples = Mom's apples / 2
Jenna's apples = 20 / 2
Jenna's apples = 10

To find the total number of apples picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples.

Total apples = Mom's apples + Jenna's apples
Total apples = 20 + 10
Total apples = 30

The final answer is 30."
"As a rodent behaviorist, I've studied the distribution patterns of small mammals in various environments. In this scenario, we're dealing with a pet store where rodents are being distributed straw, a common enrichment material. To determine the number of rats in each cage, we need to analyze the given information.

Let's break down the problem:

- The total number of straw pieces distributed among the small rodents is 160.
- The hamsters are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamsters, so the total straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50.
- The rabbits are kept in a pen and receive 20 pieces of straw.

To find the total straw used for the rats, we subtract the straw used for hamsters and rabbits from the total straw used: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90.

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, we can divide the total straw used for rats by 3 to find the number of straw pieces per cage: 90 / 3 = 30.

Now, we know each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the straw pieces per cage by 6: 30 / 6 = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the interest, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2% or 0.02, and the time is 3 months. We can plug these values into the formula:

Interest = $100 * 0.02 * 3
Interest = $6

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the amount Mandy should give to Benedict:

Amount to be paid = Principal + Interest
Amount to be paid = $100 + $6
Amount to be paid = $106

The final answer is: $106"
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of bags as x.

The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold: 30x.

The total cost is the cost of buying the bags plus the cost of transportation: 20x + 2x = 22x.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost: 400 = 30x - 22x.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 400 = 8x.

To find the number of bags sold, we divide both sides by 8: x = 400 / 8.

x = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total cost of the expenses, we need to calculate the cost of the food and the rides separately and then add them to the cost of the tickets.

The cost of the tickets is given as $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. 

Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50
Cost of food = $15.75

The cost of the rides is $33 per ride, and there are 2 rides. 

Cost of rides = 2 * $33
Cost of rides = $66

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides.

Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total cost = $102

Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, we need to divide the total cost by 3.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3
Cost per person = $102 / 3
Cost per person = $34

The final answer is: $34"
"To calculate the total number of peaches John collects, we can use the formula:

Total peaches = Number of hours * Number of peaches per hour

Given that John collects peaches for 3 hours and can collect 2 peaches per minute, we first need to convert the hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he can collect per minute:

Total peaches = 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute
Total peaches = 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"As an ornithologist specializing in waterfowl behavior, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the daily insect consumption of a flock of ducks.

To find the daily insect requirement, we need to divide the total weekly consumption by 7. 

3.5 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 0.5 pounds/day

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks requires 0.5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Final answer: $\boxed{0.5}$"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left, we need to consider the net change in the number of trees over the 10-year period.

Tom plants 10 trees per year, resulting in a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees. However, he also chops down 2 trees per year, resulting in a net gain of 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, the net gain is 8 * 10 = 80 trees. Initially, Tom had 50 trees. Adding the net gain to the initial number of trees, we get:

50 + 80 = 130 trees

However, 30% of the trees die after 10 years. To find 30% of 130 trees, we multiply 130 by 0.3:

130 * 0.3 = 39 trees

Now, we subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees Tom has:

130 - 39 = 91 trees

The final answer is: 91"
"To determine the number of pink plastic flamingos, we need to calculate the number of flamingos that were left after the neighbors took one third of them back on Saturday.

Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.

On Saturday, the neighbors took one third of the flamingos back, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. So, the number of pink plastic flamingos left is 18 - 6 = 12.

On Sunday, 18 more pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection. So, the total number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white plastic flamingos is 6.

To find the difference between the number of pink plastic flamingos and white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the change Violetta will receive, we need to subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has.

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we need to calculate the cost of one pen first. 

A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. 
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now, we can find the cost of 8 pens. 
Cost of 8 pens = 8 * $1.50 = $12.00

The final answer is $12.00."
"To determine the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can use simple division. 

The total amount of carrots available is 200 pounds, and each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds. To find the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used, we can divide the total amount of carrots available by the number of restaurants and subtract the result from the total amount of carrots available.

200 pounds ÷ 40 restaurants = 5 pounds per restaurant

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

200 pounds - (40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant) = 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds

The final answer is 120."
"To determine the number of children in Soda, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

The total population is 23786, and the sum of men and women is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. 

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
= 23786 - 17509
= 6277

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"To calculate the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to break down her card collection by month.

In the first month, Elaine collected 3 times the number of cards she initially had, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

Now, let's add up the cards from each month: 
20 (initial cards) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Elaine now has 320 Pokémon cards."
"As a copy-editor, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to find the total amount Mark makes in a week. Let's start by finding out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2.

Total sentences = 1000
Sentences per publisher = Total sentences / 2
Sentences per publisher = 1000 / 2
Sentences per publisher = 500

Now, we know that Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. To find the amount Mark earns from Publisher A, we can multiply the number of sentences by the rate:

Amount from Publisher A = Sentences per publisher * Rate per sentence
Amount from Publisher A = 500 * 5 cents
Amount from Publisher A = 2500 cents

Since Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount Mark earns from Publisher A by 2:

Amount from Publisher B = Amount from Publisher A * 2
Amount from Publisher B = 2500 * 2
Amount from Publisher B = 5000 cents

To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amounts he earns from both publishers:

Total amount = Amount from Publisher A + Amount from Publisher B
Total amount = 2500 + 5000
Total amount = 7500 cents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7500}$"
"To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to consider the amount of water he receives in the morning and the amount he receives in the afternoon.

Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate the total amount of water he gets in the morning and the afternoon as follows:

Morning: 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters
Afternoon: 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters

Total water per day: 25 liters + 30 liters = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: 55"

"As a viticulturist specializing in grape cultivation, I can provide a precise calculation for the number of barrels of wine produced on Josie's farm.

To determine the total number of barrels of wine produced, we need to multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes produced per acre and then by the barrels of wine produced per ton.

Let's break it down:

Number of acres: 10
Grapes per acre: 5 tons
Wine per ton: 2 barrels

Total tons of grapes: 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons
Total barrels of wine: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider the slices used for each meal and add them together.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. So, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.

For breakfast, Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet. So, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.

For dinner, Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up the slices of cheese Carl used: 14 (lunch) + 9 (breakfast) + 8 (dinner) = 31 slices of cheese.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$"

Janet now has 98 pens."
"To find the required score for Brinley's sixth test, we need to consider the average of the six tests. Since she can remove the lowest score, we'll first find the total score of the first five tests and then determine the required score for the sixth test.

The sum of the first five test scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. To find the average, we divide this sum by 5, which gives us 438 / 5 = 87.6.

Since Brinley wants an average of 93, we need to find the total score for six tests. We multiply the desired average by 6: 93 * 6 = 558.

Now, we subtract the total score of the first five tests from the desired total score: 558 - 438 = 120.

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final answer is 120."
"To calculate the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first period and the second period.

In the first period, Micheal rode 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This can be calculated as 5 * 4 = 20 times. Since he rode 25 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 20 * 25 = 500 kilometers.

In the second period, Micheal rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks. This can be calculated as 2 * 3 = 6 times. Since he rode 60 kilometers each time, the total kilometers for this period is 6 * 60 = 360 kilometers.

The total number of kilometers Micheal rode is the sum of the kilometers from both periods: 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{860}$"
"To calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to consider the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately.

Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars can be calculated as:

25 * 40g = 1000g

Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, which is 40g / 2 = 20g. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

80 * 20g = 1600g

Now, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of the bag of candy:

1000g + 1600g = 2600g

The final answer is: $\boxed{2600}$"
"To calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of cakes she bought on Monday as M, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday as T, and the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday as W.

We know that M = 4 (given).
T = 3M = 3(4) = 12 (since she bought three times the number of cakes on Monday)
W = 5T = 5(12) = 60 (since she bought five times the number of cakes on Tuesday)

Now, let's add the number of cakes she bought each day:
Total = M + T + W = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"To calculate the cost of each cup, we can start by finding the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since there are 6 plates in a dozen, half a dozen plates will be 3 plates. The cost of 3 plates is 3 * $6000 = $18000.

Now, we know that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of 20 dozen cups is $18000 - $1200 = $16800.

Since there are 12 cups in a dozen, 20 dozen cups will be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of 20 dozen cups by the number of cups. 

Cost per cup = $16800 / 240 cups = $70.

The final answer is: $70"
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the number of lawn mowing sessions as x.

The total amount Sara needs to earn is $50 (jacket and shoes) - $10 (initial savings) = $40.

Since she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, we can set up the equation: 4x = 40.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4: x = 40 / 4.

x = 10

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to earn the required amount.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's dive into the world of poultry farming and crack the code of the chicken egg production problem.

We're given that Jerry has a flock of chickens, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs collected is 42. We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's use variables to represent the number of red chickens (r) and white chickens (w). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can express this as w = r + 2.

The total number of eggs collected can be represented by the equation: 3r + 5w = 42. Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Expanding the equation, we get:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42

Combine like terms:

8r + 10 = 42

Subtract 10 from both sides:

8r = 32

Divide both sides by 8:

r = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To calculate the time Gary spends walking around the edge of the local park, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since the park is a rectangle, we add the lengths of all four sides:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
Perimeter = 2(1.5 + 6)
Perimeter = 2(7.5)
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now, we divide the perimeter by Gary's walking speed to find the time he spends walking:

Time = Perimeter / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as x. Since Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day, the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.

The total number of customers on the first two days is x + (x + 50), and we know this equals 250. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 50) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

2x = 200

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 100

Now that we know the number of customers on the first day (x = 100), we can find the number of customers on the second day (x + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150).

To find the number of customers on the third day, we know the total number of customers on the third day is 500. We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 50) + (number of customers on the third day) = 500

Substitute x = 100:

100 + 150 + (number of customers on the third day) = 500

Combine like terms:

250 + (number of customers on the third day) = 500

Subtract 250 from both sides:

(number of customers on the third day) = 250

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

250"
"Let's dive into the problem of finding the amount of water in the small pool.

We know that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons/minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as x gallons. Then, the big pool had 2x gallons of water four minutes ago.

Since both pools have been leaking for 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool has lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool now as y gallons. Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water now.

We can set up the equation: 2x - 16 = 4y.

We also know that the small pool lost 16 gallons of water, so it now has x - 16 gallons of water. We are given that the small pool has y gallons of water now, so we can set up the equation: x - 16 = y.

We can solve the system of equations by substituting 2x - 16 for 4y in the first equation: 2x - 16 = 2(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 2x - 32. This equation is true for all values of x, so we need to use the second equation to find the value of x.

Substituting x - 16 for y in the equation 2x - 16 = 4y, we get 2x - 16 = 4(x - 16). Simplifying, we get 2x - 16 = 4x - 64. Adding 64 to both sides, we get 2x + 48 = 4x. Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 48 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 24.

Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the equation x - 16 = y: 24 - 16 = y, so y = 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we can use the following calculation:

Total cost of items = $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00

$352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to make her purchase.

Final answer: 44"
"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we need to determine the total amount she borrowed and the total amount she will pay.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional amount is calculated as 10% of $2000, which is 0.1 * $2000 = $200.

The total amount Janeth needs to pay is $2000 (initial amount) + $200 (additional amount) = $2200.

Since she is paying $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate the total amount she will pay as $165 * 12 = $1980.

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount she needs to pay to find the remaining balance.

Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total amount paid
= $2200 - $1980
= $220

The final answer is: $220"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we can use basic arithmetic. 

We know there are 4 roses and 7 more dahlias than roses. Let's represent the number of dahlias as 4 + 7, which equals 11. 

The total number of flowers is the sum of roses and dahlias: 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the average age of the three individuals in three years, we need to first determine their current ages.

Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age as 2 * 21 = 42 years.

Next, we can calculate Adrian's age, which is three times the age of Harriet: 3 * 21 = 63 years.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack: 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years

The average age of the three in three years will be (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored.

Let's denote Naomi's points as N, Yuri's points as Y, Brianna's points as B, and Jojo's points as J. We know that N = 68.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
Y = (1/2)N + 10
Y = (1/2)(68) + 10
Y = 34 + 10
Y = 44

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. 
B = N + 17
B = 68 + 17
B = 85

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
N + Y + B = 68 + 44 + 85
= 197

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total points.
J = 251 - (N + Y + B)
J = 251 - 197
J = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles, we can use the following formula:

Time = (Number of crossword puzzles * Time per crossword puzzle) + (Number of sudoku puzzles * Time per sudoku puzzle)

Given that Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles, and it takes her 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = (3 * 10) + (8 * 5)
Time = 30 + 40
Time = 70

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

"Let's dive into the problem of determining the amount of water in the tank after Celine's actions.

We know that the tank initially contains 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters for her garden, leaving 120 - 90 = 30 liters in the tank.

Next, she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. This means she collected 2 * 30 = 60 liters of rainwater.

To find the total amount of water in the tank now, we add the remaining water to the collected rainwater: 30 + 60 = 90 liters.

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

Final answer: 90"
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias.

The number of geraniums is given as 90. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, the number of petunias can be calculated as:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
= 90 - 40
= 50

Now, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the number of geraniums and petunias:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
= 90 + 50
= 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we need to find the sum of the amounts spent in each year.

The company spent $15,000 in the first year. 
A third of that amount is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000.

The total amount spent in the first year is $15,000. 
The total amount spent in the second year is $5,000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.

"To calculate the total number of days for the round trip, we need to consider the time taken for each leg of the journey.

The bus trip from New Jersey to Rochester takes 6 days. Since the return trip is by car, which takes half as many days as the bus trip, the car trip from Rochester to New Jersey will take 6 / 2 = 3 days.

To find the total number of days for the round trip, we add the days for each leg: 6 (bus trip) + 3 (car trip) = 9 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card, we need to first find the total number of cards James has. 

He starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 
Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

He loses 8 water type cards, so the new number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so the new number of grass type cards is 20 + 14 = 34.

Now, the total number of cards is 90 - 8 + 14 = 96.

The number of water type cards is 32.

The percentage chance of picking a water type card is (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's meal, we need to consider the individual components and their respective costs.

The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding the extra meat for $2.00, the total becomes $6.50 + $2.00 = $8.50. Then, adding the extra cheese for $1.00, the total is $8.50 + $1.00 = $9.50. Next, adding the avocado for $1.00, the total is $9.50 + $1.00 = $10.50. Finally, adding the 2 sauces for $0.50 each, the total is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00. 

The upgrade for $3.00 adds to the total, making it $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. However, Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract this from the total, resulting in $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To determine the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of piece placement.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

To find the time it will take to complete the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

Time = Total Pieces / Combined Rate
Time = 360 / 6
Time = 60 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 60:

Time (in hours) = 60 minutes / 60
Time (in hours) = 1 hour

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To determine the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we need to calculate the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn's initial harvest and then find 3/4 of the remaining watermelons.

Initially, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we calculate 30% of 120.

30% of 120 = 0.3 * 120 = 36

The remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest. To find the number of watermelons ready for harvest, we calculate 3/4 of 84.

3/4 of 84 = 0.75 * 84 = 63

Now, to find the number of watermelons not ready for harvest, we subtract the number of watermelons ready for harvest from the total remaining watermelons.

Watermelons not ready for harvest = 84 - 63 = 21

The final answer is: $\boxed{21}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the vehicles, taxes, and registration fees.

The cost of the cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the price per car: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.

The tax on the cars is 10% of the total cost, which can be calculated as 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

The registration fees for the cars are $1,000 per car, so for 12 cars, it would be 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the cars, taxes, and registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

The final answer is: $276,000"
"To determine the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we can follow a straightforward approach. 

First, we know that Robert collects 20 shells on Monday. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, we can express this as an equation: K = R + 5, where K represents the number of shells Kylie collects and R represents the number of shells Robert collects. Substituting the given value, we get K = 20 + 5 = 25.

Next, we are told that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. This can be expressed as K_Tuesday = 2 * K, where K_Tuesday represents the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday. Substituting the value of K, we get K_Tuesday = 2 * 25 = 50.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the number of ants as A and the number of bugs as B. We are given that the number of bugs is half the number of ants, so B = A/2.

We are also given that the number of ants is 50, so A = 50.

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation B = A/2 to find the number of bugs:

B = 50/2
B = 25

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and bugs:

Total number of insects = A + B
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"To determine the number of penguins left sunbathing, we need to calculate the number of penguins that left and subtract it from the initial number of penguins.

One-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that jumped in the ocean.
Another one-third of 36 penguins is 36 / 3 = 12 penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner.

The total number of penguins that left is 12 + 12 = 24 penguins.

To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that left from the initial number of penguins: 36 - 24 = 12.

Therefore, the number of penguins left sunbathing is 12.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we can start by calculating the total number of tomatoes required per week. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, and he eats 6 tomatoes per day, we can calculate his weekly consumption as follows:

Steve's weekly consumption = 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

His girlfriend's weekly consumption = 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Total weekly consumption = Steve's consumption + girlfriend's consumption = 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by 3 to find the number of vines needed:

Number of vines = Total weekly consumption / 3 = 63 tomatoes/week / 3 = 21 vines/week

To account for the fact that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can multiply the number of vines by 2:

Number of vines = 2 * 21 vines/week = 42 vines/week

However, this calculation assumes that the vines will produce tomatoes at a constant rate. In reality, vine production can be affected by factors such as weather, soil quality, and pruning. To be on the safe side, it's best to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Steve has enough tomatoes.

Final answer: $\boxed{43}$"
"To determine the number of pizzas John needs to order, we can use the following calculation:

Number of slices needed = Total number of friends * Slices per friend
= 20 * 4
= 80 slices

Since pizzas are sold in 8 slices, we can divide the total number of slices needed by 8 to find the number of pizzas:

Number of pizzas = Total number of slices needed / Slices per pizza
= 80 / 8
= 10

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"Let's dive into the world of pen economics. As someone who appreciates the beauty of blue, I'll focus on the mathematical aspect of the problem.

Ram starts with 25 pens and can make one full pen from the ink of 5 empty pens. To find out how many full pens he can make, we can divide the total number of pens by 5.

25 pens ÷ 5 pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Since Ram already has 25 pens, we need to add the 5 full pens he can make to the original 25 pens.

25 (original pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30 pens

So, Ram will have a total of 30 pens.

The final answer is: 30"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find the final amount of money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow the steps:

1. Johnny started with $20 and added $10, so the total amount is $20 + $10 = $30.
2. The money tripled in a year, so we multiply the total amount by 3: $30 * 3 = $90.

The final answer is: $90"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Jessa is 20 years old. Since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Now, we know that Mary is 2 years younger than Joan. So, we can calculate Mary's age as follows:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

To find the sum of their ages, we can add their individual ages:

Sum of their ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of their ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of their ages = 68

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit A. This can be calculated as 30% of the total number of students, which is 1000.

Number of students who went out through exit A = 30% of 1000
= (30/100) * 1000
= 0.3 * 1000
= 300 students

Next, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
= 1000 - 300
= 700 students

Now, we need to find the number of students who went out through exit B. This can be calculated as 3/5 of the remaining students.

Number of students who went out through exit B = (3/5) * 700
= (3/5) * 700
= 420 students

Finally, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students to find the number of students who went out through exit C.

Number of students who went out through exit C = Remaining students - Students who went out through exit B
= 700 - 420
= 280 students

The number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of candies each person has.

Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as R, James has as J, and John has as N. We know that:

1. John has twice as many candies as Robert: N = 2R
2. James has 6 more candies than Robert: J = R + 6
3. John has 54 candies: N = 54

We can substitute the first equation into the third equation to find the value of R:

2R = 54
R = 54 ÷ 2
R = 27

Now that we know Robert has 27 candies, we can find James' total by adding 6:

J = R + 6
J = 27 + 6
J = 33

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract James' total from John's total:

N - J = 54 - 33
N - J = 21

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is: 21"
"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we can use a simple addition problem. 

Dolly has 2 books and will read 2 books from Pandora's book, so she will read a total of 2 + 2 = 4 books.

Pandora has 1 book and will read 1 book from Dolly's book, so she will read a total of 1 + 1 = 2 books.

The total number of books they will collectively read is 4 (Dolly's books) + 2 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

The final answer is 6."
"To calculate the total time Mike spends writing per week, we need to consider the number of pages he writes and his writing speed.

Since Mike writes 30 pages per week and can write a page every 6 minutes, we can calculate the total time spent writing as follows:

Time = Total pages * Time per page
Time = 30 pages * 6 minutes/page
Time = 180 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
Time = 180 minutes / 60
Time = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing per week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"Let's break down Jason's phone plan usage to determine the remaining minutes.

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. He has a daily 15-minute call with his boss, which amounts to 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes. Additionally, he has used 300 extra minutes for calls to other people.

To find the remaining minutes, we subtract the total minutes used from the total minutes in his plan:

1000 minutes (plan) - 450 minutes (used for his boss) - 300 minutes (used for other people) = 250 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 250 minutes left in his phone plan this month."
"To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach to determine the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin.

Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin as x.

Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. This left Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

After Ginger gave Griffin x fries, Griffin had 9 + x fries.

Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. Griffin was left with 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries.

We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, so we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get x = 20.

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer: 20"
"Let's dive into the world of aquariums and snails. As a marine biologist, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We have two aquariums, one with 4 snails and the other with 32 snails. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

Since the difference between the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

This means there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: 14"
"As a makeup artist specializing in film and television productions, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.

To calculate the total amount paid, we need to consider the total hours worked and apply the discount. 

First, let's calculate the total hours worked: 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, the total hours worked is 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours.

Next, we calculate the total cost without discount: 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000.

To apply the 10% discount, we calculate 10% of $30,000: 0.1 * $30,000 = $3,000.

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

The final answer is: $27,000"

Total Cost = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the onions."
"To determine the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister, we need to calculate the total calories from each of their cookie consumption.

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. The total number of cookies eaten by Sue is 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

The total calories from cookies are given as 200 calories per cookie. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. The total calories consumed by her sister is 5 * 200 + 13 * 200 = 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5600}$"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can start by finding the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, and there are 3 classes, the total number of girls is 50% of 3 classes, which is 1.5 classes.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of girls is 1.5 * 20 = 30 girls.

We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

This means that the third class has 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys, the number of boys in the school is also 30. 

Since there are 3 classes, the number of boys in each class is 30 / 3 = 10 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Rick's hunting expedition can be analyzed using basic arithmetic operations. We'll start by identifying the number of wolves and cougars he killed each day.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed 15 cougars, he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves.

Today, he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals Rick killed:

Total wolves = 10 (last night) + 45 (today) = 55 wolves
Total cougars = 15 (last night) + 12 (today) = 27 cougars

The total number of animals Rick killed is the sum of wolves and cougars: 55 + 27 = 82.

"To determine the floor Bill is on now, we can use a simple mathematical equation. 

Bill's current floor is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

Let's represent Bill's starting floor as 'x'. The equation would be: 

4x + 6

Since Bill starts on the 3rd floor, we can substitute x with 3:

4(3) + 6

First, multiply 4 and 3:
12 + 6

Now, add 12 and 6:
18

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"To determine the number of times Robert went down the water slide, we need to calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide first. 

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30.

30% of 30 is 0.3 * 30 = 9. 
So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. 
So, Robert went down the slide 4 * 21 = 84 times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{84}$"
"Let's dive into the problem at hand. We have 10 stalls with 20 cows each, and Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. To find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we need to calculate the total number of cows first.

The total number of cows in 20 stalls is 20 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 400 cows. After Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows, the total number of cows becomes 400 cows + 40 cows = 440 cows.

Since the cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, we can divide the total number of cows by 20 to find the number of cows in each stall: 440 cows / 20 stalls = 22 cows/stall.

Now, to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in each stall by 8: 22 cows/stall * 8 stalls = 176 cows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{176}$"

- 40 nickels = 40 x $0.05 = $2
- 20 dimes = 20 x $0.10 = $2
- 40 dollar bills = 40 x $1 = $40

Now, let's add the values together: $1 + $2 + $2 + $40 = $45

Therefore, Brady has a total of $45 in his piggy bank."
"To calculate the total weight of the redwood, we need to first determine the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate this as follows:

Weight of wood eaten by termites = Total weight of redwood * 0.30
Weight of wood eaten by termites = 8000 pounds * 0.30
Weight of wood eaten by termites = 2400 pounds

Now, we can subtract the weight of the wood that was eaten by the termites from the total weight of the redwood to find the weight of the remaining wood:

Weight of remaining wood = Total weight of redwood - Weight of wood eaten by termites
Weight of remaining wood = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
Weight of remaining wood = 5600 pounds

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds.

Final answer: 5600"
"To calculate the total amount Nancy owes, we need to consider the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee for having at least one book over a week overdue. 

The cost of the overdue books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book: 8 books * $0.50 per book = $4.00.

Adding the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book over a week overdue, we get: $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Therefore, Nancy owes a total of $6.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Since Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up an equation to represent the number of apples Jamal has:

Let x be the number of apples Jamal has.
Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Andrea has x + 8 apples.
We are given that Andrea has 52 apples, so we can set up the equation: x + 8 = 52.

To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
x = 52 - 8
x = 44

Now that we know Jamal has 44 apples, we can find out how many bananas he has. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, we can set up the equation:
Let y be the number of bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so y = x + 4.
We know x = 44, so y = 44 + 4 = 48.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find out how many bananas Andrea has by dividing 48 by 2:
Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have:
Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)
= (52 + 24) + (44 + 48)
= 76 + 92
= 168

The final answer is: $\boxed{168}$"
"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we can calculate the total number of cookies and then divide by 12, as 2 cups of flour are required for a dozen cookies.

Total number of cookies = 36 (today) + 30 (tomorrow) = 66 cookies

Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by 12:

66 cookies / 12 = 5.5 cups

Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we can use the following calculation:

(2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200

Since each penny is worth $0.01, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of each penny:

6,200 * $0.01 = $62

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is $62.

Final Answer: The final answer is $62."
"To calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has, we can use the formula for multiplication and addition.

First, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box: 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles Maddison received from her friend: 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles.

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To determine the number of trees in each yard, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of trees in Chris's yard as C, the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard as F, and the number of trees in Harry's yard as H.

We know that C = 6 (Chris has 6 trees).

Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so F = C / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so H = 2F + 5 = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11.

To find the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees in Ferdinand's yard from the number of trees in Harry's yard:

H - F = 11 - 3 = 8

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have three variables: Carmen's money (C), Samantha's money (S), and Daisy's money (D). We know that:

1. C = $100
2. S = C + $25
3. D = S + $50

We can substitute the value of C into the equation for S: S = $100 + $25 = $125.

Now, substitute the value of S into the equation for D: D = $125 + $50 = $175.

To find the total amount of money the girls have, we add up the amounts: C + S + D = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The final answer is: $400"
"To calculate the total price of the house, we need to consider the additional fees associated with the purchase. 

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is 0.05 x $350,000 = $17,500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $350,000 = $42,000.

The total additional fees are $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500. Adding this to the selling price gives us a total price of $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500.

Since Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000, the difference is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500.

The final answer is: $9,500"
"To calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to consider the total amount he paid and subtract it from the selling price.

The selling price of the house is $400,000. Mr. Tan paid 3% of the selling price in transfer fees, which is $12,000. He also paid a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price, which is $20,000. Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

To find the net proceeds, we need to calculate the total amount paid and subtract it from the selling price.

Total amount paid = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
= $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
= $282,000

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total amount paid
= $400,000 - $282,000
= $118,000

The final answer is: $118,000"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes to heat up the oil and the time it takes to cook the chicken.

The time to heat up the oil is given as 20 minutes. To heat up the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes. 

40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
Time to heat up the oil to 400 degrees = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

The time to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm up the oil. 
Time to cook the chicken = 28 - 5 = 23 minutes

Total time = Time to heat up the oil + Time to cook the chicken
Total time = 28 + 23 = 51 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{51}$"
"As a real estate agent, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with the ads. To calculate the total amount spent, we need to consider both the newspaper and television ads.

The cost of newspaper ads can be calculated by multiplying the cost per ad ($5) by the number of ads (50): 
$5 * 50 = $250

Similarly, the cost of television ads can be calculated by multiplying the cost per ad ($75) by the number of ads (15): 
$75 * 15 = $1125

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the cost of newspaper ads and television ads: 
$250 + $1125 = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"As a color connoisseur, I can confidently say that the number of blue golf balls is half of the total number of golf balls. Since the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total, and half of them are golf balls, we can calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

Number of golf balls = Total number of balls / 2
= 16 / 2
= 8

Since half of the golf balls are blue, we can calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

Number of blue golf balls = Number of golf balls / 2
= 8 / 2
= 4

Therefore, the correct answer is 4 blue golf balls."
"To calculate the total number of M&Ms, we need to consider the number of M&Ms in each bag. 

The first bag contains 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add the number of M&Ms in each bag: 
300 + 312 + 150 = 762

The total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"To calculate the total number of windows, we need to consider the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms. 

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms: 
2 houses * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows per bedroom = 12 windows

Next, we calculate the total number of additional windows not connected to bedrooms: 
2 houses * 4 additional windows per house = 8 windows

Now, we add the total number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to find the total number of windows: 
12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows

"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the items from the amount paid. 

The total cost is $14.99. The amount paid is $20. 

$20 - $14.99 = $5.01

The cashier gives the mother $5.01 in change."
"To determine the number of stitches for each sleeve, we can start by finding the total number of stitches for the collar and rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 stitches. 

The collar takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches.

Now, we know that the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We also know that the body takes 900 stitches, the collar takes 90 stitches, and the rosette takes 180 stitches. 

To find the number of stitches for the two sleeves, we subtract the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches for the sweater:
1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
630 / 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.

The final answer is 315."
"As a botanist specializing in horticulture, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Mrs. Rylan's seed purchase can be broken down into two components: the cost of tomato seeds and the cost of celery seeds. To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet for each type of seed.

The cost of the tomato seeds: 20 packets * $40/packet = $800
The cost of the celery seeds: 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information provided.

The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which is 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up the lines from the song and both scenes: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

The final answer is: $\boxed{138}$"
"To determine the number of cards with the letter D, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of cards with the letter A: 2/5 * 80 = 32.

Next, we subtract the cards with A from the total: 80 - 32 = 48.

Then, we find the number of cards with the letter B: 1/2 * 48 = 24.

Now, we subtract the cards with B from the remaining: 48 - 24 = 24.

We then find the number of cards with the letter C: 5/8 * 24 = 15.

Finally, we subtract the cards with C from the remaining: 24 - 15 = 9.

Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig holes, we need to consider the time it takes to dig small holes and large holes separately. 

The time it takes to dig a small hole is 3 minutes, and the time it takes to dig a large hole is 10 minutes. 

The total time for small holes is 30 holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes. 
The total time for large holes is 15 holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.

The total time is the sum of these two: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 240 minutes / 60 = 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we need to consider their current ages. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. Let's assume their current ages are x and y. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that in 10 years, their ages will be x + 10 and y + 10. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be (x + 10) + (y + 10) = x + y + 20.

Since x + y = 20, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + 20 = 20 + 20
x + y + 20 = 40

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

Final Answer: The final answer is 40."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write another equation:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expanding the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtracting 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtracting 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Dividing both sides by 3:
S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"

"As a jewelry expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts. To find the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace, we need to calculate the total space between the topaz gemstones and then divide it by the length of each bead.

The total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches, and the total length of the necklace is 25 inches. The space between the gemstones can be found by subtracting the length of the gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches (total length) - 8 inches (topaz gemstones) = 17 inches

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we can divide the total space between the gemstones (17 inches) by the length of each bead (1/4 inch) to find the number of beads used:

17 inches ÷ (1/4 inch) = 17 x 4 = 68

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can break down the total number of stars into the given row configurations.

We know that there are 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars. Let's calculate the total number of stars in these rows:

3 rows of 8 stars: 3 * 8 = 24 stars
2 rows of 6 stars: 2 * 6 = 12 stars

Total stars in these rows: 24 + 12 = 36 stars

Since the flag has 76 stars, the remaining stars are 76 - 36 = 40 stars. These 40 stars are distributed in rows of 5 stars.

To find the number of rows of 5 stars, we can divide the remaining stars by 5:

40 stars / 5 stars per row = 8 rows

Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we can use the following calculation:

Total weight of flagstones = Number of flagstones * Weight per flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone
Total weight of flagstones = 6000 pounds

Since each truck has a capacity of 2000 pounds, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trucks needed:

Number of trucks = Total weight of flagstones / Truck capacity
Number of trucks = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck
Number of trucks = 3

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Given that the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can determine the speed of the car in the slow lane as 60 / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

Now, we can calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
Time = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"As a counter expert, I can analyze the problem and provide a solution.

Let's break down the information given:

Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, which means Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Since the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times more than the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together, we can set up the equation: 10x = 39, where x represents the total number of medals given out.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: x = 39 / 10.

x = 3.9

The total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9."
"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars available and then divide them equally among the children.

There are 4 adults and 8 children, making a total of 12 people. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, resulting in a total of 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.

The adults will receive 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars. To find the remaining chocolate bars, we subtract the number given to adults from the total: 40 - 24 = 16.

Now, we divide the remaining 16 chocolate bars among the 8 children. This can be calculated as 16 / 8 = 2.

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate Susan's earnings, we need to determine the total number of minutes she works and then divide that by 10 to find out how many $5 intervals she completes.

Since she works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours, we can calculate the total minutes she works as follows:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract that from the total minutes she works:

180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

Now, we can divide the total minutes by 10 to find out how many $5 intervals she completes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 per interval, we can multiply the number of intervals by the earnings per interval:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.

The final answer is $75."

Day 2:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's add the total count of each activity:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

Total count of activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner). So, the total amount of rice consumed per person per day is 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed per day is 0.4 kg * 5 = 2 kg.

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is 2 kg * 7 = 14 kg.

Now, we can divide the total amount of rice (42 kg) by the amount consumed per week (14 kg) to find out how many weeks it will last:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks

The rice will last for 3 weeks.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the number of crates Sam was short of his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates sold and subtract it from the target.

Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. To find the total number of crates sold, we can add these values:

20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65

Since Sam's target was 120 crates, we can subtract the total number of crates sold from the target to find the difference:

120 - 65 = 55

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week."
"To determine the final cost of the desk, we can analyze the bidding process step by step. 

The initial bid was $200. Since there were 3 other bidders, the bids rose by $50 each time. This means the bids increased by a total of $150 ($50 x 3). 

The sequence of bids is as follows:
- Initial bid: $200
- Second bid: $200 + $150 = $350
- Third bid: $350 + $150 = $500
- Fourth bid: $500 + $150 = $650
- Fifth bid: $650 + $150 = $800
- Sixth bid: $800 + $150 = $950
- Seventh bid: $950 + $150 = $1100
- Eighth bid: $1100 + $150 = $1250

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she bids $350, $500, and $650. 

The final bid was $1250.

The final answer is: $1250"
"To calculate the total cost of driving for John, we need to consider both the mileage-based cost and the monthly bonus.

The total distance driven per year is 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year. At a cost of $2 per mile, the total cost of driving is 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000.

Additionally, John receives a $150 monthly bonus, which amounts to $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800 per year.

The total cost of driving per year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

The final answer is: $31,800"
"To determine the time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we can calculate the difference between his desired exercise time and the combined time he exercised on Monday and Sunday.

Desired exercise time = 2 x (Monday's exercise time + Sunday's exercise time)
= 2 x (16 + 23)
= 2 x 39
= 78 minutes

Since Peter wants to exercise for 78 minutes, we can calculate the additional time he needs to exercise on Tuesday.

Additional time needed = Desired exercise time - Combined exercise time
= 78 - 39
= 39 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid, we can analyze the pattern of page placement. 

When folding a tabloid, each side has an equal number of pages. Since the pages are arranged in pairs, we can pair the pages as follows: (1-2), (3-4), ..., (31-32). This pairing results in 16 pairs of pages.

Since each pair consists of two pages, we can calculate the total number of pieces of paper needed by multiplying the number of pairs by 2.

Number of pieces of paper = 2 * 16
= 32

However, this calculation assumes that each pair of pages is printed on two separate pieces of paper. In reality, the pages are printed on the same piece of paper, with the first page of each pair on the left side and the second page on the right side.

Therefore, the actual number of pieces of paper needed is equal to the number of pairs, which is 16.

The correct answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the remaining amount of money Annika has, we need to subtract the total money she spent from the initial amount she brought.

Annika initially brought $50. She spent $25 on food and snacks and an additional $10 on rides. The total money spent is $25 + $10 = $35.

To find the remaining amount, we subtract the total money spent from the initial amount:

$50 - $35 = $15

Annika has $15 left.

Final answer: $15"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we can use the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Elise sold 45 books this year and that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. This means she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

We also know that the total number of books is 250, and there are 50 unsold books. So, the total number of books sold in the first two years is 250 - 50 = 200.

Since we know the number of books sold in the first year (90) and the total number of books sold in the first two years (200), we can find the number of books sold in the second year: 200 - 90 = 110.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year by multiplying the number of books sold (110) by the price per book (20$: 110 * 20 = 2200.

The final answer is: $2200"
"As a financial analyst specializing in hourly wage calculations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Watson's earnings for April.

To calculate Watson's total earnings for the month, we need to consider his daily earnings and the weekly bonus. Since Watson works 10 hours a day, five days a week, his daily earnings are:

10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since April has 30 days, his total earnings for the month would be:
$100/day * 30 days = $3000

Additionally, he gets a $300 bonus for the whole month, so his total earnings for April would be:
$3000 + $300 = $3300

The final answer is: $3300"
"To determine the number of people John lost to, we can calculate 20 x 0.2 (since 80% is equivalent to 0.8).

20 x 0.2 = 4

John lost to 4 people."
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the total loaves are sold in the morning, which can be expressed as:

(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Next, we find the number of loaves left after the morning sales:

60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Since half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, we divide the remaining loaves by 2:

(1/2) * 20 = 10 loaves

As the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in each period is 10 / 2 = 5 loaves.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to analyze the rate at which Joey loses weight.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses per week, we can divide 8 by 4.

8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Since Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, and Joey loses 2 pounds per week, we can set up a proportion to find the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds.

Let x be the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds. We can set up the proportion:

2 pounds/week = 8 pounds / x weeks

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 8 / 2

x = 4

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

Final Answer: The final answer is 4."
"To calculate the savings, we need to find the difference between the original cost and the discounted cost.

Original cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $13 = $26
Original cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total original cost: $26 + $2 = $28

Discounted cost of 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 x $11 = $22
Discounted cost of 4 packets of milk: 4 x $0.5 = $2
Total discounted cost: $22 + $2 = $24

Savings: $28 - $24 = $4

The final answer is: $4"
"As a renowned expert in the field of regenerative biology, I can provide a detailed analysis of the Lots-of-Limbs Serum's effects.

The serum's dosing schedule is based on a periodic growth pattern, where the individual grows an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. To determine the total number of new limbs after 15 days, we can calculate the number of complete growth cycles and any remaining days.

In 15 days, there are 5 complete cycles of 3 days (15 ÷ 3 = 5). This means the individual will grow 5 extra arms.

For the legs, there are 3 complete cycles of 5 days (15 ÷ 5 = 3) and 0 remaining days. Therefore, the individual will grow 3 extra legs.

The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and legs: 5 + 3 = 8.

Final answer: 8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased and subtract that from his total budget.

The cost of 6 business suits is 6 * $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. Therefore, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.

The total cost of items purchased so far is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo's total budget is $6000, and he wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left to spend on gifts.

The final answer is: $4000"
"To calculate the total number of eggs consumed in a week, we need to consider the daily egg consumption of the family members.

There are 5 family members in total. Three people eat 3 eggs each day, while the remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day. 

Let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day:
- 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume 3 x 3 = 9 eggs per day.
- 2 people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume 2 x 2 = 4 eggs per day.

Total eggs consumed per day = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is 13 x 7 = 91 eggs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{91}$"
"To determine Trent's age, we can use the given information:

Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. We can express this as an equation:

Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3
Jane's age = 27

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can express this as another equation:

Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5
Trent's age = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{32}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the current population of Chile as P and Noah's current age as N.

We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, and Cera is currently 46 years old. So, six years ago, Noah was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago
3000 * 40 = P - 6 (since the population six years ago was half of the current population)

Now, we can solve for P:

3000 * 40 = P - 6
120,000 = P - 6
P = 120,000 + 6
P = 120,006

The current population of Chile is 120,006.

The final answer is: 120,006"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to represent the relationships between the number of players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'x'. 

Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We know that the total number of players is 105. 

We can write the equation: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 
2x + 4x + x = 210
Combine like terms: 7x = 210
Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

Final Answer: The final answer is 30."
"To determine the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we need to calculate the total number of people invited and subtract those who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments.

First, let's calculate the total number of people invited. There are 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people. Additionally, there are 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people. The total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24.

Since 8 people couldn't come due to illness, we subtract 8 from the total number of people invited: 24 - 8 = 16.

1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments, which is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

Now, we subtract the people with previous commitments from the total number of people who were supposed to come: 16 - 2 = 14.

Therefore, 14 people show up for Martha's party.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To calculate the total weight of marbles, we need to follow these steps:

Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. His father then gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

First, we find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. 2/5 of 20 is (2/5) * 20 = 8. So, Solomon's father gave him 8 marbles. The total number of marbles is 20 (bought) + 8 (given by father) = 28 marbles.

Next, we add the marbles from the store to the marbles Solomon bought and his father gave him. The total number of marbles is 50 (in the store) + 28 (bought and given) = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2kgs, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble to find the total weight. Total weight = 78 marbles * 2kgs = 156kgs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{156}$"
"To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we need to determine the volume of the pool first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (such as a pool) is:

Volume = Length x Width x Depth

Given the dimensions of the pool: Length = 6 feet, Width = 4 feet, and Depth = 5 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool would be:

Total Cost = Volume x Cost per cubic foot
Total Cost = 120 cubic feet x $0.1 per cubic foot
Total Cost = $12

The final answer is: $12"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we can use the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys. Since there are 30 boys, the number of girls can be calculated as 3 * 30 = 90.

We also know that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys. So, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.

Now, we can find the total number of children by adding the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The final answer is: $\boxed{123}$"
"To determine the number of electric poles required, we can use the ratio of electric poles to electric wires. The given ratio is 1:3, which means for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is needed.

Let's denote the number of electric wires as W and the number of electric poles as P. We can set up a proportion based on the given ratio:

W : P = 3 : 1

We are given that the total number of electric wires (W) is 45. We can substitute this value into the proportion:

45 : P = 3 : 1

To solve for P, we can cross-multiply:

45 × 1 = 3 × P

45 = 3P

Now, divide both sides by 3:

P = 45 ÷ 3

P = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can use the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that 1/4 of the total number of people left, and 22 men stayed. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the total number of people at the party.

Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, the number of people who left is (1/4)x. We also know that 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is (1/4)x - 22.

We are also given that the number of women who left is 7. Since the total number of people who left is (1/4)x, we can set up the equation:

(1/4)x = 7 (number of women who left) + (number of men who left)

Substituting (1/4)x - 22 for the number of men who left, we get:

(1/4)x = 7 + (1/4)x - 22

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation:

(1/4)x - (1/4)x = 7 - 22
0 = -15

This equation doesn't make sense, as it implies that 0 equals -15. This is a contradiction, indicating that our initial assumption is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. We know that 22 men stayed, and 1/4 of the total number of people left. We can set up a new equation:

(3/4)x = 22 (number of men who stayed)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4/3:

x = 22 * (4/3)
x = 88/3
x = 29.33

Since x represents the total number of people, it must be a whole number. However, we can round x to the nearest whole number, as we can't have a fraction of a person.

x ≈ 30

Now that we know the total number of people, we can find the number of women who left:

Number of women who left = (1/4)x
= (1/4)(30)
= 7.5

However, we are given that 7 women left. This discrepancy suggests that our initial assumption about the number of women who left might be incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem.

We know that 22 men stayed, and 1/4 of the total number of people left. We can set up a new equation:

(3/4)x = 22 (number of men who stayed)

x = 22 * (4/3)
x = 88/3

"Let's break down the problem step by step. We're dealing with a simple algebraic relationship between the costs of a magazine, a book, and a pen.

We know that the magazine costs half as much as the book. If the book costs $4, then the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we're told that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. To find the cost of the pen, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine: $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

"To determine the total number of boxes needed, we need to calculate the total number of pencils first. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. Since each box can hold 24 pencils, we can calculate the number of boxes Jam has as follows:

3 boxes * 24 pencils/box = 72 pencils

Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has a total of 72 + 2 = 74 pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we add Jam's pencils to Meg's pencils:

74 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 120 pencils

Now, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 24 to find the number of boxes needed:

120 pencils / 24 pencils/box = 5 boxes

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the total weakening of Shannon's iced coffee, we need to consider the cooling effect and the weakening caused by the added cream.

The coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, and each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Since the coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, it means 5 ice cubes were used (65 / 13 = 5). 

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.

The total weakening of the coffee is 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"Let's dive into the world of record trading. As a music enthusiast and a keen observer of human behavior, I've noticed that people tend to trade their old records for new ones in a 2:1 ratio. This means that for every 2 old records, they receive 1 new record.

In this scenario, 5 people come into the record store and leave with 7 new records. To find out how many old records they brought in, we can set up a simple equation:

Number of old records = Number of new records / 2

Since each person gets 1 new record, we can multiply the number of new records by the number of people to find the total number of new records:

Total new records = 7
Number of people = 5

Total new records = 7
Number of people = 5

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for the number of old records:

Number of old records = Total new records / 2
= 7 / 2
= 3.5

Since we can't trade a fraction of a record, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the number of old records must be a multiple of 2 (as per the 2:1 ratio). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Number of old records = 6

The 5 people brought in 6 old records."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to break down the problem into smaller components.

First, we know that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, which is 2/5 * 100 = 40.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the salary of a senior programmer is $2000 + $400 = $2400.

The number of senior programmers is the remaining employees, which is 100 - 40 = 60.

The total amount of money the company pays to junior programmers per month is 40 * $2000 = $80,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to senior programmers per month is 60 * $2400 = $144,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The final answer is: $224,000"
"To determine the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal, we can analyze the given information step by step.

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as x. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in, resulting in a total of (x + 5) - 7 + 8 people on the bus.

We are given that the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20. Since the number of people on the bus after the second stop is equal to the number of people heading to the third stop, we can set up the equation:

(x + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 8 = 20

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the total number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of lollipops Oscar has, we can break down the events:

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He then experiences a series of transactions that affect the number of lollipops he has.

First, he eats 2 lollipops on his way to school, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Next, he passes 14 lollipops to his friends, resulting in 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops. Now, he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

After that, he eats 3 lollipops that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

The final answer is 31."
"To calculate the time it takes to fully charge the phone, we need to determine the remaining percentage of charge and then convert it to minutes.

The phone is currently at 60% charged, so it needs 100% - 60% = 40% more charge. Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge 40% as follows:

40% / 1% = 40
40 * 3 minutes = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

120 minutes / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

"To determine the number of lollipops Erin has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more. This can be represented as:

7 (initial lollipops) + 10 (additional lollipops) = 17

Next, we subtract the 3 lollipops Erin gives to Ella:

17 - 3 = 14

Therefore, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Final answer: 14"
"To calculate the amount the customer paid, we need to consider the rewards they received and the discount applied.

The customer spent $80 and got $1 off for every $20 spent. Since they spent $80, they got 80 / 20 = 4 rewards.

However, the customer also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the actual rewards they got is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.

Now, subtract the rewards from the total amount they spent: 80 - 8 = 72.

The customer paid $72 on this shopping trip.

Final Answer: The final answer is $72."
"As a financial analyst specializing in tax planning and compensation, I'll break down the calculations to determine the net pay for each job.

Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Total hours worked: 2000 hours
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Total tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we compare the net pay amounts. Job B offers a net pay of $32,400, while Job A provides a net pay of $24,000. The difference in net pay is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

The final answer is: $8,400"
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can calculate 40% of the total number of castles and then divide that result by 2.

40% of 220 castles = 0.4 * 220 = 88

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we divide 88 by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final Answer: The final answer is 44."
"To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total amount paid in installments and add the advance payment for each offer.

Furniture United's offer:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes' offer:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

The cost difference between the two offers is $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100. However, since we are looking for the cost difference, we can express this as a positive value by taking the absolute difference: |$3,350 - $3,450| = $100.

The final answer is $100."
"To determine the number of guns each person would have if they were to share them equally, we need to calculate the total number of guns and divide it by 4.

The total number of guns is the sum of the guns each person has: 8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24.

Now, divide the total number of guns by 4:
24 ÷ 4 = 6

Therefore, each person would have 6 guns if they were to share them equally.

The final answer is: 6"
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can multiply the number of batches of suckers by the amount of sugar required per batch and add the amount of sugar needed for the batch of fudge.

The amount of sugar needed for suckers is 8 batches * 30 ounces per batch = 240 ounces.
The amount of sugar needed for fudge is 1 batch * 70 ounces per batch = 70 ounces.

Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"To calculate the final value of Maria's shares, we can use the concept of percentage change. 

First, we calculate the increase in the stock price: 
Increase = 50% of $8 = 0.5 * $8 = $4
Value after the first year = $8 + $4 = $12

Then, we calculate the decrease in the second year: 
Decrease = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
Value after the second year = $12 - $3 = $9

Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares is:
Total value = 8 shares * $9 per share = $72

The final value of Maria's shares is $72."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of hot dogs Luke ate as L, the number Thomas ate as T, and the number John ate as J.

We know that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so L = 2.

We also know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so T = 3L = 3(2) = 6.

Finally, John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so J = T/2 = 6/2 = 3.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the amount Luke ate from the amount John ate: J - L = 3 - 2 = 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic reasoning. Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as x. Since the other two groups are equal in number, each of them has 2x students. We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 200

Combine like terms:

5x = 200

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 40

This solution is consistent with the given conditions, as 40 is indeed 10 less than 50 (the number of students in the other two groups). Therefore, the smallest group has 40 students.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Let's dive into the world of animal husbandry and calculate the total number of legs on Farmer Brown's farm.

We know that Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as x. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens is 2x.

We can set up the equation: x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms: 3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3: x = 20

Now that we know there are 20 cows and 40 chickens, we can calculate the total number of legs:

Cows have 4 legs each, so 20 cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs.
Chickens have 2 legs each, so 40 chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the number of balls Josh has left to juggle, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. 

The number of balls after each week is as follows:
- Week 1: 3
- Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4
- Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5
- Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6

Since Josh drops 3 balls, but 2 are caught, he loses 1 ball. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 balls left.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, we need to add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and the container, and subtract the weight of the red bird.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds, and the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds. The container weighs 20 pounds, and the red bird weighs 30 pounds.

Total weight = (pink frog + blue beetle + green toad + yellow snake + container) - red bird
Total weight = (50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 20) - 30
Total weight = 190 - 30
Total weight = 160 pounds

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To determine the total number of baby outfits, we can simply add the number of outfits given by Laurel's friend, the new outfits received at the baby shower, and the outfits gifted by her mom.

Outfits from friend: 24

"As a sports analytics expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Tyson's training regimen.

To calculate the total distance covered in June, we need to first determine the new daily distance. Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters than his original 5000 meters. This can be calculated as:

New daily distance = Original daily distance + (Original daily distance * 1/5)
= 5000 + (5000 * 1/5)
= 5000 + 1000
= 6000 meters

Since June has 30 days, the total distance covered in June can be calculated as:

Total distance = New daily distance * Number of days
= 6000 * 30
= 180,000 meters

Therefore, Tyson will cover a total distance of 180,000 meters in June.

The final answer is: 180,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the prices of three juice boxes: Juice Box A, Juice Box B, and Juice Box C. We know that Juice Box A costs $4. Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, so its price can be calculated as $4 + $5 = $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, so its price is $4 + $7 = $11.

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C: $11 - $9 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total number of legs in the restaurant, we can use the formula:

Total legs = (number of tables with 4 legs * 4) + (number of tables with 3 legs * 3)

Given:
- Number of tables with 4 legs = 40
- Number of tables with 3 legs = 50

Total legs = (40 * 4) + (50 * 3)
Total legs = 160 + 150
Total legs = 310

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant is 310."
"To determine the number of cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days = 20 cookies

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies he eats is:
1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies

The total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband is:
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Since the bag has 36 cookies, the number of cookies left for Jenny to eat is:
36 cookies - 27 cookies = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To calculate the total cost of the shirts, we need to find the discount on one shirt and then multiply it by 2.

The discount on one shirt is 40% of $30, which can be calculated as:

Discount = 0.4 * $30 = $12

Now, subtract the discount from the original price of one shirt:

Price of one shirt after discount = $30 - $12 = $18

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, multiply the discounted price by 2:

Total cost of 2 shirts = $18 * 2 = $36

Therefore, the total cost of the 2 shirts is $36."
"To calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue, we need to find the difference in revenue and then divide it by the original revenue.

The factory used to sell 10 tractors a day at $100 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 10 * $100 = $1000. Now, they sell 5 silos a day at $220 each, resulting in a daily revenue of 5 * $220 = $1100.

The difference in daily revenue is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the original revenue and multiply by 100:

($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

Final Answer: The final answer is 10%."
"As a canine nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Madeline's dog expenses.

To calculate the total yearly cost of dog expenses, we need to consider the monthly costs of food, treats, and medicine. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the weekly cost of food and multiply it by 4.

The cost of food per week is $25, so the monthly cost of food is $25 * 4 = $100. Treats cost $20 per month, and medicine costs $100 per month.

To find the total monthly cost, we add the monthly costs of food, treats, and medicine: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost: $220 * 12 = $2640.

The final answer is: $2640"
"To calculate the total hours of Peyton's after-work activities, we need to consider the duration of each activity.

The cooking class on Tuesday is three times as long as the yoga class on Monday, which is 1 hour. Therefore, the cooking class is 3 * 1 = 3 hours long.

The museum tour on Thursday is half as long as the cooking class, which is 3 hours. So, the museum tour is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours long.

Now, let's add up the hours:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7.5 hours

The total hours of Peyton's after-work activities is 7.5 hours."
"To determine the number of plant pots April has left over, we need to calculate the total number of pots she needs. Since she requires twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, we can calculate the total number of pots needed as follows:

Number of pots for daisies = 30
Number of pots for roses = 2 * 30 = 60
Total number of pots needed = 30 + 60 = 90

Since April already had 100 plant pots, we subtract the total number of pots she needs from the number she already had:

100 - 90 = 10

April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To determine the amount Andrea saved, we can use a simple subtraction equation. 

Initial amount = $36
Amount spent on sweater = $11
Amount given to brother = $4

Total amount spent = $11 + $4 = $15

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"To determine the time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate 40% of his total vacation time. 

First, we calculate the total time John spent on activities other than sightseeing: 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (watching shows) = 15 hours.

Since 30% of his time was spent watching shows, we can set up an equation to find the total time: 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time. Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

Now, we can calculate 40% of the total time to find the time spent sightseeing: 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the amount Annabelle still needs to save, we need to determine her total earnings from both jobs and add it to her initial savings.

Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and worked for 20 hours, resulting in earnings of $200. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked for 15 hours, earning $75. 

Total earnings: $200 + $75 = $275

Now, let's add her initial savings: $80 + $275 = $355

To find out how much Annabelle still needs to save, we subtract her total earnings and initial savings from the cost of the phone: $400 - $355 = $45

The final answer is $45."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we can use the given information. Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as S, the height of the second tree as S + 5, and the height of the tallest tree as T.

We know that S = 6 feet. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is S + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

The combined height of the two shortest trees is S + (S + 5) = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two shortest trees, so T = 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money Dean has left, we need to consider the initial amount of money he had, the cost of the items he purchased, and the additional amount his mother gave him.

The initial amount of money Dean had was $28. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, which totals to 6 * $2 = $12. He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, totaling 5 * $1 = $5. The total cost of the items is $12 + $5 = $17.

To find the amount of money Dean has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money: $28 - $17 = $11.

However, his mother then gave him an extra $10. So, we add this amount to the remaining money: $11 + $10 = $21.

The final answer is $21."
"To determine the number of friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and subtract that from her budget.

The cost of a round of mini-golf is $5. Since she wants to play once, the total cost for mini-golf is $5.

The cost of the go-karts is $10 per ride. She wants to ride the go-karts twice, so the total cost for go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20.

The total cost of the activities is $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) = $25.

Now, let's subtract the total cost from her budget: $90 (budget) - $25 (total cost) = $65.

Since each friend will also get $5 in arcade tokens, we need to subtract that from the remaining budget as well: $65 - $5 = $60.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend (including the arcade tokens): $60 / $5 = 12.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 12 friends to her party."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Marisa receives $5 as her daily pocket money. She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each. To find out how much she saves, we need to calculate the total amount she spends on lollipops and subtract it from her daily pocket money.

Daily pocket money: $5
Number of lollipops bought per day: 4
Cost of each lollipop: $0.25
Total cost of lollipops per day: 4 * $0.25 = $1
Total cost of lollipops for 5 days: $1 * 5 = $5

Since Marisa saves the change, we need to subtract the total cost of lollipops from her daily pocket money:
$5 (daily pocket money) - $5 (total cost of lollipops) = $0

So, Marisa saves $0 in her piggy bank for 5 days.

Final answer: $0"
"To determine the number of pounds of candy Billy bought, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

First, we know that Billy spent $2 on gumballs. Since he took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, he must have had $2 left as change. This means he had $10 - $2 = $8 initially.

Now, we know that Billy spent $8 on gumballs, so he must have spent $10 - $8 = $2 on candy. Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount spent on candy ($2) by the cost per pound ($1.5) to find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.

Let's calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:

$2 ÷ $1.5 = 1.33 pounds

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pound of candy, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is not a whole number, so we will leave it as is.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.33}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable S, which represents the son's age.

Let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. We are given that Carver is 45 years old, so C = 45.

We are also given that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, which can be expressed as:

C = 2S - 5

Substituting C = 45 into the equation, we get:

45 = 2S - 5

Adding 5 to both sides of the equation, we get:

50 = 2S

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:

S = 25

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old.

25"
"To determine the number of days between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip and then divide it by the service interval.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city to the first city is 100 - 50 = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance).

The total distance traveled in one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 * 3 = 675 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance by the service interval:

675 miles / 18,000 miles = 0.0375 days

To convert days to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):

0.0375 days * 24 hours/day = 0.9 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 54 minutes

The train goes between services for approximately 54 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0.0375}$"
"To calculate the total amount of stuffing needed, we need to find the amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and add them together.

The Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. 

The average of 8 and 2 is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

To make 4 chihuahua beds, Mark needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

To make 3 collie beds, Mark needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

In total, Mark needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$"
"To calculate the total time taken for the trip, we need to break it down into three parts: the trip to his friend's house, the detour, and the return trip.

The distance to his friend's house is 200 miles, and the speed is 70 mph. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we can calculate the time taken for this part of the trip:

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

The detour added 10 miles to the trip, so the total distance for this part is 200 + 10 = 210 miles. The speed remains the same, 70 mph. Using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for the detour:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

The return trip is 240 miles, and the speed is 80 mph. Again, using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for the return trip:

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for each part of the trip to find the total time taken:

Total time = 2.86 hours + 3 hours + 3 hours = 8.86 hours

The final answer is: 8.86"
"To find the number of boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we need to subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students.

Total students = 96
Absent students = 5 girls + 4 boys = 9

Number of boys present = Total students - Absent students
= 96 - 9
= 87

There were 87 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

87"
"To determine the total number of kids in the park, we need to consider the given information. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can represent the number of boys as 2x and the number of girls as x. We know that the number of girls is 6, so we can set up the equation:

x = 6

To find the number of boys, we can multiply the number of girls by 2:

Number of boys = 2x
Number of boys = 2(6)
Number of boys = 12

Now, we can find the total number of kids by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of kids = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of kids = 12 + 6
Total number of kids = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Jane has already scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test, for a total of 33 points. To meet the requirement of at least 42 points, we can set up an inequality to represent the situation:

15 + 18 + x ≥ 42

where x is the number of points Jane needs on the third test.

Subtracting 33 from both sides of the inequality gives us:

x ≥ 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from the overall total.

Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as M, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as S, and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as V. We are given the following information:

M = 3
S = 4M - 5
V = 3S

We can substitute the value of S into the equation for V:
V = 3(4M - 5)
V = 12M - 15

Now, we can express the total number of customers kicked out as the sum of the customers kicked out for each reason:
Total = M + S + V
Total = M + (4M - 5) + (12M - 15)
Total = 17M - 20

We are given that the total number of customers kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation:
17M - 20 = 50

Solving for M:
17M = 50 + 20
17M = 70
M = 70 / 17
M = 4.12 (approximately)

Since M must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number, as you cannot have a fraction of a customer. However, in this case, we will keep the exact value of M for accuracy.

Now, we can find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons:
Total = 17M - 20
Total = 17(4.12) - 20
Total = 69.64 - 20
Total = 49.64

Since the total number of customers kicked out must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we will keep the exact value of the total for accuracy.

The number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 49.64. However, since the total number of customers kicked out must be a whole number, we can express this as:

49.64 ≈ 49

The closest whole number to 49.64 is 49.

Final answer: 49"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's say Sara had x points before. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, we can set up the equation:

Erin's points = 3 * Sara's points
14 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 14 / 3
x = 4.67

However, since we can't have a fraction of a point, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we are looking for how many points Erin had before, not Sara. Since Erin scored 14 points after scoring 14 points, it means Erin had 0 points before.

The correct answer is 0."
"To calculate the total cost of senior gifts, we need to consider the costs associated with picture frames, pins, and cords.

First, let's calculate the cost of picture frames. Each frame costs $20, and an additional 20% of this cost is required for etching the logo. This can be calculated as:

$20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24 per frame

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames is:

44 * $24 = $1056

Next, we need to calculate the cost of pins. Two seniors will receive pins, each costing $5. The total cost for pins is:

2 * $5 = $10

Now, let's calculate the cost of cords for the officers. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, which is 44 / 4 = 11 seniors. Each cord costs $12. The total cost for cords is:

11 * $12 = $132

To find the total cost of senior gifts, we add the costs of picture frames, pins, and cords:

$1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"When it comes to calculating the cost of a DIY hand-painted wallpaper, it's essential to consider the original cost and the discount. In this case, the original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. To find the cost after the 20% discount, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Original Cost - (Original Cost * Discount Percentage)

In this scenario, the discount percentage is 20%, which can be represented as 0.20 in decimal form. Plugging in the values, we get:

Total Cost = $400 - ($400 * 0.20)
Total Cost = $400 - $80
Total Cost = $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320.

The final answer is: $320"
"To calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold, we need to consider the sales data for each day of the sale.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is 2 * 14 = 28 pairs.

On Sunday, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

However, 6 people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract those from the total.

Total number of shoes sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) - 6 (returned) = 50

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the total hours of dance practice per week, we need to calculate the hours for each day and add them together.

Hallie's dance practice schedule is as follows:

- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours (twice as long as Tuesday's night class)

Total hours per week = Tuesday hours + Thursday hours + Saturday hours

Therefore, Hallie has 5 hours of dance practice per week.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to first find the number of faulty pieces and then subtract that from the total number of pieces.

Let's assume the total number of pieces is x. Since 40% of the equipment were faulty, the number of faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The number of functioning pieces is x - 0.4x = 0.6x.

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is the total amount spent on all pieces minus the amount spent on faulty pieces. Since the total amount spent on all pieces is $400,000, the amount spent on faulty pieces is 0.4x.

The amount spent on functioning pieces can be represented as:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = Total amount spent on all pieces - Amount spent on faulty pieces
= $400,000 - 0.4x

Since we know that 0.6x represents the number of functioning pieces, we can set up the equation:

0.6x = 0.6 * 400,000

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

x = 0.6 * 400,000 / 0.6
x = 400,000

Now that we know the total number of pieces is 400,000, we can find the number of functioning pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = 0.6x
= 0.6 * 400,000
= 240,000

The total amount spent on functioning pieces is:

Amount spent on functioning pieces = $400,000 - 0.4x
= $400,000 - 0.4 * 400,000
= $400,000 - $160,000
= $240,000

The final answer is: $240,000"
"To calculate the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we need to consider the milk production from both halves of her sheep.

Since Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of the sheep and 2 kg of milk from the other half, we can calculate the total milk production as follows:

Total milk production = (1 kg * 15 sheep) + (2 kg * 15 sheep)
Total milk production = 15 kg + 30 kg
Total milk production = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"To determine the total number of apples picked by Lucy over the three days, we can analyze the given information.

We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and received $56. Since the price per apple is $4, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Monday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Monday = Total amount received / Price per apple
= $56 / $4
= 14 apples

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. Since she picked double the number of apples on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as follows:

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * Number of apples picked on Tuesday
= 2 * 12
= 24 apples

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

Total number of apples picked = Number of apples picked on Monday + Number of apples picked on Tuesday + Number of apples picked on Wednesday
= 14 + 12 + 24
= 50 apples

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of socks Lindsay has missed, we need to calculate the total number of socks she has washed and subtract that from the total number of socks.

Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is equivalent to 10 * 2 = 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks.

Since there are 50 socks in total, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cookies left for Rachel, we need to consider the sequence of events.

"To calculate Karan's monthly payment, we can use the formula for monthly payments on a loan:

M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal amount = $3,650
r = monthly interest rate = 10%/12 = 0.008333
n = number of payments = 5 months

M = 3650[0.008333(1 + 0.008333)^5]/[(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1]
M ≈ 802.35

The final answer is: $802.35"
"To determine the distance each person hiked, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

For Cho, the distance hiked is:
Distance = 14 km/h x 8 h
Distance = 112 km

For Chloe, the distance hiked is:
Distance = 9 km/h x 5 h

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to calculate the amount of silver and gold they have.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 + 100 = 150.
The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 + 120 = 200.

The total number of pesos they have together is 150 + 200 = 350.

Final answer: 350"
"To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to first determine the total number of cups of lemonade she can make. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she buys enough supplies for 3 pitchers, the total number of cups is 3 * 12 = 36 cups.

Her revenue is the total number of cups sold multiplied by the price per cup, which is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

The cost is the initial investment, which is $18.

Her profit is the revenue minus the cost, so $36 - $18 = $18.

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours she needs to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the number of hours is 36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

The final answer is: $2"
"To find the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had, we can set up an equation. Let's say the original amount of land is x hectares.

Since he sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 left. We know that 2/5 of x is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 5/2:

x = 12.8 * (5/2)
x = 32

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is: 32"
"To determine the number of people performing, we need to calculate the total number of girls in the choir, which is 50% of 52. This can be calculated as 0.5 * 52 = 26.

Since half the people performing can't make it to the show, we need to find half of the total number of people performing. The total number of people performing is the number of girls (26) plus the 3 teachers, which is 26 + 3 = 29. Half of 29 is 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we can't have half a person, we'll round down to 14.

However, we must also consider the 3 teachers who will be performing. Therefore, the total number of people performing is 26 (girls) + 3 (teachers) - 14 (half of the performers) = 15.

The final answer is 15."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. Let's represent the number of popsicles Betty has as 5x and the number of popsicles Sam has as 6x.

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:
x = 15

Now that we know x, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
Betty: 5x = 5(15) = 75
Sam: 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the difference, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
90 - 75 = 15

The final answer is 15."
"To calculate the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to consider the costs of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

The cost of Netflix is $10 per month. 

The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 per month each, but Tim gets a 20% discount for bundling. 20% of $10 is $2, so the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 - $2 = $8 per month.

The total cost of the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $18 per month.

The cost of the cable package is $60 per month.

To find out how much Tim saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $18 (streaming services) = $42

Therefore, Tim saves $42 per month by cancelling his cable package.

"To calculate the total number of bugs, we need to break down the information provided.

First, we know that Nancy saw 90 spiders. Since the number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90
= 30

Next, we are told that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = 2 * 30 - 12
= 60 - 12
= 48

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

Total number of bugs = 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 48 (stink bugs)
= 90 + 30 + 48

"As an energy efficiency expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage of the air conditioner.

To determine the energy saved, we need to calculate the difference in energy consumption between the original 8 hours of usage and the reduced 3 hours of usage per day.

First, let's calculate the energy used in 8 hours a day:
Energy used in 8 hours a day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours (Wh)

Next, we'll calculate the energy used in 3 hours a day:
Energy used in 3 hours a day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 Wh

Now, we'll find the energy saved per day by subtracting the energy used in 3 hours from the energy used in 8 hours:
Energy saved per day = 7200 Wh - 2700 Wh = 4500 Wh

To convert the energy saved per day to kilowatts, we'll divide by 1000:
Energy saved per day = 4500 Wh / 1000 = 4.5 kWh

Finally, we'll calculate the energy saved in 30 days:

"To determine the total cost of the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.

Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and each sandwich serves 4 people, we need:

- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- 5 pounds of meat * $7.00 per pound = $35.00
- 5 pounds of cheese * $3.00 per pound = $15.00

"To determine the combined total of corns and cannolis, we need to first find the number of corns. Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and Allan has 40 cannolis, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of corns and cannolis.

Let's denote the number of corns as C. We know that C = 2 * 40 (since there are twice as many corns as cannolis). However, this is incorrect as it would imply that Allan initially had 80 corns. 

We are told that Allan bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, we can set up the equation: C = 2 * (40 + 60) - 40.

Simplifying the equation, we get C = 2 * 100 - 40 = 160.

Now, we can find the combined total of corns and cannolis by adding the number of corns and cannolis: 160 + 100 = 260.

The final answer is: $\boxed{260}$"
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to consider the steps completed before the jog and the remaining steps.

Elliott completed 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school and 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. This totals 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Since Elliott aimed to take 10,000 steps in total and had 2,000 steps left after the jog, we can calculate the steps taken during the jog by subtracting the remaining steps from the total steps completed before the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to consider the number of employees and their hourly wage.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. This results in a total of:
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $24,000

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees left. 
1/4 of 40 is 10 employees. 
So, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees in June.

The total amount paid in June is:
30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours = $18,000

The total amount paid in the two months is:
$24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is 2 x $400 = $800. The total cost of the two packages is $400 + $800 = $1200.

A 20% discount is applied to the total cost of the two packages, which is 0.20 x $1200 = $240. The cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

Adding the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is: $1110"
"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, we can use the following calculation:

Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies needed by 12 to find the number of dozens:

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

Therefore, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

Final answer: 5"
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to calculate the intersection of the two sets: candles with the defect (5%) and candles that are more dangerous.

First, let's find the number of candles with the defect:
0.05 x 50,000 = 2,500 candles

Since these candles are also more dangerous and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can assume that all 2,500 candles with the defect will explode.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 2,500.

Final answer: $\boxed{2500}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to find the discount amount for each blouse and then multiply it by the number of blouses.

The discount is 30% of the regular price of $20. 
Discount = 0.3 * $20 = $6

The discounted price of each blouse is the regular price minus the discount amount.
Discounted price = $20 - $6 = $14

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
Total cost = 4 * $14 = $56

The final answer is: $56"
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees as x, the number of apples from the shortest trees as y, and the number of apples from the average trees as z.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, so x = 30. We also know that her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.

Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, she gathers y = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so her sister gathers 3y = 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is x + 2x + y + 3y = 3x + 4y. We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 4y + z = 500

We also know that the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 4y. Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 4y). However, we can simplify this by using the fact that z = 500 - (3x + 4y).

Now we can rewrite the equation as 3x + 4y + 500 - (3x + 4y) = 500.

Simplifying the equation, we get 500 = 500.

This equation is true for any value of x and y, which means that the number of apples gathered from the average trees is not directly related to x and y. However, we can find the value of z by using the fact that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.

Since the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 3x + 4y, and the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (3x + 4y). However, we can simplify this by using the fact that z = 500 - (3x + 4y).

To find the value of z, we can use the fact that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 apples from the shortest trees, so the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 + 15 = 45. Her sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, so the total number of apples gathered by her sister is 60 + 45 = 105.

Since the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500, the number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (45 + 105) = 500 - 150 = 350.

The final answer is 350."
"Let's dive into the world of camel and dromedary populations. As a camel expert, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that the total number of heads is 180 and the total number of bumps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can set up the following equations:

Let c be the number of camels and d be the number of dromedaries.

We know that the total number of heads is the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries, so we can write the equation:

c + d = 180

We also know that the total number of bumps is the sum of twice the number of camels (since each camel has two humps) and the number of dromedaries (since each dromedary has one hump). This gives us the equation:

2c + d = 304

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
c = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting c into one of the original equations:

c + d = 180
124 + d = 180
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break it down into parts.

In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is:
200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 30% of 800 km is:
0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

So, the total distance traveled in the first 6 days is:
800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

On the next day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so we don't need to add any distance to this.

During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in a week, so the total distance traveled in the second week is:
300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

Now, we add the distances traveled in the first 6 days and the second week:
1040 km + 2100 km = 3140 km

The total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is 3140 kilometers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3140}$"
" locker sizes are a fascinating topic in the realm of spatial geometry. As someone who appreciates the beauty of blue, I find the relationships between locker sizes to be particularly intriguing.

To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we can start by analyzing the given information. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. We can use this information to find Zack's locker size.

Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can set up the following equation:

Zack's locker size = 4 * Peter's locker size
Zack's locker size = 4 * 5 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 20 cubic inches

Now that we know Zack's locker size, we can find Timothy's locker size by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2, as Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker.

Timothy's locker size = 2 * Zack's locker size
Timothy's locker size = 2 * 20 cubic inches
Timothy's locker size = 40 cubic inches

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To determine the distance Oliver must climb, we need to find the difference in elevation between Stanley's comb and Oliver's current elevation.

The elevation of Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. 

10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"As a financial analyst, I can help you calculate the total capital Mr. Josue has now.

To find the total amount of capital, we need to add the initial amount he had to the amount he received from the two banks. 

Initial capital: $5000
Amount received from the first bank: $4000
Amount received from the second bank: 2 * $4000 = $8000

Total amount received: $4000 + $8000 = $12000

Now, let's add the initial capital to the total amount received:
$5000 + $12000 = $17000

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps:

First, 4 boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.

The remaining cats on the rock are 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18.

So, 18 cats ran after the mouse, leaving 30 - 18 = 12 cats on the rock.

The final answer is 12."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into three parts:

The first 6 months at $8 per month is equivalent to 6 * $8 = $48. The next 8 months at $12 per month is equivalent to 8 * $12 = $96. The last 8 months at $14 per month is equivalent to 8 * $14 = $112.

Now, let's add up the costs: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

The total cost of 2 years of the service is $256."
"Let's dive into the world of jeans pricing and savings. As someone who appreciates the beauty of a well-crafted pair of jeans, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that the tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as x. Then, the original price of the tattered jeans is x + 6.

Since Cole saved a total of $6 and 1/3 of it came from the jogger jeans, 2/3 of the total savings came from the tattered jeans. We can set up the equation:

1/3x + 2/3(x + 6) = 6

To simplify, we'll first find a common denominator for the fractions:

1/3x + 2/3x + 4 = 6

Combine like terms:

3/3x + 4 = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3/3x = 2

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

x = 2

Now that we know the original price of the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:

Original price of tattered jeans = x + 6
= 2 + 6
= 8

The difference in price between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is:

$8 - $2
= $6

The final answer is: $6"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each vehicle and add them together.

The capacity of the buses is 4 x 60 = 240 employees.
The capacity of the minibusses is 6 x 30 = 180 employees.
The capacity of the minivans is 10 x 15 = 150 employees.

Now, let's add the capacities of all vehicles together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

The total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder and then add them together.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and Lillian buys 3 of them. So, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each. She builds 3 of these feeders, so the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90.

Now, we add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders: 60 + 90 = 150.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

Final answer: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the cost of each item and add them together.

The bagel costs $4. Since the soup costs 25% more than the bagel, we can calculate its cost as follows:

Cost of soup = Cost of bagel + (25% of Cost of bagel)
= $4 + (0.25 * $4)
= $4 + $1
= $5

The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, so the cake costs:

Cost of cake = Cost of bagel / 2
= $4 / 2
= $2

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

Total cost = Cost of bagel + Cost of soup + Cost of cake
= $4 + $5 + $2
= $11

Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner."
"To determine the initial number of cards Kenny had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the total number of cards as x. Since Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells 2/3 of them. The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is $50, and each card is sold for $1.5.

The equation to represent the situation is:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50

To solve for x, we can start by multiplying the fractions and the dollar amount:

(2/3)x * $1.5 = $50
(2/3)x * 1.5 = $50
(2 * 1.5) / 3 * x = $50
2.5x / 3 = $50

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to isolate x:

2.5x = $150

Finally, divide both sides by 2.5:

x = $150 / 2.5
x = 60

Therefore, Kenny started with 60 cards.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we can use the concept of total demand and supply. The caterer initially prepared for 18 guests to have two hotdogs, which accounts for 36 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.

Let's calculate the total number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests to have two hotdogs:

40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs

Since the caterer only had 36 hotdogs, there was a shortage of 80 - 36 = 44 hotdogs.

To find the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog, we subtract the number of guests who received two hotdogs from the total number of guests:

40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests

Therefore, 22 guests did not receive a second hotdog.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we need to calculate the number of letters in each name separately and then add them together.

Indras' name has 6 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and 4 more than that is 7. So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). 

6 + 7 = 13

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"As a seasoned math expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order.

To find the total cost of the items, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00
   Total cost: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. Calculate the 20% discount:
   20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and subtract the amount she has.

The total cost of the items is $6 (skipping rope) + $11 (board game) + $2 (playground ball) = $19.

Dora has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother, so she has a total of $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the amount she has from the total cost:
$19 (total cost) - $18 (amount she has) = $1

Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball.

The final answer is: $1"
"To determine the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew, we can analyze the information step by step.

First, we know that Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. Then, Prince Arthur, using a spear, slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. This can be expressed as 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

Next, we are told that Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. This means Prince Walter slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce, having forgotten his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file. This translates to 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the amount of gasoline Josey needed, we can divide the total amount of gas (15 gallons) by the number of containers (5) and then multiply the result by the fraction of the container she used (1/4).

First, we'll divide 15 gallons by 5 containers: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons per container.

Next, we'll multiply the amount per container by the fraction of the container used: 3 gallons * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.

Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we'll convert 3/4 gallon to pints: 3/4 * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$"
"To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how much money George spent on chips and candy bars combined. Since he spent $5, which is equivalent to 500 cents, and had 1% of his money left, he spent 99% of his money, which is 500 - (500 x 1%) = 500 - 5 = 495 cents.

We know that George bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, the total cost of chips is 3 x 40 = 120 cents. To find out how much he spent on candy bars, we subtract the cost of chips from the total amount he spent: 495 - 120 = 375 cents.

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can divide the amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar to find out how many he bought: 375 / 75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends.

Total lollipops = 25
Lollipops kept by Ray = 5
Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20

Since the remaining lollipops were shared equally among 4 friends, we divide the remaining lollipops by 4.

Lollipops per friend = 20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

The final answer is 5."

"To calculate the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to determine the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.

The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00. Since Antoine is doubling the amount of onions, he needs 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.

Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

The cost per serving is $2.00."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to calculate the time difference between their travel times.

Let's denote the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater as W and the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater as B. We know that B = 4W (since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel).

We also know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we can set up the equation: B = W - 5.

Substituting B = 4W into the equation, we get: 4W = W - 5.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3W = 5.

Dividing both sides by 3, we get: W = 5/3.

Now that we know the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, we can find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater: B = 4W = 4(5/3) = 20/3.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to subtract the time it takes for her to get to the theater from the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater: 5 - (20/3) = 5 - 20/3 = (15 - 20)/3 = -5/3.

Since we can't have a negative time, we can convert this to a more meaningful answer. To do this, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and then round it to the nearest whole number. 

Converting -5/3 to a decimal, we get -1.67. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get -2.

However, since we can't have a negative number of minutes, we can re-evaluate the problem. We know that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and it takes her 20/3 minutes to get to the theater. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 20/3 + 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Converting 20/3 to a decimal, we get 6.67. Adding 5 to this, we get 11.67. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we can round this to the nearest whole number. Rounding 11.67 to the nearest whole number, we get 12.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Final answer: 12"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard = 3 feet, the length of the room is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length * Width. We know the area is 360 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

360 = 9 * Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 9:

Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98 feet

The perimeter of the room is 98 feet."
"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to calculate the total number of beads each one bought.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40). So, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80). So, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads between the two sisters is 140 - 60 = 80.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To determine the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to consider the temperature changes due to baking and cooling.

The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. When Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the temperature increase is:

Temperature change = 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

After baking, the temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.

However, when Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. This means the cooling rate is 0.2 degrees/minute. To find the total cooling effect, we need to calculate the cooling effect for 30 minutes:

Cooling time = 30 minutes
Cooling rate = 0.2 degrees/minute
Temperature change due to cooling = 0.2 degrees/minute * 30 minutes = 6 degrees

Now, let's calculate the final temperature:

Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature after baking = 40 + 15 = 55 degrees
Temperature after cooling = 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

The final temperature of the house is 49 degrees.

The final answer is 49."
"To determine James' time for the run, we need to analyze the given information. 

First, we calculate James' time for the swim by finding 10% of Jon's swim time and subtracting it from Jon's swim time. 

10% of 40 minutes is 0.1 * 40 = 4 minutes. 
Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.

Next, we calculate James' bike time by adding 5 minutes to Jon's bike time. Jon's bike time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes. 
James' bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, we can set up an equation to find James' run time. Let's denote James' run time as x. The total time for Jon is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes, and the total time for James is 36 + 85 + x. The difference between their times is 10 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

170 - (36 + 85 + x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:
170 - 121 - x = 10
49 - x = 10
-x = -39
x = 39

Therefore, James' run time is 39 minutes.

The final answer is 39."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to break down the information provided. 

First, we know that Movie C was 1.25 hours long. We convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B.

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find the length of Movie A, we divide the length of Movie B by 4.

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the hay, we need to first determine the total amount of hay consumed. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, and it ran 16 miles, the total amount of hay consumed is:

Hay consumption = 16 miles * 1/2 bail per mile
Hay consumption = 8 bails

The cost of the hay is:
Cost = Hay consumption * Cost per bail
Cost = 8 bails * $3 per bail
Cost = $24

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to consider the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

The salesman initially bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them at a flash sale on Monday for $20 each, generating $340 in revenue. The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each throughout the rest of the week. 

First, let's calculate the revenue from the remaining sneakers: 
Number of sneakers left = 48 - 17 = 31
Revenue from selling 31 sneakers at $25 = 31 * $25 = $775

Now, we can calculate the total revenue: 
Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1115

The profit is then calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: 
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $1115 - $576
Profit = $539

The final answer is: $539"

Total colors from six packets = 6 x 8 = 48
Total colors from four packets = 4 x 16 = 64

Now, we add the total number of colors from both types of packets: 48 + 64 = 112

Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all.

Final Answer: The final answer is 112."
"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the given information. We know that the cost of the super ticket is $20, and by not buying it, you saved $2. This means the cost of the movie ticket and popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $2 = $18.

The cost of the super ticket includes one popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the movie ticket without the super ticket is $18 - $1 = $17.

Since the cost of the movie ticket is $12, the cost of the popcorn can be found by subtracting the cost of the movie ticket from the cost without the super ticket: $17 - $12 = $5.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $5.

The final answer is: $5"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that there are 15 red cards. To find the number of green cards, we need to calculate 60% of 15 (the number of red cards) and add it to 15.

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
= 15 + (0.6 * 15)
= 15 + 9
= 24

Now, we know the number of red cards (15) and green cards (24). We are also told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
= 39

To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards.

Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
= 78

"To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots.

The total number of puppies is the sum of the puppies from Jennifer's dog and Brandon's dog: 8 + 12 = 20.

The number of puppies with spots is the sum of the puppies with spots from Jennifer's dog and Brandon's dog: 3 + 4 = 7.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100.

(7 / 20) * 100 = 35%

Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is 35%.

The final answer is: 35%"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed and divide it by the capacity of the truck.

The total weight of the feed is the sum of the weights of each item: 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4400 pounds.

Now, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck: 4400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip.

To find the number of trips, we perform the division: 4400 ÷ 2250 = 1.96.

Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"As a recycling expert, I can help you calculate Grayson's earnings from recycling cans and bottles.

To determine Grayson's weekly earnings, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately. 

Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and she drinks 3 cans a week. So, her earnings from aluminum cans per week is 3 * 2 = 6 cents.

She earns 3 cents for each plastic bottle and she drinks 5 bottles a week. So, her earnings from plastic bottles per week is 5 * 3 = 15 cents.

"To determine the number of pencils left, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the total number of pencils initially. Since there are 30 students and each student starts with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is 30 * 10 = 300.

Next, we calculate the number of pencils used in 2 months. Since 1/5 of the total pencils were used, we can find this by multiplying 300 by 1/5, which is equal to 300 * (1/5) = 60.

Now, we subtract the number of pencils used from the total to find the remaining pencils: 300 - 60 = 240.

Finally, we calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year. Since 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, we multiply 240 by 1/3, which is equal to 240 * (1/3) = 80.

The number of pencils left is 80."

"When calculating the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to consider the total length of the remoras. Since there are 2 remoras, each measuring 6 inches, we first convert the length of the remoras to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is equivalent to 0.5 feet.

The combined length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we divide the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) by the length of the shark (10 feet) and multiply by 100.

(1 / 10) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, the remoras occupy 10% of the shark's body length.

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. Let's say the total number of students is x. Since three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, the number of students with a desktop computer is (3/4)x.

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, so the number of students without a desktop computer is x - (3/4)x = (1/4)x.

We can set up the equation (1/4)x = 20 and solve for x. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 4:

(1/4)x * 4 = 20 * 4
x = 80

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to break down the expenses into two main components: the plane tickets and the hotel.

The cost of the plane tickets is $5000 each, and since there are two people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. To find the cost of the hotel, we need to calculate 20% of $1500, which is 0.2 x $1500 = $300. Then, we add this to the normal price: $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are there for 3 days, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The final answer is: $15,400"

"The problem at hand involves determining the combined weight of two pennies, one from 1959 and the other from 2010. To solve this, we need to understand the weight relationship between the two coins.

Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can express this relationship as a ratio. Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as x. Then, the weight of the 2010 penny is 3/4x.

We are also given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. So, we can set up the equation:

x = 48

Now, we can find the weight of the 2010 penny:

Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4x
= 3/4 * 48
= 36 grains

To find the combined weight, we add the weights of both pennies:

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
= 48 + 36
= 84 grains

"To determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player, we need to calculate the difference in their song capacities. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we can express this as a ratio.

Let's denote Gabriel's songs as G and Luri's songs as L. We know that L = 3G. We also know that Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs, so G ≤ 100. 

We can set up an equation to represent the situation: L = 3G. Since Luri's player can also store up to 100 songs, we can set up the inequality 3G ≤ 100.

To find the maximum number of songs Luri can add, we need to find the maximum value of G that satisfies the inequality 3G ≤ 100. 

Dividing both sides of the inequality by 3, we get G ≤ 100/3. 

G ≤ 33.33

Since G must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a song), the maximum value of G is 33.

Now, we can find the maximum number of songs Luri can add by subtracting G from 100:

Luri's maximum capacity = 100 - 33 = 67

The difference in the number of songs they can add is 67 - 33 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"To calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to find 2/5 of the total number of oranges picked and then multiply it by the amount he gave up for each orange.

Since 2/5 of 60 oranges is equivalent to (2/5) * 60, we can simplify this expression by first multiplying the numerator (2) by 60, then dividing the result by the denominator (5).

(2 * 60) / 5 = 120 / 5 = 24

Now, we multiply the result by the amount he gave up for each orange, which is $10.

24 * $10 = $240

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's represent the cost of her shoes as 's' and the cost of her handbag as 'h'. We are given that her shoes cost $80, so s = $80.

We are also given that her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. This can be represented as h = 3s - 20.

Substituting s = $80 into the equation, we get h = 3($80) - 20.

First, calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes: 3($80) = $240.

Then, subtract $20 from the result: $240 - $20 = $220.

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220.

Final answer: $220"

Given that the child already has $4 and the toy costs $12, the remaining amount is:

Remaining amount = $12 - $4
Remaining amount = $8

Now, we can divide the remaining amount by the daily savings amount of $2:

Number of days = $8 / $2
Number of days = 4

Therefore, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount and buy the toy.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to consider the capacity of the trays and the total number of eggs.

Each tray can hold 24 eggs, and Jaime has 2 trays. The total capacity of the trays is 2 * 24 = 48 eggs.

Since Jaime has 64 eggs, we can subtract the total capacity from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs that won't be placed: 64 - 48 = 16.

Therefore, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the tray.

Final answer: 16"
"To calculate the total cost of the pizzas, we need to multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3 to find the cost of the family-size pizza.

The final answer is: $32"
"To calculate the cost of each individual razor, we need to consider the sale and coupon.

Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, she will only pay for 1 pack of razors. 

The cost of 1 pack of razors is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the total cost will be $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor will be $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 * 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To calculate the total height of the human pyramid, we need to consider the heights of each layer. Since 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall, we can assume the average height of the bottom layer is 64"" (as the 10th girl is 60"" tall, which is the shortest).

The bottom layer has 4 girls, so the total height of this layer is 4 * 64"" = 256"".

The next layer has 3 girls standing on top of the 4, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 3 * 64"" = 192"".

The next layer has 2 girls standing on top of the 3, and the average height of these girls is also 64"" (since 9 out of 10 are 64"" tall). So, the total height of this layer is 2 * 64"" = 128"".

The shortest girl is 60"" tall, and she is at the top of the pyramid.

Now, let's add up the heights of all the layers: 
256"" + 192"" + 128"" + 60"" = 576""

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
576"" / 12 = 48 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{48}$"
"To calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walked in 5 days, we can multiply the number of minutes she walks per day by the number of days.

Charisma walks 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours a day. So, the total minutes she walks per day is 8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day.

To find the total minutes she walked in 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by 5: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To find Angela's current age, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote Angela's current age as A. In four years, Angela will be A + 4 years old, and Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. According to the problem, Angela's age in four years will be three times her current age. This can be expressed as:

A + 4 = 3A

Now, we can solve for A by subtracting A from both sides of the equation:

4 = 2A

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

A = 2

So, Angela is currently 2 years old.

The final answer is: 2"
"To calculate the total cost of Paul's daily driving expenses, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Morning Rides * Cost per Morning Ride) + (Number of Afternoon Rides * Cost per Afternoon Ride)

Given:
- Number of Morning Rides = 2 rides per day
- Number of Afternoon Rides = 2 rides per day
- Cost per Morning Ride = $6
- Cost per Afternoon Ride = $2

Total Cost = (2 * $6) + (2 * $2)
Total Cost = $12 + $4
Total Cost = $16 per day

Since Paul drives twice a day for 14 days, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days:

Total Cost = $16 per day * 14 days
Total Cost = $224

The final answer is: $224"
"To determine the total number of greek orange pies Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they have. 

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so Ashley brought 5 x 10 = 50 oranges. 

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.

In total, they brought 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.

Since one greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the total number of pies they can make is 120 / 3 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of greek orange pies they can make is 40.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the point at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to consider the total cost of each venue. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, plus an additional $5 per guest for food. The second venue charges $25 per guest, with food included.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides:

200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

10 = x

This means that 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

The final answer is: 10"
"To solve this insect collection problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of insects each person found.

Let's denote the number of insects Bodhi found as x. Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David found x/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

2x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2x = 36

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find the number of insects Lily found:

Lily found x/2 + 7 = 18/2 + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects.

The final answer is: 16"

"To determine the length of the couch, we can use the given information. The chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, making it 8 feet wide. 

Since the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, we can calculate its length as follows:

Length of couch = 2 * width of rug + 2
= 2 * 8 + 2
= 16 + 2
= 18 feet

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we can start by finding the total amount spent on the grape and green apple gum. Since Suzie paid $2 for a pack of grape gum and half as much for a pack of green apple gum, the cost of the green apple gum is $2 / 2 = $1.

The total amount spent on grape and green apple gum is $2 + $1 = $3. 

Since Suzie spent a total of $7, the amount spent on strawberry gum is $7 - $3 = $4.

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we divide the total amount spent on strawberry gum by the number of packs purchased. Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the cost of each pack is $4 / 2 = $2.

"As a transportation expert, I can help you calculate the cost savings of buying a weekly bus pass.

To determine the total weekly cost of bus trips, we need to multiply the number of bus trips per week by the cost per trip. Janet takes two bus trips per day, 5 days a week, so the total number of bus trips per week is 2 x 5 = 10.

The cost of each bus trip is $2.20. Therefore, the total cost of 10 bus trips is 10 x $2.20 = $22.

If Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $22 - $20 = $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does. This means the zoo has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does. So, the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

To find the total number of animals in the farm and zoo, we can add the number of cows and sheep from both places. 

Total animals = 30 (cows from the farm) + 60 (cows from the zoo) + 10 (sheep from the farm) + 20 (sheep from the zoo) = 120.

Therefore, the total number of animals in the farm and zoo is 120."

"I'm delighted to help you with your question. As a nutrition expert, I'll provide you with a well-researched and accurate answer.

To calculate the daily calorie deficit needed for Andy to lose 30 pounds in 7 months, we need to determine the total number of days he has to achieve his goal. Since his birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st, we can calculate the number of days as follows:

December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st, there are 0 days.
January has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st, there are 31 days.
February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), so from January 1st to February 28th, there are 31 days.
March has 31 days, so from January 1st to March 31st, there are 62 days.
April has 30 days, so from January 1st to April 30th, there are 93 days.
May has 31 days, so from January 1st to May 31st, there are 124 days.
June has 30 days, so from January 1st to June 30th, there are 154 days.
July has 31 days, so from January 1st to July 31st, there are 185 days.
August has 31 days, so from January 1st to August 31st, there are 216 days.
September has 30 days, so from January 1st to September 30th, there are 246 days.
October has 31 days, so from January 1st to October 31st, there are 277 days.
November has 30 days, so from January 1st to November 30th, there are 307 days.
December has 31 days, so from January 1st to December 31st, there are 338 days.

In total, Andy has 338 days to lose 30 pounds.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we can calculate the total number of calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds:

30 pounds x 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

To find the daily calorie deficit, we can divide the total number of calories by the number of days:

105,000 calories ÷ 338 days ≈ 310 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 310 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds in 7 months.

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"

"To determine the cost of the house, we can use the concept of ratios. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the equation:

House cost = 3 * Lot cost

Let's represent the cost of the lot as x. Then, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost is the sum of the house and lot costs, which is x + 3x = 4x. We are given that the total cost is $120,000. So, we can set up the equation:

4x = 120,000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 120,000 / 4
x = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot (x), we can find the cost of the house by multiplying x by 3:

House cost = 3x
House cost = 3 * 30,000
House cost = 90,000

The house cost $90,000.

"To determine the number of cookies Kelsie made, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of cookies Suzanne made as S, Josh's cookies as J, and Kelsie's cookies as K.

We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so we can express this as:

J = S/4

We also know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we can express this as:

K = 2J

Given that Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can substitute S = 36 into the first equation:

J = 36/4
J = 9

Now that we have Josh's cookies, we can find Kelsie's cookies by substituting J into the second equation:

K = 2J
K = 2(9)
K = 18

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

"To determine the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house, we can use the concept of inverse proportionality between the number of people and the time required to complete the task.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can calculate the time it takes for one person to paint a whole house as 10 days. 

Now, we can use the formula: Time = (Total Work) / (Number of Workers)

In this case, the total work is 1 whole house, and the number of workers is 5. 

Time = 1 / 5 = 0.2 days

To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24 (the number of hours in a day):

Time = 0.2 days * 24 hours/day = 4.8 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people approximately 4.8 hours to paint a whole house.

Final answer: $\boxed{4.8}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and each has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. This means Ophelia has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna: 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 108.

The final answer is: $\boxed{108}$"
"To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphone set, we need to calculate the difference in cost between the total amount paid and the cost of the headphone set.

Let's denote the cost of one CD as C and the cost of the headphone set as H. We know that the total amount paid is $48, and the cost of the CD is $4. We can set up the equation:

C + H = 48
C = 4

To find the cost of the headphone set, we can subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

H = 48 - 4
H = 44

Now, we can divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought:

Number of additional CDs = H / C
= 44 / 4
= 11

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs if he hadn't purchased the headphone set.

The final answer is 11."

"To determine the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving 48 - 8 = 40 passengers. Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get on the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40. So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 + 40 = 80.

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving 80 - 21 = 59 passengers. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus, which is 3 times the number who got off (21), so 3 * 21 = 63. So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 + 63 = 122.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote James' current age as 'J' and his cousin's current age as 'C'. 

We know that James will turn 27 in 5 years, so we can write an equation for his current age: J + 5 = 27.

Solving for J, we get J = 22.

In 8 years, James' cousin will be 5 years younger than twice James' age. We can write an equation for this: C + 8 = 2(J + 8) - 5.

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get C + 8 = 2(22 + 8) - 5.
C + 8 = 2(30) - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 47

Now, we can find the age difference between James and his cousin: |J - C| = |22 - 47| = 25.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$"
"To determine the cost of one monitor, we can start by finding the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

Since the total cost of all three items is $2,400, the cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the monitors by 2: $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The final answer is: $300"
"To determine the number of seashells brought by each girl, we can start by finding the total number of seashells brought by the girls. Since the boys brought 60 shells each and there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10 * 60 = 600.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as 60 + 4 * 60. 

60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300

Now, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls. There are 10 girls, so each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30 seashells.

The final answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of candies Nick had initially as 'N' and the number of candies George had initially as 'G'. We know that Nick had twice as many candies as George, so we can write the equation:

N = 2G

We also know that George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so we can write another equation:

G = 3 + 5
G = 8

Now that we know George had 8 candies initially, we can substitute this value into the first equation:

N = 2G
N = 2(8)
N = 16

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

The final answer is: 16"
"To determine Anne's age, we can follow the given information:

Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. This means Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age: 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the total thickness of the four books, we can simply add their individual thicknesses together.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thickness of all four books together:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To determine the number of vlogs Emma needs to make to complete 72 vlogs per month, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

Next, we subtract the total number of vlogs made from the target number of vlogs: 72 - 54 = 18.

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete 72 vlogs per month.

The final answer is: 18"
"To calculate the total amount you paid, we need to find 20% of the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 can be calculated as 0.20 * $50 = $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The eldest boy adds $5 to his share, making his total $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10 to his total, making it $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spends $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

He saves some more money and triples the amount he had left after spending $8. This means he now has 3 times the amount he had after spending $8, which is 3 * $13 = $39.

The final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month as x. Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, the amount he saves in the second half is 2x.

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 1125

Combine like terms:

3x = 1125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 375

Now that we know Elvis saves $375 in the first half of the month, we can find the amount he saves in the second half by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2 * 375 = 750

Since there are 15 days in the second half of the month, we can divide the total savings for the second half by 15 to find out how much Elvis has to save each day:

750 ÷ 15 = 50

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 per day in the second half of the month.

Final answer: $50"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of Apples * Price per Apple) + (Number of Oranges * Price per Orange) + (Number of Peaches * Price per Peach)

Plugging in the values given in the problem:

Total Cost = (3 * $1.50) + (5 * $0.80) + (6 * $0.75)
Total Cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
Total Cost = $13.00

Since Verna gave $20, the change she received is:

Change = $20 - $13.00
Change = $7.00

The final answer is $7.00."
"To calculate the difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny, we can use the following formula:

Earnings Difference = (Jairus' Earnings - Jenny's Earnings)

Given that Jairus earns $0.8 per task and Jenny earns $0.5 per task, we can plug in the values as follows:

Earnings Difference = ($0.8 x 20) - ($0.5 x 20)
Earnings Difference = $16 - $10
Earnings Difference = $6

Therefore, Jairus will earn $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is: $6"
"Let's dive into the world of algebra to solve this problem. As someone who appreciates the beauty of blue, I find the concept of ratios and proportions fascinating. In this case, we're dealing with a simple ratio of 1:4 between Jeff and Brad's shares.

We know that the total amount of money is $100, and we want to find out how much Jeff gets. Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. If Brad gets x dollars, then Jeff gets 4x dollars. Since the total amount is $100, we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

Now that we know Brad gets $20, we can find Jeff's share by multiplying x by 4:

Jeff's share = 4x
= 4(20)
= 80

Therefore, Jeff gets $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To calculate the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to consider the round-trip distance to and from work. 

The distance to work is 3 miles, and since Jeff walks back home as well, the total distance walked each day is 2 times the distance to work. 

Distance walked each day = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles

Number of days worked per week = 5

Total miles walked per week = 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week

"In this scenario, we're dealing with a classic example of a growing sequence, where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant. In this case, the constant is 3.

Let's denote the number of families notified in the nth round as F(n). We can express F(n) as:

F(n) = 3F(n-1)

Since Ali starts with 3 families in the first round, we can write:

F(1) = 3

To find the number of families notified in the fourth round, we need to find F(4). We can calculate it as follows:

F(2) = 3F(1) = 3(3) = 9
F(3) = 3F(2) = 3(9) = 27
F(4) = 3F(3) = 3(27) = 81

Therefore, the number of families notified in the fourth round is 81.

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$"
"To determine Mark's initial weight, we can use the concept of linear decline. Since Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, we can calculate his initial weight by adding the total weight lost to his final weight.

Let's break it down:

Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
Number of months = 3
Final weight = 70 pounds

Initial weight = Final weight + (Weight lost per month * Number of months)
Initial weight = 70 + (10 * 3)
Initial weight = 70 + 30
Initial weight = 100

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to calculate the number of toys he needs to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a set five times larger would have 5 * 80 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this, so he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys.

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 402 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{402}$"
"As an engineering student, I can help you calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy. To do this, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then apply the 10% discount.

The cost of 2 pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
The cost of 1 calculator = $12
The cost of 1 geometry set = $10

Total cost of all items = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

Now, we need to apply the 10% discount. 
10% of $30 = 0.1 * $30 = $3
Discount amount = $3
Total cost after discount = $30 - $3 = $27

"As a marketing expert, I can break down the commission calculation into two parts: the base commission and the additional commission for sales over $1000.

The base commission for sales up to $1000 is calculated as 30% of the sales amount, which is $1000. This can be expressed as:

Base Commission = 0.3 * $1000 = $300

The additional commission for sales over $1000 is calculated as 10% of the amount exceeding $1000, which is $1500. This can be expressed as:

Additional Commission = 0.1 * ($2500 - $1000) = 0.1 * $1500 = $150

Total Commission = Base Commission + Additional Commission
= $300 + $150
= $450

Therefore, Antonella earned a total commission of $450."

"To determine the time difference between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes. To find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply the time it takes to swim 1 mile by 3:
3 × 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. First, we find the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day:
2 × 16 = 32
32 + 2 = 34 minutes

Now, we multiply the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day by 3:
3 × 34 = 102 minutes

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day from the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes

"To find the total number of holes in the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes and the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

Let's denote the total number of buttons with two holes as 'x' and the total number of buttons with four holes as 'y'. We know that x + y = 14 (since there are 14 buttons with four holes). We also know that the total number of buttons is 21.

We can set up the equation: x + y = 21

We are given that 7 buttons have two holes, so x = 7.

Now, we can substitute x into the equation: 7 + y = 21

Solving for y, we get: y = 14

Now, we can calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with two holes: 7 x 2 = 14

The total number of holes in the buttons with four holes is 14 x 4 = 56

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 14 + 56 = 70

"To determine the size of Peter's locker, we need to understand the relationships between the locker sizes. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can calculate Zack's locker size by dividing Timothy's locker size by 2.

Let's denote Timothy's locker size as T and Zack's locker size as Z. We know that Z = T/2. Given that Timothy's locker size is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate Zack's locker size as:

Z = 24 / 2
Z = 12 cubic inches

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. To find the size of Peter's locker, we can multiply Zack's locker size by 1/4.

Peter's locker size = Z * (1/4)

"As a rodent behaviorist, I can confidently calculate the total number of rodents in the pet shop.

To determine the total number of rodents, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. Since there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we can use the following formula:

Total number of rodents = (Number of hamster cages * Number of hamsters per cage) + (Number of guinea pig cages * Number of guinea pigs per cage)
= (3 * 10) + (3 * 5)
= 30 + 15
= 45

Therefore, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"To find the average weight of the three friends, we can use the formula for average:

Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / 3

Given Mark's weight is 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20
Susan's weight = 150 - 20
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Bob's weight is twice as much as Susan's weight:
Bob's weight = 2 * Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 * 130
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, we can find the average weight by adding their weights and dividing by 3:
Average weight = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
Average weight = 540 / 3
Average weight = 180

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in the first week and add it to the pages read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the pages read in the first week. Since Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week, we can find the total minutes she read in the first week by multiplying the minutes per night by the number of nights.

Total minutes in the first week = 15 minutes/night * 7 nights = 105 minutes

Next, we need to convert the total minutes to pages. Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find the number of pages she read in 105 minutes, we can divide 105 by 1.5 and multiply the result by 2.

Pages read in the first week = (105 minutes / 1.5 minutes/page) * 2 pages/minute
Pages read in the first week = (70) * 2
Pages read in the first week = 140 pages

Now, we can add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week to find the total number of pages read in two weeks.

Total pages read in two weeks = Pages read in the first week + Pages read in the second week
Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages + 100 pages
Total pages read in two weeks = 240 pages

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationship between Shiloh's and his nephew's ages.

Let's denote Shiloh's current age as S and his nephew's current age as N. We know that Shiloh is 44 years old today, so S = 44.

In 7 years, Shiloh will be S + 7 years old, and his nephew will be N + 7 years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be represented by the equation:

S + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Substituting S = 44, we get:

44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)

Simplifying the equation:

51 = 3N + 21

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

30 = 3N

Dividing both sides by 3:

10 = N

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is 10 years old today.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna. We also know that Richie scored 80 goals. 

To find the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna, we can set up two equations:

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M and the number of goals scored by Anna as A.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write an equation:
M + 20 = 80

Simplifying the equation, we get:
M = 80 - 20
M = 60

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write another equation:
A + 45 = 80

Simplifying the equation, we get:
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Now that we know the number of goals scored by each teenager, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three:
Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35
Total goals = 175

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate his daily expenditure and the remaining amount.

Peter has $70 initially and spends an equal amount each day for one week. From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $5 each day, so his total expenditure for these days is:
$5 * 3 = $15

He has $70 - $15 = $55 left.

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has $55 left, so he can buy:
$55 / $2 = 27.5

Since he can't buy half a figure, he will buy 27 plastic action figures.

In total, Peter will have:
3 wooden action figures (from Sunday to Wednesday)
+ 27 plastic action figures (from Thursday to Saturday)

Total action figures = 3 + 27 = 30

The final answer is 30."
"To calculate the total cost of the kitten, we need to consider the expenses incurred.

"To determine the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses required and compare it to the number of roses he grows.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses he grows per week by 4 to find the total roses he grows in a month:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses per week. To find the total roses needed per week, we add the number of roses ordered by each shop:
20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses = 65 roses/week

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total roses needed per week by 4 to find the total roses needed per month:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Now, we subtract the number of roses Ford grows in a month from the total roses needed per month to find the number of roses he lacks:
260 roses/month - 160 roses/month = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Total revenue = 10 * $7.00
Total revenue = $70.00

Total cost:
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of loaves needed for 10 sandwiches = 1
Cost of bread = Number of loaves * Cost of bread per loaf
Cost of bread = 1 * $3.00
Cost of bread = $3.00

Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00
Total cost = $33.00

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00
Net profit = $37.00

The final answer is: $37.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

To find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make, we need to first find out how many crayons she has. Since there are 3 boxes of 64 crayons, we multiply 3 by 64.

3 * 64 = 192

Since Kate melts 8 small pieces of crayons together, we divide the total number of crayons by 8.

192 ÷ 8 = 24

So, Kate can make 24 muffin crayons. To find out how much money she can make, we multiply the number of muffin crayons by the price per muffin.

24 * $1.50 = $36

The final answer is $36."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to consider the costs of the carpet, padding, removal, and installation.

The area of the room is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

The cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12 per square foot = $2592.

The cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2 per square foot = $432.

The cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4 per square foot = $864.

The cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34 per square foot = $7344.

The total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $10512.

Therefore, the total cost to replace the carpet in Michael's bedroom is $10512."
"To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the 7 days and divide by 7.

Let's break it down:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
= 280

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / 7
= 280 / 7
= 40

The final answer is 40."
"To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given steps:

The starting value is 20. We are asked to find the result of the expression: ((20 + (20/2)) / 5) * (20 - 12).

First, we calculate the expression inside the parentheses: 20/2 = 10. Then, we add 20 to the result: 20 + 10 = 30. Next, we divide the result by 5: 30 / 5 = 6. Finally, we multiply the result by 20 - 12: 6 * 8 = 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."
"To find the total number of cards, we need to add the number of cards the boy has (5) to the number of cards his brother has. Since his brother has 3 fewer cards, we can represent this as:

Number of cards the boy has + (Number of cards the boy has - 3)

This can be simplified to:

5 + (5 - 3)

Using the order of operations, we first subtract 3 from 5:

5 - 3 = 2

Then, we add 5 to the result:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7.

The final answer is: 7"
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. 

The oven is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees off. 
To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the original temperature and multiply by 100: 
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Since the oven is 4% off, we need to find 4% of 520. 
4% of 520 = 0.04 * 520 = 20.8

So, Maggie should set the oven to 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees.

The correct answer is: 540.8"
"To calculate the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the length of the first movie (1 hour and 30 minutes) to the length of the second movie (2 hours and 5 minutes).

First, we convert both times to minutes:
1 hour and 30 minutes = 90 minutes
2 hours and 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, we add the two times:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To calculate the combined value of the two houses, we need to find the value of Juan's house first. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate this by finding 30% of Herb's house value and subtracting it from Herb's house value.

Herb's house value: $76,000
30% of Herb's house value: 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800
Juan's house value: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

Now, let's add the values of both houses to find the combined value:
$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

The final answer is: $129,200"
"To determine the total number of utensils, we need to calculate the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy initially bought a dozen (12) cups. Since she bought twice as many dishes as cups, she brought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups is 12 (Judy) + 40 (friend) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes is 24 (Judy) + 44 (friend) = 68 dishes.

The total number of utensils is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"As a contact lens expert, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the cost of each pair of contacts.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts. Since each box is currently 10% off, we'll calculate the discounted price of 1 box and then multiply it by 2.

The original price of 1 box is $100.00, and the discount is 10% of $100.00, which is $10.00. The discounted price of 1 box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

The total cost of 2 boxes is 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.

Since 1 box contains 90 pairs of contacts, 2 boxes will contain 2 x 90 = 180 pairs.

To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of pairs:

Cost per pair = $180.00 ÷ 180 pairs
= $1.00 per pair

The final answer is: $1.00"
"Let's dive into the world of hourly wage calculations.

To determine the earnings of Tabitha's helpers, we need to calculate their individual hours worked and multiply it by the hourly wage of $10.

Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours. To find Jill's total earnings, we multiply her hours worked by the hourly wage: 3 * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. John's total hours worked is 4 + 3 = 7 hours. To find John's total earnings, we multiply his hours worked by the hourly wage: 7 * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we must first determine the total calories burned during her activities. 

Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. 

Total calories burned = (500 calories/hour * 2 hours) + (600 calories/hour * 1 hour)
Total calories burned = 1000 + 600
Total calories burned = 1600 calories

Since Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can divide the total calories burned by 200 to find out how many 200-calorie units she burned.

200 calorie units = 1600 / 200
200 calorie units = 8

Since each unit requires 100 ml of water, we multiply the number of units by 100.

Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

The final answer is: 800"
"The art of jelly bean conundrums! As a connoisseur of all things blue, I'm delighted to dive into this problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We're given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, and the relationship between the colors is as follows:

- Red jelly beans are 1% fewer than blue jelly beans.
- Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue jelly beans.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B, and the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the three colors, which equals 4500:

B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500

Combine like terms:

2B + 0.99B = 4500

Simplify:

2.99B = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99:

B = 1500

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

R = 0.99B
R = 0.99(1500)
R = 1485

And the number of green jelly beans:

G = 1.01B
G = 1.01(1500)
G = 1509

To find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

G - R = 1509 - 1485
G - R = 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"To calculate the average of Jared's typing speeds, we need to add the three measurements and divide by 3.

Initial speed: 47 WPM
Increased speed: 52 WPM
New speed: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, let's add the three speeds:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

To find the average, divide the sum by 3:
156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52."
"To determine the difference in weight between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the weight gained or lost in 5 weeks for each option.

The weight lost or gained per week is as follows:

- Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week
- Donuts: +1.75 pounds/week

The difference in weight between the two options can be calculated by multiplying the weight change per week by the number of weeks:

Weight difference = (1.75 - (-1.25)) * 5
Weight difference = (1.75 + 1.25) * 5
Weight difference = 3 * 5
Weight difference = 15

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To determine the total number of people attending the event, we need to consider the number of people initially invited by Alex, the number of additional friends she invited, and the number of friends' spouses.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Alex initially invited 100 people.
2. Each of the 100 people invited brought 2 friends, so the total number of additional friends is 100 * 2 = 200.
3. Alex directly invited 10 friends, and 8 of them brought their spouses, so the total number of additional people (friends and spouses) is 10 + 8 = 18.
4. Now, we add up all the people: 100 (initially invited) + 200 (friends) + 18 (friends' spouses) = 318.

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats for the event.

318"
"As a canine nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the weights of the dogs in the waiting room.

The weights of the dogs are related in a specific sequence. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is 220 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{220}$"
"To determine the cost difference between Amazon and eBay, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both platforms.

The boots cost $16 on Amazon, and shipping costs $4. On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much, which is 2 * $4 = $8.

Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

The difference in cost between Amazon and eBay is $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"The problem at hand involves exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula for exponential functions. Given that the initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet and it doubles every day, we can express this growth using the formula:

h(t) = 4 * 2^t

where h(t) is the height of the beanstalk at time t (in days).

To find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window (20 feet), we need to solve for t when h(t) > 20.

4 * 2^t > 20

Dividing both sides by 4:

2^t > 5

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

t > log2(5)

Using a calculator to approximate the value of log2(5), we get:

t > 2.32

Since t must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a day), the smallest integer value of t that satisfies the inequality is 3.

Therefore, it will take at least 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is: 3"
"To calculate the total grams of protein John gets per week, we need to multiply the grams of protein he gets per day by 7.

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein, we can set up a proportion to find the grams of protein per day.

Let x be the grams of protein per day. We can set up the proportion as follows:

200 grams of mushrooms / 3 grams of protein per cup = x grams of protein per day

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 grams of protein per cup:

x = (200 grams of mushrooms * 3 grams of protein per cup) / 1

x = 600 grams of protein per day

Now, we can multiply the grams of protein per day by 7 to find the total grams of protein per week:

x * 7 = 600 grams of protein per day * 7
x * 7 = 4200 grams of protein per week

The final answer is: 4200"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's represent Jerry's current age as 'x'. Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

0 = x - 10

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

10 = x

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find Jerry's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

x + 3 = 10 + 3
x + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: 13"
"To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to consider the base price of the implants and the additional cost of the crown. The base price of each implant is $2000, and George needs 2 implants, so the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

The crown costs an extra $500, so the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so he still needs $4500 - $600 = $3900.

To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining amount, we can divide the amount he still needs ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15):

$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work for 260 hours to cover the remaining amount.

The final answer is: 260"
"In the context of geometry, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is a fundamental concept. When one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle, we can represent the angles as x, 2x, and 3x, respectively.

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles:

2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees
3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{90}$"
"To determine the total number of gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has.

Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 x $0.25 = $2.
He has 6 dimes, which is 6 x $0.10 = $0.60.
He has 14 nickels, which is 14 x $0.05 = $0.70.
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 x $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's add up the total amount of money: $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45.

Since each gumball costs $0.05, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a gumball to find out how many he can buy: $3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69.

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"As a zoologist specializing in animal behavior and physiology, I can provide a precise calculation for the total number of legs in the pet store.

To determine the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and add them together. 

Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs.
Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs.
Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add the total number of legs together: 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) = 48 legs.

The total number of legs in the store is 48."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. To find the weight he uses after increasing it by 50%, we need to calculate 50% of 8 pounds.

50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds

The weight Jamaal initially increased by 50% is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. However, he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. To find the final weight, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds.

12 - 2 = 10 pounds

Therefore, Jamaal now uses a weight of 10 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"Let's break down Steve's game collection over the three years.

In the first year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This totals to 5 + 12 = 17 games.

In the second year, Steve receives another 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 12 games at a rate of 1 game per month. This totals to 5 + 12 = 17 games. Additionally, he receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 17 + 5 = 22 games.

In the third year, Steve receives 5 games as a birthday gift and buys 24 games at a rate of 2 games per month. This totals to 5 + 24 = 29 games. He also receives 5 games as a Christmas gift, bringing the total to 29 + 5 = 34 games.

To find the total number of games Steve has after three years, we can simply add the number of games from each year: 17 + 22 + 34 = 73 games.

The final answer is: $\boxed{73}$"
"To determine the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its rate as follows:

Rate = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Rate = 400 miles per hour

Now, we can use this rate to find the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Final answer: $\boxed{5}$"
"To calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours, we need to find their individual hourly production rates and then multiply those rates by 12.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his hourly production rate is 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz in an hour. To find her hourly production rate, we multiply Ruiz's rate by 3/4: (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of chocolates they make in 12 hours:
Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds.
Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

The total amount of chocolates they made together is 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1260}$"
"Let's break down Howard's spending pattern to determine how much money he has left.

On Monday, Howard spent $8 at the arcade. This is a straightforward transaction.

On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 x $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is 4 x $16 = $64.

To find the total amount spent, we add the individual amounts: $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

Since Howard originally had $100, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount to find the amount left: $100 - $88 = $12.

The final answer is $12."
"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade, we can break down the problem into two periods: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. This can be calculated as:

15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30

For the next 2 hours, Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. This can be calculated as:

10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12

The total earnings can be found by adding the earnings from both periods:

$30 + $12 = $42

The final answer is: $42"
"As a tire expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the tire's lifespan.

To determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced, we need to calculate the total number of rotations and then divide it by the maximum number of rotations the tire can undergo.

Given that the tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:

725 rotations / 2 miles = 362.5 rotations/mile

Now, let's calculate the total number of rotations per month:
362.5 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month = 145,000 rotations/month

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total number of rotations per month by 12:
145,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,740,000 rotations/year

Finally, we divide the total number of rotations the tire can undergo by the total number of rotations per year:
10,440,000 rotations / 1,740,000 rotations/year = 6 years

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in 6 years.

"To determine the cost of each pump, we can use the given information. The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00, and 2 pumps provide 120 washings. 

First, we find the cost per washing: 
Cost per 120 washings = $24.00
Cost per washing = $24.00 / 120 = $0.20

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by 1:
Cost per pump = $0.20 / 1 = $0.20

To convert the cost from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:
Cost per pump = $0.20 * 100 = 20 cents

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total cost of the outfit, we need to first find the discount on the shirt. The discount is 30% of the original price of $25. 

The discount amount is $25 * 0.3 = $7.50.

The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

The total cost of the outfit is the sum of the discounted shirt and the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Since sales tax is included, we need to calculate the tax amount. Assuming an 8% sales tax rate, the tax amount is $52.50 * 0.08 = $4.20.

The total cost of the outfit with tax is $52.50 + $4.20 = $56.70.

Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $56.70 = -$6.70 left after the purchase.

The final amount Joe will have left is -$6.70."
"To determine the total amount of butter needed, we can multiply the number of croissants by the amount of butter required per dozen. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we can set up the following equation:

Butter needed per day = 4 dozen croissants/day * (1/4 pound/dozen)
Butter needed per day = 4 * (1/4) pound
Butter needed per day = 1 pound

Since Juan wants to make croissants for 7 days, we can multiply the daily amount by 7:

Total butter needed = Butter needed per day * 7
Total butter needed = 1 pound * 7
Total butter needed = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants per day for a week.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"As a civil engineer specializing in pavement design and construction, I can provide a precise calculation for the cost difference between repaving two streets with different lengths.

Given:
- Cost per meter: $194
- Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
- Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

To find the cost of repaving Lewis' street, we multiply the cost per meter by the length of his street:

Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $194 * 490
Cost of repaving Lewis' street = $94,660

Next, we calculate the cost of repaving Monica's street:

Cost of repaving Monica's street = $194 * 150
Cost of repaving Monica's street = $29,100

Now, we find the difference in cost by subtracting the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

Difference in cost = Cost of repaving Lewis' street - Cost of repaving Monica's street
Difference in cost = $94,660 - $29,100
Difference in cost = $65,560

Therefore, it costs $65,560 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

"As a researcher in the field of biotechnology, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs associated with John's cancer cell research project.

The initial funding for the first 5 months was $100,000 per month, totaling $500,000. This represents a fixed cost for the initial phase of the research.

For the remaining 5 months, the funding increased by 50% each month. This is a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula:

Funding (t) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(t-5)

where t is the month number, starting from 6.

We can calculate the funding for each of the remaining 5 months as follows:

- Month 6: Funding (6) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(6-5) = 100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: Funding (7) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(7-5) = 100,000 * 2.25 = $225,000
- Month 8: Funding (8) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(8-5) = 100,000 * 3.375 = $337,500
- Month 9: Funding (9) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(9-5) = 100,000 * 5.0625 = $506,250
- Month 10: Funding (10) = 100,000 * (1.5)^(10-5) = 100,000 * 7.59375 = $759,375

Now, we add up the funding for all 10 months:
$500,000 + $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $2,077,625

The total cost of John's research is $2,077,625.

The final answer is: $2,077,625"
"To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to consider the ounces of meat each player ate.

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size, so the total ounces of beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is equal to 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).

Since the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed:
6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 30 ounces

The total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To calculate the total number of posts in March, we need to consider the average number of posts per day and the number of days in the month. 

The Reddit group has 1000 members, and each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. To find the total number of posts in March, we can multiply the number of members by the average number of posts per day and then multiply by the number of days in March.

Total number of posts in March = Number of members * Average posts per day * Number of days in March
Total number of posts in March = 1000 * 3 * 31

Total number of posts in March = 93,000

The total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"As a water conservation expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate Gary's annual water expenditure on laundry.

To determine the total cost of water for laundry, we need to calculate the total gallons of water used per year and then multiply it by the cost per gallon. 

Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year, he does laundry 52 weeks * 2 = 104 times. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used per year is 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons.

The cost of a gallon of water is $0.15, so the total cost of water for laundry in a year is 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

The final answer is: $312"

The total amount Scarlett spent is $33.00."
"The height of the beanstalk can be calculated by adding the growth in each week. 

The initial height of the beanstalk is 3 inches. In the second week, it doubled in height, resulting in 3 * 2 = 6 inches. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. 

To find the total height after 3 weeks, we add the growth in each week: 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 inches.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 13 inches."
"To determine the number of days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day and then divide the total weight of the bull by that amount.

As a butcher, I can tell you that Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour he works. Since he works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells per day is 15kg/hour * 10 hours = 150kg.

Now, we can divide the total weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150kg) to find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat.

750kg ÷ 150kg per day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the number of students in the school auditorium, we need to calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators and parents, and then subtract that from the total number of seats.

First, we find the number of seats occupied by administrators:
Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats
Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * 1/4 = 18 seats

Next, we find the number of seats occupied by parents:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 54 seats = 0 seats

However, this result doesn't make sense, as there must be some students present. Let's re-evaluate the calculation.

The correct calculation is:
Seats occupied by parents = 72 seats * 1/3 = 24 seats

Now, we find the number of seats occupied by students:
Seats occupied by students = 72 seats - 18 seats - 24 seats = 30 seats

The number of students in the school auditorium is 30."
"To calculate the total number of functioning street lights, we need to first find the total number of street lights. 

There are 4 street lights at each pole, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24.

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is 24 * 4 = 96.

Now, we need to subtract the number of non-functioning street lights. There are 20 non-functioning street lights. 

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played, we need to add the number of times each DVD has been played.

Let's calculate the remaining playtime for each DVD:

DVD 1: 1000 - 356 = 644 times left
DVD 2: 1000 - 135 = 865 times left

Total number of times both DVDs can be played: 644 + 865 = 1509

"To determine the number of pieces of gum Jim has left, we can break down his gum-chewing activities throughout the day.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours and he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours, we can calculate the total number of pieces chewed at school as follows:

8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces

Additionally, Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, adding 2 more pieces to the total.

Total pieces chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces

Initially, Jim had 20 pieces of gum. After chewing 6 pieces, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

Finally, Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. Half of 14 is 7, so he gives 7 pieces to his sister.

The final number of pieces of gum Jim has left is 14 - 7 = 7.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to calculate her current age. Since she will be 16 in 12 years, we can find her current age by subtracting 12 from 16.

16 - 12 = 4

"Let's dive into the world of sports finance. As a sports enthusiast and a keen observer of team dynamics, I'd like to break down the numbers for you.

The baseball coach purchased 9 baseballs at $3 each, resulting in a total expenditure of $27. This can be represented as:

9 × $3 = $27

On the other hand, the basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, leading to a total expenditure of $112. This can be calculated as:

8 × $14 = $112

To determine how much more the basketball coach spent, we need to find the difference between the two amounts:

$112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

The final answer is: $85"
"To determine the number of bloomed flowers in Arianna's garden, we can multiply the total number of flowers by the fraction that have bloomed.

Total flowers = 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers
Fraction bloomed = 4/5

Number of bloomed flowers = Total flowers * Fraction bloomed
= 200 * 4/5
= 200 * 0.8
= 160

Therefore, the number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is 160.

Final answer: 160"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second and then multiply by the number of seconds in an hour.

First, we convert 20 kb to Mb: 20 kb ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the speed by 60:
0.02 Mb/second × 60 seconds/minute × 60 minutes/hour = 0.02 × 60 × 60 Mb/hour
= 72 Mb/hour

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"As a transportation expert, I can break down the problem into manageable parts to calculate the total number of cars towed that week.

Let's start by calculating the number of cars towed on the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day, we can multiply the number of cars per day by the number of days:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, we need to calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days. The problem states that the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, so we subtract 4 from the original 10 cars per day:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Now, we multiply the new number of cars per day by the number of remaining days (4 days):

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

To find the total number of cars towed that week, we add the number of cars towed on the first three days and the remaining days:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The final answer is: 54"
"To determine the number of years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to calculate the difference between the required height and his current height, then divide by his annual growth rate.

The required height is 4 feet, which is equivalent to 48 inches. Adam's current height is 40 inches. The difference is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we can divide the difference by his growth rate to find the number of years it will take for him to reach the required height: 8 inches / 2 inches/year = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

Final answer: 4"
"As a seasoned automotive finance expert, I can break down the problem step by step.

To calculate James' earnings, we need to determine the profit first. The company paid 30% of the purchase price to acquire the cars, which is 0.3 * $25,000 = $7,500 per vehicle.

The profit per car is the selling price minus the cost: $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

Since James sold 10 cars, the total profit is 10 * $17,500 = $175,000.

Next, we need to calculate James' commission, which is 10% of the profits. This can be calculated as 0.1 * $175,000 = $17,500.

Therefore, James made $17,500.

The final answer is: $17,500"
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to calculate 25% of the total number of riders, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25. 

Since 60% of these riders are women, we can find the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying 25 by 0.6, which equals 15. 

The remaining riders who are men can be found by subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright: 25 - 15 = 10.

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

The final answer is 10."
"As a jewelry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem.

Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of a gold jewel, which is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.

Price of gold jewel = (4/5) * Price of diamond jewel
= (4/5) * $2000
= $1600

The cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we can calculate the price of a silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
= $1600 - $400
= $1200

To find the total price of all three jewels, we can add their individual prices:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
= $2000 + $1600 + $1200
= $4800

The final answer is: $4800"
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of snowflake stamps as S, the number of truck stamps as T, and the number of rose stamps as R.

We know that S = 16 (given). We also know that T = S + 3 and R = T - 9.

Substituting the value of S into the equation for T, we get T = 16 + 3 = 19.

Substituting the value of T into the equation for R, we get R = 19 - 9 = 10.

Now, we can find the total number of stamps by adding S, T, and R together: Total = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since Bob is driving 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them.

Let's denote the time it takes for Tom to catch up as 't' hours. In this time, Bob will cover a distance of 55t miles, and Tom will cover a distance of 70t miles. Since Tom needs to catch up with Bob, the distance between them should be zero when Tom catches up.

We can set up the equation: 55t - 70t = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get: -15t = 0

Dividing both sides by -15, we get: t = 0

However, this is not possible since Tom needs to catch up with Bob. Let's re-examine the equation.

The correct equation should be: 75 = 70t

Dividing both sides by 70, we get: t = 75/70

t = 1.07 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 1 hour and 4 minutes to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: 1.07"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of fish caught by Naomi as N, the number caught by Darren as D, and the number caught by Tommy as T.

We are given that Naomi caught 17 fish, so N = 17.

We also know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so D = N - 6.

Substituting the value of N, we get D = 17 - 6 = 11.

Now, we are told that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so T = D + 3.

Substituting the value of D, we get T = 11 + 3 = 14.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to consider the total cost of the classes and the maximum cost per class.

The total cost of the classes is $60, and the maximum cost per class is $10. To find the maximum number of classes they are willing to pay for, we can divide the total cost by the maximum cost per class.

Let's calculate the maximum number of classes: 

$60 ÷ $10 = 6 classes

Since Manny has already signed up for 10 classes, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before exceeding the maximum cost. To do this, we subtract the number of classes his parents are willing to pay for from the total number of classes:

10 (total classes) - 6 (maximum classes) = 4 classes

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total weekly production, we need to first find the daily production of Julie and Jewel.

Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers per day.

The total daily production is 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

Since they work all 7 days of the week, the total weekly production is 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.

The final answer is: 1050"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote the number of miles Lynn ran as 'L'. Since Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles. We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so we can set up the equation:

20 = L + 3

To find the value of L, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

L = 20 - 3
L = 17

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles.

The final answer is: 17"
"To calculate the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can use the given prices and multiply the quantity of each item by its respective price.

The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $5.20 = $26.00
The cost of 5 oranges is 5 x $3.30 = $16.50

The total cost is $26.00 + $16.50 = $42.50

Therefore, Clyde will pay $42.50 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to find the volume of the hole and then multiply it by the time it takes to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

The volume of a rectangular prism (such as the hole) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth is 3 feet.

Volume = length * width * depth
Volume = 6 * 4 * 3
Volume = 72 cubic feet

Since it takes 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we multiply the volume by 3.

Time = Volume * 3
Time = 72 * 3
Time = 216 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The final answer is: $\boxed{216}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to consider the base price and the additional features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an additional $7,500, the leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $2,500, the running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,000, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Let's calculate the total cost:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) = $37,500
$37,500 + $2,500 (leather seats) = $40,000
$40,000 + $2,000 (running boards) = $42,000
$42,000 + $1,500 (upgraded exterior light package) = $43,500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"To calculate Tim's new salary, we need to first calculate the raise and bonus.

The raise is 5% of his current monthly salary of $20,000. This can be calculated as:

Raise = 0.05 x $20,000 = $1,000

The bonus is half a month's salary, which is:

Bonus = $20,000 / 2 = $10,000

Now, we add the raise and bonus to his current monthly salary to get his new monthly salary:

New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To calculate the yearly salary, we multiply the new monthly salary by 12:

Yearly salary = $31,000 x 12 = $372,000

The final answer is: $372,000"

Total articles published by the news website = 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles
Total articles published by the sister company = 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:
Total articles = 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840."
"To determine the age of Steve's son's wife, we can break down the information step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so the son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to calculate the number of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

Since Howie wants to get one of each flavor (vanilla and chocolate) for everyone, we'll multiply the number of people by 2.

Number of people = 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27

Total number of cupcakes = 27 x 2 = 54

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"To find the total number of likes, we need to calculate the initial number of likes and then add the new likes.

Let's denote the initial number of likes as x. Since the number of likes after three weeks is 70 times the initial number of likes, we can set up the equation:

x + 20000 = 70x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

20000 = 69x

Dividing both sides by 69:

x = 20000 / 69
x = 288.5

Now, we add the 20000 new likes to the initial likes to find the total number of likes:

Total likes = x + 20000
Total likes = 288.5 + 20000
Total likes = 20128.5

The final answer is 20129."
"The problem at hand involves calculating the difference in the final prices paid for pomegranates on two different days. To approach this, we need to consider the initial cost, discount, and final price for each day.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, but she received a $2 discount. The total cost on Tuesday can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost (Tuesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - Discount
= (20 * $20) - $2
= $400 - $2
= $398

On Wednesday, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, and the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The total cost on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost (Wednesday) = (Number of Pomegranates * Price per Pomegranate) - (Discount Percentage * Total Cost)
= (20 * $30) - (0.1 * $600)
= $600 - $60
= $540

The difference in the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

= $398 - $540
= -$142

The final answer is: $142"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. This means the sales from green hats in the first month were 2 x $400 = $800.

To find the total sales in the first month, we add the sales from red hats and green hats: $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. To find the sales in the second month, we multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4: 3/4 x $1200 = $900.

The total sales in two months are the sum of the sales in the first and second months: $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"To calculate the total cost of the horse-drawn carriage rental, we need to consider the time period and the hourly rates.

The carriage rental period is from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, James receives 1 hour of free time, so the number of paid hours is 4 - 1 = 3 hours.

The cost of the first paid hour is $15. Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the first hour, so the cost of the remaining 2 hours is 2 * $15 = $30.

The total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

The final answer is: $45"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Sally's bank account balance increased from $200 to $420, which means she received $220 more than her weekly wage. Since her weekly wage should be $300, we can calculate the amount withheld by subtracting the wage from the increase in her bank account balance.

Let's denote the amount withheld as x. We can set up the equation:

$300 (weekly wage) + x (amount withheld) = $220 (increase in bank account balance)

To find the amount withheld, we can subtract $300 from both sides of the equation:

x = $220 - $300
x = -$80

Since the amount withheld cannot be negative, we can re-examine the problem. Let's re-evaluate the increase in her bank account balance:

$420 (final balance) - $200 (initial balance) = $220 (increase)

This means that the increase in her bank account balance is $220. Since her weekly wage is $300, the amount withheld can be calculated as:

$300 (weekly wage) - $220 (increase) = $80

The amount withheld from Sally's wage is $80.

The final answer is: $80"
"To determine the number of eggs needed for the party, we can use a simple multiplication problem. Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, and each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves. With 16 guests attending, the total number of deviled egg halves required is:

16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since 2 deviled egg halves are needed per egg, we can divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2 to find the total number of eggs required:

48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 eggs

To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we can divide by 12:

24 eggs / 12 = 2 dozen eggs

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of pages Shiela has left to write, we can calculate the fraction of the paper she has completed and subtract it from 1.

Since Shiela has completed 1/3 of the paper, she has 2/3 of the paper left to write. 

To find 2/3 of 15, we can multiply 15 by 2 and divide by 3.

2/3 of 15 = (2 * 15) / 3
= 30 / 3
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the number of days it will take Mike to finish the book, we can use the formula:

Number of days = Total pages / Pages per day

Given that the total number of pages is 200 and Mike plans to read 10 pages per day, we can plug in the values as follows:

Number of days = 200 / 10
= 20

Since Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, we can calculate the number of days before the deadline as follows:

Days before deadline = Deadline - Number of days
= 30 - 20
= 10

Therefore, Mike will finish the book 10 days before the deadline."
"To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price, monthly rent, and monthly fuel cost.

The initial purchase price of the plane is $150,000.

The monthly rent is $5,000.

The monthly fuel cost is twice the monthly rent, which is $5,000 x 2 = $10,000.

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the plane for the first year is $150,000 (plane cost) + $180,000 (total monthly cost) = $330,000.

The final answer is: $330,000"
"To determine the total cooking time, we can start by finding the cooking time for beans. Since beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can calculate the cooking time for beans as follows:

Let's denote the cooking time for pork as P and the cooking time for rice as R. We know that R = 30 minutes. We also know that P = R + 20, so P = 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.

The cooking time for beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is (P + R) / 2. Substituting the values, we get (50 + 30) / 2 = 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

Now, we can find the total cooking time by adding the cooking times for all three foods: R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the cost difference between the two mixtures, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the cost of 1 pound of almonds as A and the cost of 1 pound of walnuts as W.

We are given that A = $10 and W = $15.

The cost of the first mixture is 1/2A + 1/3W, and the cost of the second mixture is 1/5A + 1/3W.

To find the difference in cost, we can set up the following equation:

(1/2A + 1/3W) - (1/5A + 1/3W) = ?

First, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

(1/2A - 1/5A) + (1/3W - 1/3W) = ?

This simplifies to:

(3/10A) + 0 = ?

Since 1/3W - 1/3W = 0, the equation further simplifies to:

(3/10)A

Now, we can substitute the value of A:

(3/10) * $10 = $3

The final answer is: $3"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20.

The total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
4s + 2g = 70

We also know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write another equation:
s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' by substituting the value of 'g' from the second equation into the first equation.

Rearranging the second equation to isolate 'g', we get:
g = 20 - s

Substituting this expression for 'g' into the first equation, we get:
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
2s + 40 = 70
2s = 30
s = 15

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut purchase, we need to consider the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. Since the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand, we can calculate the cost per pound as follows:

Cost of normal brand = $5 per pound
Increase in cost = 20% of $5 = 0.20 x $5 = $1
Cost of more expensive brand = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Since Roger buys 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the more expensive brand is:

7 pounds x $6 per pound = $42

Adding the cost of the donut, which is $2, we get:

$42 + $2 = $44

Therefore, the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut purchase is $44.

Final answer: $44"
"To determine the cost of the apple pie, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Gus purchased and subtract that from the total amount he spent.

Gus spent $20.00 in total. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, calculate the total cost of the chips: 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
Next, calculate the total cost of the chicken and soda: $8.00 + $1.00 = $9.00
Now, add the cost of the chips and the chicken and soda: $4.00 + $9.00 = $13.00

To find the cost of the apple pie, subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"To determine the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we can use a simple subtraction method. 

Let's break it down:

Total newspapers delivered = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we subtract the sum of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total:

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers delivered - (Newspapers delivered to District A + Newspapers delivered to District C)
= 600 - (198 + 209)
= 600 - 407
= 193

The final answer is: $\boxed{193}$"
"To calculate the total number of recipes John learns, we need to determine the total number of hours he spends in the class and then divide that by the number of hours required to learn a new recipe.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so the total number of hours per week is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. Since the class meets for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find the number of recipes he learns, we can divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

48 ÷ 1.5 = 32

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes."
"To determine the number of math teachers, we can calculate the percentage of teachers that are not history teachers.

Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
= 150 - (0.6 * 150)
= 150 - 90
= 60

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
60 * 6
= 360 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{360}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Aurelia has $120. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

Kassidy's amount = (3/4) * Aurelia's amount
= (3/4) * 120
= 90

Now, we know Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 60
= 90 + 60
= 150

The total amount of money they have is the sum of their individual amounts:

Total amount = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount
= 120 + 90 + 150
= 360

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

Shared amount = Total amount / 3
= 360 / 3
= 120

Therefore, each person would have $120.

Final answer: $120"
"As a sports enthusiast and basketball aficionado, I can break down the game duration into its components. The game consists of 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. To find the total length of the game, we need to add the time for the 4 regular quarters and the 5-minute extension.

Total game time = (4 quarters * 12 minutes per quarter) + 5 minutes
Total game time = (4 * 12) + 5
Total game time = 48 + 5
Total game time = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"To determine the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 20% of 20% of the total employees.

First, find 20% of 50 employees:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, find 30% of the 10 employees who are management:
30% of 10 = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"

The cost of 7 candies of type A is 7 x $0.5 = $3.50.
The cost of 10 candies of type B is 10 x $0.75 = $7.50.

The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.

Since Adam paid the cashier $15, the change he received is $15 - $11 = $4.

The final answer is $4."
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we can analyze the given information. Christina's mood records show that the first eight days were good, the second eight days were bad, and the third eight days were neutral. This pattern suggests a repeating cycle of 8 days, with 4 days being good and 4 days being bad.

Given that the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can calculate the number of good days left in the month as follows:

Total good days = 12 (initial good days) + 3 (new good days) = 15

Since the cycle repeats every 8 days, we can divide the total good days by 8 to find the number of complete cycles:

15 ÷ 8 = 1 with a remainder of 7

This means that there is 1 complete cycle of 8 good days, and 7 additional good days.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 7.

The final answer is 7."
"Let's dive into the world of algebra to solve this problem. We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, we can represent the number of books Sally has as 'x'. This situation can be modeled by the equation:

2x + 3 = 21

To isolate 'x', we'll start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for 'x':

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

The final answer is: 9"
"To solve this problem, we need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches. 

To do this, we subtract the current height from the target height: 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we divide the remaining height by the growth rate: 360 / 30 = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

Final answer: $\boxed{12}$"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we can break down the problem into steps.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, which means each dog needs 1 toy. With 8 more dogs in the shelter, the total number of dogs becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys.

However, when James returned, he found that 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those toys. This means he needs 12 - 3 = 9 toys.

Since James initially had 4 toys, he needs to buy 9 - 4 = 5 more toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 9 (initially needed) + 5 (additional needed) = 14 toys.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the amount Skyler invested, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find out how much Dylan invested. Since Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, we multiply 1200 by 2/5:

1200 * (2/5) = 480

Now, we subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount to find the remaining amount:

1200 - 480 = 720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. We multiply 720 by 2/3:

720 * (2/3) = 480

Now, we subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount to find Skyler's investment:

720 - 480 = 240

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

The final answer is: $240"
"To determine the number of signatures the sisters need to collect, we can calculate the difference between their goal and the total number of signatures they already have.

Let's denote the number of signatures Carol has as C and the number of signatures Jennifer has as J. We know that C = 20 and J = 44. The total number of signatures they want to collect is 100. 

The number of signatures they need to collect can be calculated as follows:

Total signatures needed = Total desired signatures - Total signatures already collected
Total signatures needed = 100 - (C + J)
Total signatures needed = 100 - (20 + 44)
Total signatures needed = 100 - 64
Total signatures needed = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal."
"To calculate Karen's earnings, we need to first find out how much she earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:
$10 * 2 = $20 per hour

Next, we need to find out how much Karen earns in 3 hours per day. To do this, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day:
$20 * 3 = $60 per day

Since Karen works for 2 days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:
$60 * 2 = $120

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we can use a simple ratio. 

Since 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion to find the number of hash browns for 96 potatoes.

Let's use the following proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6x = 36 * 96
6x = 3456
x = 3456 / 6
x = 576

Therefore, 96 potatoes can be used to make 576 hash browns.

The correct answer is: 576"
"To determine the excess weight of the 9 adults in the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the group and compare it to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Since there are 9 adults, the total weight can be calculated as follows:

Total weight = 9 x 80 kg
Total weight = 720 kg

The maximum load capacity of the elevator is 700 kg. To find the excess weight, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg
Excess weight = 20 kg

The elevator's maximum load capacity has been exceeded by 20 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the total number of cookies, we can use the given information to set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of cookies each person has as follows:

- K = Katarina's cookies
- M = Max's cookies
- C = Cookie Monster's cookies
- S = Summer's cookies

From the problem statement, we know:
1. K = M - 5
2. M = C + 12
3. S = M + 23

We are also given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can substitute this value into equation 1:
68 = M - 5

Now, we can solve for M:
M = 68 + 5
M = 73

Next, we can substitute the value of M into equation 2 to find the Cookie Monster's cookies:
C = M - 12
C = 73 - 12
C = 61

Finally, we can substitute the value of M into equation 3 to find Summer's cookies:
S = M + 23
S = 73 + 23
S = 96

Now, we can find the total number of cookies by adding up the number of cookies each person has:
Total cookies = K + M + C + S
Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
Total cookies = 298

The final answer is: $\boxed{298}$"
"To find the original length of the dress, we can use algebraic manipulation. Let's denote the original length as x. 

The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, so the new length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

Then, 20cm is added to the bottom of the dress. The final length of the dress is 140cm, so we can set up the equation:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5:

x = 80

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80cm."
"To determine the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn, we can use the concept of average speed. Since Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can calculate the average time as follows:

Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode = 60 minutes
Time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode = 40 minutes

Average time = (Time taken in ""turtle"" mode + Time taken in ""rabbit"" mode) / 2
Average time = (60 + 40) / 2
Average time = 100 / 2
Average time = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to calculate the remaining time available.

The total time available is 30 minutes. They have already spent 6 minutes walking to the corner and 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

Time spent so far = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Time left = Total time available - Time spent so far
Time left = 30 minutes - 19 minutes
Time left = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To calculate the total cost of Catherine's grocery items, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Cost per kilo of apples) + (Cost per kilo of bananas) + (Cost per kilo of oranges)

Given:
- Cost per kilo of apples = $4
- Cost per kilo of bananas = $2
- Cost per kilo of oranges = $3

"As a baking expert, I can confidently calculate the number of cookies left in the box. 

To find the total number of cookies baked, we need to calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes, which is twice the number of cookies Greta bakes. 

Greta bakes 30 cookies, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.

The total number of cookies baked is 30 (Greta) + 60 (Celinda) = 90 cookies.

The pair eats 10 cookies, so the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"Let's tackle this problem with a clear and logical approach.

We have two sets of siblings: one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. We can represent the age of the younger triplet as x. Then, the age of the older triplet is x + 7, and the age of the older twin is x + 7 + 7 = x + 14.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets can be expressed as:

x + (x + 7) + (x + 7 + 7) = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 21 = 44

Subtract 21 from both sides:

3x = 23

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 7.67

Since x represents the age of the younger triplet, the age of the older triplet is x + 7 = 7.67 + 7 = 14.67.

The age of the older twin is x + 14 = 7.67 + 14 = 21.67.

However, since we are dealing with whole numbers, we can round down the age of the younger triplet to 7 and the age of the older triplet to 14, as the fractional part doesn't make sense in this context.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To determine the time John has available for a nap, we need to calculate the total time he has before dinner. 

First, we convert 3 hours into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time for all his homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes (available time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To calculate the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to consider the individual costs of each item. 

The cost of one lollipop is $0.40, so the cost of 10 lollipops is 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

The cost of one candy is $3.20, so the cost of 10 candies is 10 * $3.20 = $32.00.

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies: $4.00 + $32.00 = $36.00.

The total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $36.00."
"To calculate the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years, we need to consider their monthly savings and the number of months in a year.

Rong saves 20 coins per month, and Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong. This means Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

The total number of months in 10 years is 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Total coins Rong saves in 120 months = 20 * 120 = 2400 coins
Total coins Neil saves in 120 months = 28 * 120 = 3360 coins

Total coins Rong and Neil have after 10 years = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins

The final answer is: $\boxed{5760}$"

The final answer is: $58.33"
"As a fruit pricing expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the costs involved in creating a crate of fresh fruit.

To calculate the total cost of the crate, we need to consider the individual costs of each type of fruit. The cost of one banana is twice the cost of one apple, so the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.
The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana, so the cost of one orange is 3 * $1 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the crate:
- 5 bananas: 5 * $1 = $5
- 12 apples: 12 * $0.5 = $6
- 7 oranges: 7 * $3 = $21

Total cost of the crate: $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

The final answer is: $32"
"To determine the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color and add them together.

Let's denote the number of red squares as R, blue squares as B, green squares as G, and white squares as W. We are given the following information:

R = 14
B = R + 4
G = B + 6
W = G - 12

We can substitute the expressions for B and G into the equation for W:
W = (R + 4) + 6 - 12
W = R - 2

Now, we can substitute the value of R into the equation for W:
W = 14 - 2
W = 12

Now that we have the number of each color, we can calculate the total area:
Total area = R + B + G + W
Total area = 14 + (14 + 4) + (14 + 4 + 6) + 12
Total area = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
Total area = 68

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{68}$"
"To determine the number of chairs Mia needs to get, we need to calculate the total number of chairs required for the event. 

There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. Since the number of regular chairs is 5 times the number of high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs can be calculated as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
= 5 * 8
= 40

Total number of chairs needed = Number of high chairs + Number of regular chairs
= 8 + 40
= 48

Since Mia already has 8 high chairs, she needs 48 - 8 = 40 more chairs.

The final answer is 40."
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we can use the concept of percentages. Since 20% of the bucks are 8 points, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as follows:

Number of 8-point bucks = Total number of bucks * 0.2
= 25 * 0.2
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.

Final Answer: The final answer is 5."
"To determine the total points the class is missing, we need to calculate the points for each student and then subtract the total from the minimum threshold.

Adam has 50 points.

Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. 
30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. 
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up the points for all students: 
Adam + Betty + Marta + Tom = 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points. 
The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is 145 points short of the minimum threshold to go on the trip."
"To determine the total number of great grand-babies, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since each of Great Grandma Jones' children has three children, and each of those children has three babies of their own, we can represent this as a geometric progression.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children, so the total number of grandchildren is 3 x 3 = 9.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the total number of great grand-babies is 9 x 3 = 27.

Therefore, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

Final Answer: The final answer is 27."
"To calculate Greta's remaining funds, we need to determine the amount she sets aside for her retirement account and car payment, then subtract these amounts from her original paycheck.

Greta's original paycheck is $2400. 

1. Retirement account: 50% of $2400 = $1200
2. Car payment: 20% of $2400 = $480

Now, let's subtract the amounts from her original paycheck:

$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $720

Greta has $720 left to spend."
"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we need to first find the total number of pencils. Since there are 20 spaces for pencils and 4 are missing, the total number of pencils is 20 - 4 = 16.

Since a pair of pencils consists of 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2 to find the number of pairs.

16 / 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the fireworks in the city and the fireworks in her backyard.

First, let's calculate the number of fireworks in the city. Since Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks, we can calculate 40% of the total number of fireworks in the city. The city has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.

To find 40% of 300, we can multiply 300 by 0.4:

300 * 0.4 = 120

Now, let's calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard. She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, so the total number of fireworks in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the number of fireworks in the city and the number of fireworks in her backyard:

120 (city) + 15 (backyard) = 135

The final answer is: $\boxed{135}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks, we need to consider the number of people, drinks, and snacks.

There are 19 people in total, including Aiden and his 12 friends, and the 7 additional friends who join them. Each person consumes 2 drinks and 3 snacks.

The total number of drinks is 19 * 2 = 38 drinks.
The total number of snacks is 19 * 3 = 57 snacks.

Since each drink and snack costs $2, the total cost of drinks is 38 * 2 = $76.
The total cost of snacks is 57 * 2 = $114.

The total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is $76 + $114 = $190.

The final answer is: $190"
"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we can start by finding the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Since Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, Gordy's truck can carry 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

The total capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds. To find the capacity of Gary's truck, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity: 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2800}$"
"To determine the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry, we can use the information provided. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and each male ate 1 more than each female, we can express the number of dumplings eaten by each male as 3 + 1 = 4.

Let's denote the number of dumplings eaten by each female as F and the number of dumplings eaten by each male as M. We know that F = 3 and M = F + 1.

The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8M, and the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6F. Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by males and females.

We can set up the equation: 8M + 6F = Total dumplings

Substituting M = F + 1, we get: 8(F + 1) + 6F = Total dumplings
Expanding the equation: 8F + 8 + 6F = Total dumplings
Combine like terms: 14F + 8 = Total dumplings

We know that F = 3, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 14(3) + 8 = Total dumplings
Simplifying the equation: 42 + 8 = Total dumplings
Evaluating the expression: 50 = Total dumplings

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is 50.

Final answer: 50"
"To find out how much money Gerald had left, we need to first find out how much he had initially. 

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5.

Gerald spent $10, so he had 60 - 10 = 50 left.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to calculate the turtle's speed and then multiply it by the given time.

Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we can find the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time.

Distance = Turtle's speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$"
"To determine the number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise, we can divide the remaining amount they need to raise ($6300 - $2100 = $4200) by the amount they raise per hour.

"As a hydrologist specializing in water resource management, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the percentage of the Colorado River's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Given that Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes as follows:

Let's denote the total water used by the city as 0.4 (40%) and the percentage of water used for industrial purposes as 0.8 (80%). To find the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from 1 (or 100%):

Non-industrial water usage = 1 - 0.8
Non-industrial water usage = 0.2 or 20%

Therefore, 20% of the Colorado River's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final answer: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we can multiply the number of days in 2 weeks by her daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks would be 2 x 7 = 14 days.

Since Alex charges $12 per day, the total amount she charges for 2 weeks would be:

14 days x $12 per day = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

The final answer is: $168"
"To determine the total number of quarts made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the rate of production for each type of ice cream and then add them together.

The chocolate ice cream factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so its rate is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.

The vanilla ice cream factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so its rate is 50/4 = 12.5 quarts per hour.

Now, we can calculate the total number of quarts made in 48 hours:

Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts

Total quarts made in 48 hours: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts

The final answer is: $\boxed{3000}$"
"As a pastry expert, I can calculate the total bill with precision. To find the total cost of each item and apply the 10% discount, I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item:

- 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece: 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
- 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each: 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
- 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each: 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
- 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each: 13 x $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

To apply the 10% discount, I'll calculate 10% of the total cost: $50.00 x 0.10 = $5.00

Finally, I'll subtract the discount from the total cost: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The total bill is $45.00."
"To determine the optimal number of scoops Erin should buy, we can apply the concept of fractional parts to the deal. Since the deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free,"" we can consider it as a 3:1 ratio. 

In this case, Erin can buy 2 scoops for the price of 3 scoops. Given that each scoop costs $1.50, we can calculate the total cost of 3 scoops:

3 scoops × $1.50/scoop = $4.50

Since Erin has $6.00, she can afford to buy 3 scoops. 

Final answer: 3"
"To determine how much candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total number of days in two weeks, which is 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day, so in 14 days, she eats 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Initially, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy each. After two weeks, Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy, and Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy.

To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: 58 - 44 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the number of mosaic tiles needed to cover two thirds of a 36 square foot bathroom, we can use the following calculation:

(2/3) * 36 = 24 square feet

Since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles per square foot, we multiply 24 by 24:

24 * 24 = 576

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

576"
"The art of blueberry picking! As a blueberry enthusiast, I'm delighted to crunch the numbers for you.

To determine James' savings, we need to calculate the cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.

The cost of picking blueberries can be calculated as follows:

Initial cost: $20
Additional cost per pound: $1.5
Total pounds picked: 30

Total cost of picking blueberries = Initial cost + (Additional cost per pound * Total pounds picked)
= $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
= $20 + $45
= $65

Now, let's compare this to the cost of buying blueberries at the store:

Cost of buying blueberries at the store: $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds
= $2.5 * 30
= $75

To find the savings, we subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying: $75 - $65
= $10

Therefore, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself.

The final answer is: $10"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid for the computers, we need to consider the increased price of each computer. 

The original price of each computer was $700. Since the price increased by 10%, we can calculate the new price as follows:

New price = Original price + (Original price * 0.10)
= $700 + ($700 * 0.10)
= $700 + $70
= $770

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money the company paid by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers:

Total amount = New price * Number of computers
= $770 * 500
= $385,000

The final answer is: $385,000"
"To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we can break it down into its components.

The omelet consists of 6 eggs, cheese, and ham. We know the calorie content of each component: eggs (75 calories each), cheese (120 calories per ounce), and ham (40 calories per ounce). Since the problem states that John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, we can assume he uses 2 ounces of each.

Eggs: 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories
Cheese: 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories
Ham: 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

The omelet has 770 calories."

"As a civil engineer specializing in pavement maintenance, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

To determine the cost-effectiveness of Ron's decision, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the fine and the cost of the asphalt.

The cost of fixing the pothole is the sum of the damage to the car ($450) and the cost of the fine ($120), plus the cost of the asphalt (3 buckets at $25 each, which is $75). This gives us a total cost of $645.

On the other hand, if Ron doesn't fix the pothole, he will incur the cost of the fine ($120) and the damage to his car ($450), totaling $570.

By fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves $570 (total cost of not fixing the pothole) - $645 (total cost of fixing the pothole) = -$75. However, since we are looking for the amount of money saved, we take the absolute value of the result, which is $75.

The correct answer is $75."

"To calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we can use the formula for average:

Average time = (Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog) / 2

Given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, and the dog takes 2/3 of that time, we can calculate the dog's time as follows:

Time taken by dog = 2/3 * 30 minutes
= 20 minutes

Now, we can find the average time:

Average time = (30 + 20) / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as 'x'. We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

9x + 10 = length of Topher's shoe

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. To convert this to inches, we multiply the feet by 12 and add the inches: 8 feet * 12 inches/foot + 4 inches = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Now we can set up the equation:

9x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

9x = 90

Divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

"As a textile expert, I can confidently calculate the percentage of blue spools in Candy's collection.

To find the total number of blue spools, we need to add the number of light blue and dark blue spools. 

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60

Now, we need to find the total number of spools. 

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150

To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100.

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue."
"To determine the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we can break down the problem into steps.

First, we need to find the number of people who voted by midday. Since 2/5 of the 5000 people voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/5) * 5000 = 2000

This means 2000 people voted by midday. To find the number of people remaining, we subtract this from the total number of people:

5000 - 2000 = 3000

Next, we need to find the number of people who voted by 16:00. Since 2/3 of the remaining people voted, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 3000 = 2000

This means 2000 more people voted by 16:00. To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the total number of people who voted from the total number of people:

5000 - (2000 + 2000) = 5000 - 4000 = 1000

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.

"To determine the number of packs of gum Parker will need, we can use the following calculation:

Number of packs = Total number of days / Number of pieces of gum per day

Let's plug in the values:

Number of packs = 30 days / 4 pieces of gum per day

Number of packs = 30 / 4

Number of packs = 7.5

Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Parker has enough gum for the entire 30 days.

Number of packs = 8

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we can calculate the total number of smores required and then divide it by the number of smores per box.

First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed:
9 kids * 2 smores/kid = 18 smores
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 smores
Total smores needed = 18 + 6 = 24 smores

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, and each sleeve makes 8 smores, we can calculate the total number of smores per box:
3 sleeves/sleeve * 8 smores/sleeve = 24 smores/box

Now, we can divide the total number of smores needed by the number of smores per box to find the number of boxes required:
24 smores/box ÷ 24 smores/box = 1 box

However, since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 2 boxes of graham crackers.

Final answer: $\boxed{2}$"
"To calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we can start by finding her father's age. Since Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as an equation:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
= 2 * 15 + 8
= 38 years

Next, we can find Dora's mother's age by subtracting 4 years from her father's age:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
= 38 - 4
= 34 years

Now, we can calculate the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

Combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age

- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: weighs twice as much as the English book, so 2 x 3 = 6 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The total weight of Cindy's books is 17 pounds."
"In a student council election, candidate A received 20% of the votes, while candidate B secured 50% more votes than candidate A. To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we can calculate the votes for candidate B first.

Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.2 * 100 = 20 votes.

Candidate B's votes = 20 + 50% of 20 = 20 + 0.5 * 20 = 30 votes.

Since the total number of votes is 100, we can find candidate C's votes by subtracting the votes of candidates A and B from the total.

Candidate C's votes = 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 votes.

The final answer is 50."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Boris initially has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. This means Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck's new amount becomes 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after the exchange. To do this, we subtract Beck's current amount from Boris's current amount: 90 - 87 = 3.

The final answer is 3."

32 - 30 = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 2."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of books each person has.

Let's denote the number of books Steven has as 'S' and the number of books Alice has as 'A'. We know that Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so we can write an equation: 
C = 2S

We are also given that Clara has 20 books, so we can substitute 20 for C: 
20 = 2S

To find the value of S, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know Steven has 10 books, we can find the number of books Alice has by adding 6 to Steven's total: 
A = S + 6
A = 10 + 6
A = 16

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of books Clara and Alice have by subtracting Alice's total from Clara's total: 
Difference = C - A
Difference = 20 - 16
Difference = 4

The final answer is 4."
"Let's dive into the world of dairy pricing. As a milk connoisseur, I can assure you that understanding the cost of different container sizes is crucial for making informed purchasing decisions.

To find the cost of a half-gallon jar, we need to subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 * $5
Cost of 10-gallon jars = $50

Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $48

"To determine the number of students who like to play video games, we can use the information provided. We know that the total number of students is 50, and 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or music.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as x. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of students: 10 (bake) + 5 (basketball) + x (video games) + 10 (music) = 50.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 + 5 + x + 10 = 50

Combine like terms: 25 + x = 50

Subtract 25 from both sides: x = 25

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

"To determine the total number of birds in the backyard, we need to consider the initial number of birds and the number of birds that were scared away.

Initially, there were 12 birds in the backyard. Since 1/3 of the birds were scared away, we can calculate the number of birds that were scared away as follows:

Number of birds scared away = 1/3 × 12
= 12/3
= 4

Now, we subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number of birds to find the number of birds remaining:

Number of birds remaining = Initial number of birds - Number of birds scared away
= 12 - 4
= 8

Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. To find the total number of birds now, we add the number of birds that joined to the number of birds remaining:

Total number of birds now = Number of birds remaining + Number of birds that joined
= 8 + 20
= 28

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the total number of students in each class as x. Since there are 80 students in total and 2 classes with the same number of students, we can set up the equation:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 40

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we can multiply 40 by 0.4 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

Number of girls in each class = 40 * 0.4
= 16

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

Number of boys in each class = x - 16
= 40 - 16
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class.

"To calculate the daily savings, we need to find the difference in cost between the old vendor and the new vendor.

The old vendor charges $0.5 per tomato, while the new vendor charges $0.4 per tomato. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.

Since the vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, the daily savings can be calculated as:

Daily savings = (Cost per tomato) * (Number of tomatoes sold per day)
= $0.1 * 500
= $50

To find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7:

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
= $50 * 7
= $350

The vendor saves $350 per week."
"Let's dive into the world of marble collections. As a marble enthusiast, I can tell you that the key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Initially, Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. 
90% of 30 small stickers is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 
She has 20 large stickers left, so she trades 20 large stickers for 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

"In the context of council voting dynamics, understanding the relationship between votes in favor and against is crucial. When the vote passes with twice as many votes in favor as there are against, it indicates a significant level of support. Given that the total number of council members is 33, we can model this situation using a simple equation.

Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against, the number of votes in favor can be represented as 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against, which must equal 33. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

x = 11

Now that we know the number of votes against, we can calculate the number of votes in favor by multiplying x by 2:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, we can break down the information as follows:

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the first house as x. Since the second house needs half of the total, it will need 250 * 1/2 = 125 cases. The third house needs double the amount of the first house, so it will need 2x cases.

We know that the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 125 + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3x + 125 = 250

Subtract 125 from both sides:

3x = 125

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 41.67

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to express the answer as a decimal, as it represents a fraction of a case.

The third house needs 2x cases, which is 2 * 41.67 = 83.33 cases.

"To determine the number of pencils Anthony kept, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

Anthony initially had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, which is equivalent to 25 pencils. This leaves him with 50 - 25 = 25 pencils.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. To find 3/5 of 25, we can multiply 25 by 3 and divide by 5:

(3/5) × 25 = (3 × 25) / 5
= 75 / 5
= 15

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. To find the number of pencils he kept, we subtract 15 from the remaining pencils:

25 - 15 = 10

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

"To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes to drive to the museum and the time spent at the museum.

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a constant speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
Time = 2 hours

Since Jack drives back home, we need to double the time:
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 2 hours * 2
Total time to drive to and from the museum = 4 hours

Adding the time spent at the museum:
Total time gone from home = Total time to drive to and from the museum + Time spent at the museum
Total time gone from home = 4 hours + 6 hours
Total time gone from home = 10 hours

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$"
"To determine the number of wheels left in the box, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for the toys and subtract it from the total number of wheels available.

The number of wheels required for the cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels.
The number of wheels required for the motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Total number of wheels required = 228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels.

Now, let's subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box: 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels.

The number of wheels left in the box is 276."
"To calculate the discounted price of the laptop, we need to find 20% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The formula for finding the discount amount is: Discount = (Discount Percentage * Original Price) / 100

In this case, the discount percentage is 20% and the original price is $1000.

Discount = (20 * $1000) / 100
Discount = $200

Now, subtract the discount from the original price:

Discounted Price = Original Price - Discount
Discounted Price = $1000 - $200
Discounted Price = $800

Therefore, the discounted price of the laptop is $800."
"To calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we need to find the number of movies in series. Since a third of the movies are in series, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of movies in series = Total number of movies / 3
Number of movies in series = 600 / 3
Number of movies in series = 200

Since Mike can get the series for $6 of the cost of a normal movie, we need to find the cost of the series:

Cost of series = Number of movies in series * $6
Cost of series = 200 * $6
Cost of series = $1200

Next, we need to find the number of remaining movies that are not in series. We can do this by subtracting the number of movies in series from the total number of movies:

Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies in series
Number of remaining movies = 600 - 200
Number of remaining movies = 400

Since 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, we can calculate the number of older movies as follows:

Number of older movies = Number of remaining movies * 0.4
Number of older movies = 400 * 0.4
Number of older movies = 160

The cost of the older movies is $5 each, so we can calculate the total cost of the older movies:

Cost of older movies = Number of older movies * $5
Cost of older movies = 160 * $5
Cost of older movies = $800

Now, we need to find the cost of the normal movies. Since there are 400 remaining movies and 160 of them are older movies, the number of normal movies is:

Number of normal movies = Number of remaining movies - Number of older movies
Number of normal movies = 400 - 160
Number of normal movies = 240

Cost of normal movies = Number of normal movies * $10
Cost of normal movies = 240 * $10
Cost of normal movies = $2400

Finally, we can find the total cost of replacing the movies by adding the cost of the series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the normal movies:

Total cost = Cost of series + Cost of older movies + Cost of normal movies
Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400
Total cost = $4400

The final answer is: $4400"
"To calculate the total cost of the fruit, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Cost per pound of peaches * pounds of peaches) + (Cost per pound of plums * pounds of plums) + (Cost per pound of apricots * pounds of apricots)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total Cost = ($2.00 * 6) + ($1.00 * 8) + ($3.00 * 6)
Total Cost = $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00
Total Cost = $38.00

The final answer is: $38.00"
"To determine the distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot, we can use the formula for distance, which is the product of speed and time. 

Given that they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and hiked at an average speed of 20 miles per hour (which is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed), we can calculate the distance they covered while hiking.

Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours
Hiking speed = 20 miles per hour

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 20 * 1.5
Distance = 30 miles

Therefore, the distance to their vacation spot is 30 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we need to calculate their individual scores based on the given information.

Let's denote Emma's score as E and Ava's score as A.

Emma's score can be calculated as follows:
- She collects 3 more berries than Ava, so she collects 3 + 5 = 8 berries.
- She jumps on 8 fewer enemies than Ava, so she jumps on 8 - 8 = 0 enemies.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava, so she finishes the level in 30 - 4 = 26 seconds.

Emma's score: 0 * 10 (for enemies) + 8 * 5 (for berries) + 26 * 30 (for time) = 0 + 40 + 780 = 820

Ava's score can be calculated as follows:
- She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on 8 * 10 = 80 enemies.
- She collects 5 fewer berries than Emma, so she collects 8 - 5 = 3 berries.
- She finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she finishes the level in 26 + 4 = 30 seconds.

Ava's score: 80 * 10 (for enemies) + 3 * 5 (for berries) + 30 * 30 (for time) = 800 + 15 + 900 = 1715

The difference between their scores is A - E = 1715 - 820 = 895.

The final answer is: $\boxed{895}$"
"To determine the cost of the other two pizzas, we can use the following steps:

Let's denote the cost of each of the other two pizzas as x. Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars and two of them cost 30 dollars, we can set up the equation:

2x + 30 = 64

Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 34

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 17

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

The final answer is: $17"
"To calculate the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to consider the number of times they ride on usual days and the extra days.

On usual days, they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, which can be calculated as 3 * 5 = 15. 

On the other 2 days, they ride twice the usual amount, so we multiply 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.

Now, we add the total number of times they ride on both types of days: 15 + 12 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is 27.

The final answer is 27."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2x

where x is the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = -11/2

x = -5.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, this solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. However, we can try to find a whole number solution.

Let's re-evaluate the situation: Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish initially. He took out 14 orange fish and 3 white fish. Now, he has 3 - 14 = -11 orange fish and 4 - 3 = 1 white fish.

Since Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, we can set up the equation:

-11 = 2x

where x is the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.

To solve for x, we can try different whole number values of x. Let's try x = 6:

"As a fuel efficiency expert, I'd be happy to help you calculate the weekly fuel consumption of Andy's car.

To determine the total distance traveled in a week, we need to consider the one-way distance between Andy's home and office, which is 5 miles. Since he travels to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance traveled in a week is:

Total distance = 5 miles/day * 5 days = 25 miles

Now, we can calculate the amount of gas consumed per week using Andy's fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon:

Gas consumed per week = Total distance / Fuel efficiency
= 25 miles / 10 MPG
= 2.5 gallons

To find the cost of gas consumed per week, we multiply the gas consumed per week by the current price of regular gas, which is $3 per gallon:

Cost of gas consumed per week = Gas consumed per week * Price per gallon
= 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon
= $7.50

The final answer is: $7.50"
"To calculate the total amount Carrie paid for lunch, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the amount she spent on twenties and the amount she spent on quarters.

Carrie had 10 twenties, and she spent 3/5 of them. This can be calculated as (3/5) * 10 = 6 twenties. Since each twenty is worth 20 dollars, the total amount she spent on twenties is 6 * 20 = 120 dollars.

She also spent all 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total amount she spent on quarters is 140 * 0.25 = 35 dollars.

The total amount she spent is the sum of the amount spent on twenties and the amount spent on quarters: 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.

"As a botanist specializing in horticulture, I can provide a detailed analysis of Ricardo's garden.

To calculate the total number of fruits, we need to consider the yield of each plant type. Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, each yielding 22 tomatoes, and 8 eggplant plants, each yielding 4 eggplants.

Total tomatoes = 5 plants * 22 tomatoes/plant = 110 tomatoes
Total eggplants = 8 plants * 4 eggplants/plant = 32 eggplants

The total number of fruits in Ricardo's garden is the sum of the total tomatoes and eggplants: 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.

"As an expert in sales analysis, I can break down the problem into its components to determine the number of OLED TVs sold.

Let's start by finding the total number of non-OLED TVs sold. Since one-fourth of the TVs are smart TVs, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 TVs, and one-eighth of the TVs are analog TVs, which is 1/8 * 40 = 5 TVs, we can add these numbers together to get the total number of non-OLED TVs sold: 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.

To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the total number of non-OLED TVs sold from the total number of TVs sold: 40 - 15 = 25 TVs.

"To determine the number of logs Carson needs to burn, we must consider the temperature difference between the day and night, as well as the heating capacity of each log. 

The temperature difference is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. Since each log heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can calculate the required number of logs as follows:

Number of logs = Temperature difference / Heating capacity per log
= 12 / 5
= 2.4

Since we can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the house is warm enough. Therefore, Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Final answer: 3"
"To determine the total number of seashells collected, we need to calculate the number of groups that had members bring back seashells and multiply it by the number of seashells each group brought.

Since 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
= 90 / 9
= 10

Now, we can find the number of groups that had members bring back seashells:

Number of groups with seashells = 3/5 * Number of groups
= 3/5 * 10
= 6

Each group had 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups with seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

Total seashells = Number of groups with seashells * Number of seashells per group
= 6 * 2
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of people on the train, we can follow the sequence of events:

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so the number of people left is 172 - 47 = 125. Then, 13 more people get on, so the number of people on the train is now 125 + 13 = 138. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so the number of people left is 138 - 38 = 100.

Therefore, there are 100 people on the train.

Final Answer: The final answer is 100."
"As a financial analyst specializing in micro-economics, I can provide a detailed calculation to determine Damien's monthly earnings.

Let's break it down:

Number of bottle caps per day: 10
Number of days in the month: 30
Value of each bottle cap: $0.25

Total number of bottle caps in 30 days: 10 * 30 = 300
Total amount of money: 300 * $0.25 = $75

Therefore, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month.

Final Answer: The final answer is $75."
"To calculate Jamie's total earnings for the day, we need to consider her regular and special hourly rates.

Her regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. For 8 hours, she earns:
8 hours * $20/hour = $160

For the additional 3 hours, her special hourly rate is 150% of $20, which is:
$20 * 1.5 = $30 per hour
3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Total earnings for the day:
$160 + $90 = $250

"As a zookeeper with extensive experience in animal behavior and enclosure management, I can confidently calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure.

To determine the total number of lions, we need to consider the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

Number of male lions = 12 (female lions) / 2 = 6

Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions.

Total number of lions = 12 (female) + 6 (male) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

The final answer is 32."
"To calculate the amount of money Mike will have left over after purchasing the discounted jeans, we need to find 25% of the original price and subtract it from the $50 bill.

The original price of the jeans is $40. To find 25% of $40, we multiply $40 by 0.25.

$40 x 0.25 = $10

Now, we subtract the discounted price from the $50 bill:

$50 - $10 = $40

Since the question asks for the amount of money Mike will have left over, the correct answer is $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can use the formula for the total salary paid, which is the product of the total number of employees and the salary per employee.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of employees after 3 months:
   - Month 1: 200 + 20 = 220
   - Month 2: 220 + 20 = 240
   - Month 3: 240 + 20 = 260

2. Since the number of employees increases linearly, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the total number of employees after 3 months:
   Total employees = (20 * 3) + 200
   Total employees = 60 + 200
   Total employees = 260

3. Now, we can calculate the total salary paid after 3 months:
   Total salary paid = Total employees * Salary per employee
   Total salary paid = 260 * $4000
   Total salary paid = $1,040,000

The final answer is: $1,040,000"
"As a music enthusiast and a blue-loving individual, I'd be delighted to help you calculate the total caroling time.

To determine the total time, we need to add the time for each song. 

""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so 2 x 150 = 300 seconds.
""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, so 1 x 240 = 240 seconds.

Now, we add the times together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.

They will be caroling for 540 seconds.

Final answer: 540"
"Let's dive into the world of hourly wages and calculate the difference between Billy's and Sally's earnings.

To determine the hourly wage of Billy and Sally, we need to consider the two raises he received. Billy's initial wage was $10 per hour. After the first raise, his wage became $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour. After the second raise, his wage became $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Since Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, her starting wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate their total earnings after working 20 hours. Billy's total earnings will be 20 * $11.50 = $230. Sally's total earnings will be 20 * $10.50 = $210.

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings: $230 - $210 = $20.

The final answer is: $20"
"To calculate the difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels, we can use simple arithmetic.

The cost of 3 loaves of bread is 3 x $2 = $6.
The cost of 2 bagels is 2 x $1 = $2.

To find the difference, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread: $6 - $2 = $4.

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is: $4"
"To find the total score of Pierson and Nikita, we need to calculate Nikita's score first. Since Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, we can calculate Nikita's score as follows:

Pierson's score = 278
Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139
Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150

Now, let's add their scores together:
Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428

The total score of Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider the number of students and teachers participating in the reforestation campaign.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class. This gives us a total of 40 * 25 = 1000 students. Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by students is 1000.

Additionally, there are 40 classes with 3 teachers per class, resulting in a total of 40 * 3 = 120 teachers. As each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.

The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers, which is 1000 + 240 = 1240.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1240}$"
"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently has and set up an equation to find the number of goats that will make up 30% of her total collection.

Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. Let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals:

Total number of stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Since Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals, we can set up the equation:

Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys. The total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + x. We can set up the equation:

(14 + x) / (14 + x) = 0.3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by (14 + x) to get:

14 + x = 0.3(14 + x)

Expanding the right side, we get:

14 + x = 4.2 + 0.3x

Subtracting 14 from both sides gives:

x = 0.3x + 0.2

Subtracting 0.3x from both sides gives:

0.7x = 0.2

Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:

x = 0.2 / 0.7
x = 2/7
x = 0.2857

Since we can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can buy 2 stuffed goats to make the percentage 30% of all her stuffed animals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we can break down her gaming time into two segments: the first 2 weeks and the last week.

Kris plays for 0.5 hours per day for 14 days in the first 2 weeks, which equals 14 * 0.5 = 7 hours. In the last week, she plays for 2 hours per day for 7 days, totaling 7 * 2 = 14 hours.

The total hours played by Kris is 7 + 14 = 21 hours. To earn the achievement, she needs 30 hours. Therefore, Kris needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours more.

The final answer is: 9"
"When two cars are traveling at different speeds on a highway, the distance between them can be determined by considering their relative motion. Since the second car is traveling at a higher speed, it will cover more ground in the same time frame.

Let's denote the speed of the first car as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the speed of the second car as v2 = 70 miles per hour. The time elapsed is given as t = 2 hours.

The distance traveled by the first car is d1 = v1 * t = 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

The distance traveled by the second car is d2 = v2 * t = 70 * 2 = 140 miles.

To find the distance between the two cars, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car: d = d2 - d1 = 140 - 120 = 20 miles.

Therefore, after 2 hours, there will be 20 miles separating the two cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the ring, we need to determine the cost of the premium. The cost of the diamond is $600 and the cost of the gold is $300. The total cost of the ring is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.3.

$900 * 0.3 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the ring.

$900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring.

The final answer is: $1170"
"To calculate the overall pass rate, we need to consider the number of students who passed in each grade and the total number of students in the school.

Let's break it down:

Third-graders who passed: 340
Fourth-graders who passed: 40
Fifth-graders who passed: 2 * 40 = 80

Total students who passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
Total students in the school: 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, we can calculate the overall pass rate:
Overall pass rate = (Total students who passed / Total students in the school) * 100
= (460 / 1000) * 100
= 46%

The overall pass rate is 46%."
"To determine the length of the mosaic, we need to calculate the total area that can be covered with the available glass chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch of the mosaic, we can find the total area by multiplying the number of chips by the number of chips per square inch.

Number of bags: 2
Number of chips per bag: 72
Number of chips per square inch: 12

Total number of chips: 2 * 72 = 144
Total square inches: 144 / 12 = 12

Since Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height.

Area = 12 square inches
Height = 3 inches
Length = Area / Height = 12 / 3 = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that is 4 inches long.

The final answer is: 4"
"To determine the initial amount of tea, we need to calculate the total amount consumed and add it to the amount left.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed. Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts. Additionally, 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.

Total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, the initial amount of tea was 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.

To convert quarts to gallons, we divide by 4 (since 1 gallon = 4 quarts).
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has and subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Dale initially ordered 100 candies and then ordered 100 more, resulting in a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies. Since he sold 150 candies, he now has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left.

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we can subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he wants to sell. However, since he wants to sell all of his candies, we can simply subtract the number of candies he has from the total number of candies he ordered.

Let's denote the total number of candies Dale wants to sell as x. We know that x = 200 (the total number of candies he ordered) and the number of candies he has left is 50. To find the number of candies he still needs to sell, we can set up the equation:

x - 50 = number of candies still needed to sell

Since we know x = 200, we can substitute this value into the equation:

200 - 50 = number of candies still needed to sell
150 = number of candies still needed to sell

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 150 candies to sell all of his candy.

Final Answer: The final answer is 150."
"To calculate the number of additional students who joined the campus by the end of May, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Since the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can model this as an exponential function.

Let's break it down:

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles from 10 to 20.
- At the end of February, the number of students doubles from 20 to 40.
- At the end of March, the number of students doubles from 40 to 80.
- At the end of April, the number of students doubles from 80 to 160.
- At the end of May, the number of students doubles from 160 to 320.

The number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year is 10. To find the additional students, we subtract 10 from 320.

320 - 10 = 310

The final answer is: $\boxed{310}$"
"As a tree climber and arborist, I can provide a precise calculation to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

To find the total number of branches Felix climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25).

Total branches = Total money / Cost per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25
Total branches = 420

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we can divide the total branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

Average branches per day = Total branches / 7
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate the total number of petals in the vase, we need to consider the number of petals from each type of flower and account for the ones dropped.

Let's break it down:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Total petals picked: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

Since Rose dropped 1 of each type, we need to subtract the total number of petals dropped (1 of each type):
- 1 flower with 5 petals: 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals: 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals: 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals: 7 petals

Total petals dropped: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals

Now, subtract the total petals dropped from the total petals picked: 101 - 22 = 79 petals

The total number of petals in the vase is 79."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. They made a total of 18 S'mores (9 each). Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the total number of marshmallows used is 18.

To find the number of marshmallows left, we subtract the number used from the initial amount:

35 (initial marshmallows) - 18 (marshmallows used) = 17

Now, we need to find out how many S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows. Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make is equal to the number of marshmallows left:

Number of S'mores = 17

Since there are two kids, we need to divide the total number of S'mores by 2 to find out how many each kid can have:

Number of S'mores per kid = 17 ÷ 2 = 8.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a S'more, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can provide the exact answer.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the total amount of money used, we need to determine the time each person played and multiply it by the cost per game.

Let's break down the time each person played:

- Jack plays for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 240 minutes. Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he will use 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.
- The friend who is significantly worse plays for half the time, so they play for 120 minutes. This person will use 120 / 20 = 6 quarters.
- The other friend also plays for 120 minutes, so they will use 6 quarters.
- The better friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 1.5 * 240 = 360 minutes. This person will use 360 / 20 = 18 quarters.

Now, let's add up the quarters used by each person: 12 + 6 + 6 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total amount of money used is 42 * $0.25 = $10.50.

The final answer is: $10.50"
"To determine the amount of oil used in the salt scrub, we can analyze the given information. Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x ounces.

Given that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, the amount of oil used is 2x ounces. We also know that the amount of salt used is x ounces.

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, which is the sum of the amounts of salt, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms:

5x = 10

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 2

Now that we know the amount of salt used is 2 ounces, we can find the amount of oil used:

Oil = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 ounces

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"

Therefore, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes to meet the total requirement.

The final answer is: 15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars. This means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find 20% of 40, we can multiply 40 by 0.2 (since 20% is equivalent to 0.2). This gives us 40 * 0.2 = 8 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother. He sold 8 cars, so he gives away 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

To find the number of cars Joe has left, we subtract the number of cars he gave away from the number he had after selling: 32 - 16 = 16 cars.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To determine the amount each student raised, we need to calculate the total amount raised by the students and then divide it by the number of students.

The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Since there are 20 students, we can divide the amount raised by students by the number of students to find the individual contribution:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

The final answer is: $6,250"
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to consider the time she walked on each day.

The time walked on the first day is given as 8 hours. Since the time walked on the second day is half of the first day, we can calculate it as follows:

Time walked on the second day = 8 / 2 = 4 hours

Total time walked in two days = 8 + 4 = 12 hours

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
Total time in minutes = 12 * 60 = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars arrived, making the total number of cars 50 + 20 = 70.

When Hunter got out of class for lunch, 1/2 of the cars had left. To find the number of cars that left, we multiply the total number of cars by 1/2: 1/2 * 70 = 35.

To find the number of cars left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars: 70 - 35 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The final answer is 35."
"As a financial analyst specializing in labor market studies, I can provide a detailed calculation to determine John's weekly earnings.

To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to multiply the number of tasks he completes in a week by the payment per task.

Number of tasks per cycle = 5
Number of cycles per day = 30
Number of days in a week = 7

Total number of tasks per day = 5 * 30 = 150
Total number of tasks in a week = 150 * 7 = 1050

Payment per task = $1.20
Total payment per week = 1050 * $1.20 = $1260

Therefore, John's weekly earnings are $1260.

"To determine Sasha's total points, we need to calculate her points in both games. 

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Now, let's add the points from both games: 
14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.

The total number of tins of cat food can be found by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

Similarly, the total number of tins of dog food can be found by multiplying the number of packages by the number of tins per package: 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

"Let's dive into the world of Magic Card collections. As a card enthusiast, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 Magic Cards. We can represent the number of cards each person has using variables.

Let's say PJ has x cards. Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which equals 341. We can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find the number of cards Becca has:

Becca has 3x + 12 = 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{153}$"
"To determine the total number of eggs Cindy had, we can analyze the given information:

Let's denote the number of green eggs as G, blue eggs as B, pink eggs as P, and yellow eggs as Y.

We know that Cindy had 5 green eggs, so G = 5.

We also know that she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so B = 2G = 2(5) = 10.

Additionally, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so P = B - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9.

Lastly, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so Y = P/3 = 9/3 = 3.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs by adding the number of eggs of each color together:
Total = G + B + P + Y = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.

The final answer is: $\boxed{27}$"
"To calculate the amount Milly will lose, we need to consider the cost of shipping and the refund amount.

The cost of shipping is calculated as follows:
Weight: 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40
Distance: 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60
Total shipping cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, we need to calculate the refund amount:
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32 = $24

To find the amount Milly will lose, we subtract the refund amount from the purchase price and add the shipping cost:
Amount Milly will lose = Purchase price + Shipping cost - Refund amount
= $32 + $3.00 - $24
= $11

The final answer is: $11"
"Let's break down Mulan's expenses step by step.

Mulan starts with $40 and receives $100 from her father, making her total amount $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60. Additionally, she buys a bag for $20. The total cost of the items is $60 + $20 = $80.

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

The final answer is: $60"
"To determine the production for the fourth week, we need to analyze the given information. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars. The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

To find the production for the fourth week, we subtract the total production for the first three weeks from the total monthly production. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Production for the fourth week = Total monthly production - Total production for the first three weeks
= 50,000 - 36,000
= 14,000

The final answer is: $\boxed{14,000}$"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to consider her weekly activities. 

First, let's calculate the time she spends on each activity:

Time spent writing songs: 2 hours/week
Time spent doing makeup: 15 minutes/week * 60 minutes/hour = 0.25 hours/week
Time spent on TikTok (filming, editing, etc.): 18 videos/week * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week * 60 minutes/hour = 4.2 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok per week: 2 hours + 0.25 hours + 4.2 hours = 6.45 hours/week

Total time spent on TikTok in a month: 6.45 hours/week * 4 weeks = 25.8 hours

The final answer is: 25.8"
"As an interior design expert, I can break down the costs for Angela's installation project.

First, let's calculate the cost of the standard items: 
- 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, and 1 chandelier are included in the initial $129.00 package.

Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. To find the cost of the additional items, we need to calculate the number of extra items:
- Mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 extra mirrors
- Chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 extra chandelier
- Pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 extra pictures

The cost of the additional items is:
- 2 extra mirrors * $15.00 = $30.00
- 1 extra chandelier * $15.00 = $15.00
- 10 extra pictures * $15.00 = $150.00

The total cost of the additional items is: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00

The total cost for Angela is: $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00

The final answer is: $324.00"
"To determine Roy's savings, we need to calculate the amount he has saved, which is 40% more than his brother Anthony's savings. 

First, we know that Anthony has $30. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we multiply $30 by 0.4. This gives us $30 * 0.4 = $12.

Now, we add the 40% to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings. $30 + $12 = $42.

The final answer is: $42"
"As a mountain lifting expert, I can analyze the given information to determine the height Naruto can lift.

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift 12 inches.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"To calculate the total distance traveled by Mason, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. 

Mason travels at a constant speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, and then for another 6 hours. 

Distance covered in the first 4 hours = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
Distance covered in the next 6 hours = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance = Distance in the first 4 hours + Distance in the next 6 hours
Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

The final answer is: $\boxed{80}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to first find the speed of the kangaroo. Since 3 kangaroos can travel across the highway in 18 hours, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos.

Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos
Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours

Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we can find the speed of a turtle by dividing the speed of a kangaroo by 2.

Speed of a turtle = Speed of a kangaroo / 2
Speed of a turtle = 6 hours / 2
Speed of a turtle = 3 hours

Now, we can find the time it will take for 4 turtles to travel across the highway by dividing the total distance by the speed of a turtle. However, we don't know the distance. We can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time = Distance / Speed
Since we don't know the distance, we can use the fact that the distance is the same for both the kangaroos and the turtles. We can set up an equation using the time it takes for the kangaroos to travel across the highway.

Time taken by kangaroos = Time taken by turtles
18 hours = 4 * Time taken by a turtle
Time taken by a turtle = 18 hours / 4
Time taken by a turtle = 4.5 hours

Therefore, it will take 4 turtles 4.5 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4.5}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Kora made 20 clay dishes. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, we can represent Rory's dishes as 20 + 20 = 40.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so we can represent Jada's dishes as 2 * 40 = 80.

To find the total number of clay dishes, we add the number of dishes each one made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"To determine the amount of money Erika has in her purse, we need to consider the total amount she has after trading in her old laptop and receiving additional help from her mom.

The original price of the laptop is $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, resulting in a new price of $600 - $200 = $400. Erika has also received $150 for her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as x. We can set up the equation:

x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 230 = 350

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 350 - 230
x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To determine the number of apple slices left, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples separately and then subtract the number of slices Adam ate.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large apples: 3 large apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of slices from the small apples: 5 small apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices.

Now, we add the total number of slices from the large and small apples: 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices.

Finally, we subtract the number of slices Adam ate (15 slices) from the total number of slices: 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices.

The final answer is 15."
"To determine the number of cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can use the following calculation:

Let's denote the number of cows needed as x. Since the farmer currently has 3 cows, each producing 5 liters of milk per day, we can set up the equation:

5x = 25

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 25 / 5
x = 5

This means the farmer needs 5 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final answer: 5"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the length of each glue stick that is not used and add them together.

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it has 5/6 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 5/6 by the original length of 12 mm:
(5/6) * 12 = 10 mm

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it has 1/3 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/3 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/3) * 12 = 4 mm

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it has 1/2 used. To find the length of the used part, we multiply 1/2 by the original length of 12 mm:
(1/2) * 12 = 6 mm

Now, we add the lengths of the used parts together:
10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"To determine how much money Gabriel still needs, we can use simple subtraction. 

First, let's calculate the total amount Gabriel has: $5000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200.

"Let's break down Craig's expenses to determine how much money he has left.

Craig initially has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which equals $40.

He buys 6 squirt guns for $2 each, so the total cost of the squirt guns is 6 x $2 = $12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, so the total cost of the water balloons is 3 x $3 = $9.

The total amount Craig spent is $12 + $9 = $21.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: $40 - $21 = $19.

Craig has $19 left.

The final answer is: $19"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jack collected 60 dishes and has twice as many dishes as socks. To find the number of socks Jack has, we can divide 60 by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 socks

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply 30 by 2 to find the number of socks Peter has:

30 × 2 = 60 socks

Now, we can find the total number of socks they have together:

60 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Peter's socks) = 120 socks

We also know that Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so we can set up an equation to find the number of socks Jack has:

Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as 's'. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, the number of dishes Jack has is 2s. We are given that Jack has 60 dishes, so we can set up the equation:

2s = 60

To solve for 's', we can divide both sides by 2:

s = 60 ÷ 2
s = 30

Now that we know Jack has 30 socks, we can find the number of dishes he has:

Number of dishes = 2s
= 2(30)
= 60

Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, we can find the number of dishes Peter has by dividing 60 by 2:

60 ÷ 2 = 30 dishes

Now, we can find the total number of dishes they have together:

60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 90 dishes

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 120 (socks) + 90 (dishes) = 210.

The final answer is: 210"
"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use a Venn diagram or a simple set theory approach. Let's break it down:

We know that there are 20 students in total. 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. To find the number of students good at both math and English, we subtract the sum of students good at math only and English only from the total number of students.

Number of students good at both math and English = Total number of students - (Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at English only)
= 20 - (5 + 8)
= 20 - 13
= 7

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students good at math only and the number of students good at both math and English.

Total number of students good at math = Number of students good at math only + Number of students good at both math and English
= 5 + 7
= 12

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total available time and subtract the time taken by each group.

The total time of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. We also need to consider the 10-minute intermission. Therefore, the total available time is:

Total available time = 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 130 minutes

The time taken by each group is 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage). To find the number of groups that can perform, we can divide the total available time by the time taken by each group:

Number of groups = Total available time / Time taken by each group
= 130 minutes / 10 minutes
= 13

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is 13.

Final answer: $\boxed{13}$"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + rt)

where:
A = total amount
P = principal amount ($300)
r = annual interest rate (3/4 or 0.75)
t = time in years (3)

First, we need to calculate the interest earned each year:

Year 1: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 2: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225
Year 3: Interest = P * r = $300 * 0.75 = $225

Now, we can calculate the total amount after 3 years:

Year 1: Total = P + Interest = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Total = P + Interest = $525 + $225 = $750
Year 3: Total = P + Interest = $750 + $225 = $975

The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $975."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts. 

First, we know that half of the white shirts have collars. Since there are 40 white shirts, half of them would be 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.

Next, we are given that 20 floral shirts have buttons. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract 20 from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.

Now, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars: 30 (floral shirts with no buttons) - 20 (white shirts with no collars) = 10.

The final answer is 10."
"To determine the total earnings of the farmer, we need to calculate the number of trays he can fill with 900 eggs, given that each tray holds 30 eggs. This can be done by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

Number of trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
= 900 / 30
= 30 trays

Since the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Total earnings = Number of trays * Price per tray
= 30 trays * $2.5 per tray
= $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"To determine the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to calculate the number of goats left in each farm and then add them together.

Let's start by calculating the number of goats left in Farm X. Mr. Smith initially had 55 goats in Farm X and sold 10 goats. To find the number of goats left, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

55 - 10 = 45

Next, we calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y. Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats. To find the number of goats left in Farm Y, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

45 - 20 = 25

Now, let's add the number of goats left in both farms:

45 (Farm X) + 25 (Farm Y) = 70

Therefore, there are 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

= $2640 / 2
= $1320

The average cost of each pair of shoes is $1320."
"To calculate the total cost of the baskets of food, we need to consider the cost of both green and red food. 

First, let's calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
3 * $25 = $75

Next, we'll calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
3 * $18 = $54
Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $6 from the total cost:
$54 - $6 = $48

Now, add the cost of the green food and the discounted cost of the red food:
$75 + $48 = $123

The total cost is $123."
"To determine the time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can use the formula:

Time = (Number of rooms / 2) * Time per room

Given that there are 90 rooms and it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = (90 / 2) * 20
Time = 45 * 20
Time = 900 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

Time = 900 / 60
Time = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

"To calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break it down into three parts.

In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is 3 * 12 = 36 homes.

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built in the first two years, which is 2 * (12 + 36) = 2 * 48 = 96 homes.

Now, let's add the number of homes built in each year: 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.

The town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given the following information:

1. You are 3 years younger than your brother.
2. You are 2 years older than your sister.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.
4. The sum of your ages is 87.

Let's denote your age as 'x'. Then:
- Your brother's age is x + 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 2.
- Your mom's age is 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8.

The sum of your ages is x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87.

Combine like terms: 5x + 9 = 87.

Subtract 9 from both sides: 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since age cannot be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer should be a whole number. Let's re-evaluate the equation.

We can re-express the equation as 5x = 78.

Divide by 5: x = 15.6.

Since x must be a whole number, we can try different values of x to satisfy the equation.

Let's try x = 15: 
- Your age is 15.
- Your brother's age is 15 + 3 = 18.
- Your sister's age is 15 - 2 = 13.
- Your mom's age is 3(18) - 1 = 53.

The sum of your ages is 15 + 18 + 13 + 53 = 99, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 14: 
- Your age is 14.
- Your brother's age is 14 + 3 = 17.
- Your sister's age is 14 - 2 = 12.
- Your mom's age is 3(17) - 1 = 50.

The sum of your ages is 14 + 17 + 12 + 50 = 93, which is greater than 87.

Let's try x = 13: 
- Your age is 13.
- Your brother's age is 13 + 3 = 16.
- Your sister's age is 13 - 2 = 11.
- Your mom's age is 3(16) - 1 = 47.

The sum of your ages is 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87.

The solution to the problem is x = 13.

"As a hydrologist, I can analyze the situation using the principles of fluid dynamics and water flow. The river's water flow can be modeled using the concept of a linear equation, where the amount of water (Q) at any given time (t) is directly proportional to the initial amount of water (Q0) and the rate of change (r).

Given that the initial amount of water is 4000 gallons, and the rate of change is 6000 gallons on the third day, we can set up the following equation:

Q = Q0 + rt

where Q is the amount of water at time t, Q0 is the initial amount of water (4000 gallons), r is the rate of change (6000 gallons), and t is the time (3 days).

Substituting the given values, we get:

Q = 4000 + 6000(3)
Q = 4000 + 18000
Q = 20000

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 20000 gallons.

Final answer: 20000"
"The problem at hand is a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled using the formula for compound interest. In this case, we have an initial population of 10 people, and each person infects 6 others, resulting in a growth rate of 6.

To calculate the total number of people infected after three days, we can use the formula for exponential growth:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = total number of people infected after n days
P = initial population (10)
r = growth rate (6/10 or 0.6, since each person infects 6 others)
n = number of days (3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 10(1 + 0.6)^3
A = 10(1.6)^3
A = 10 * 4.096
A = 40.96

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:

A ≈ 41

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is approximately 41.

"To calculate the total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela, we can use the concept of percentages. Since Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela, we can calculate her share as 90% of Rafaela's total tips.

Rafaela's total tips = 40 * $20 = $800

Julieta's total tips = 90% of $800 = 0.9 * $800 = $720

The total amount of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela is $800 + $720 = $1520.

The final answer is: $1520"
"To determine the number of oranges Jennifer remained with, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to find the total number of oranges given away. Since Jennifer gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, we can calculate this as 2 * 3 = 6 oranges. Additionally, she gave 3 oranges to her son. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

Now, we subtract the total oranges given away from the total oranges bought: 12 - 9 = 3.

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"Let's dive into the world of badge-earning dynamics.

To calculate the number of badges each girl earns in a year, we need to consider their individual badge-earning rates. Claire earns 1 badge per month, which translates to 12 badges in a year. This can be represented as 12.

Amber, on the other hand, takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. This means she earns half the number of badges Claire does in the same time frame. Therefore, Amber's badge-earning rate is 1/2, which is equivalent to 6 badges in a year.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. This can be calculated as 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badge count from Wendy's badge count: 36 - 6 = 30.

The final answer is: 30"
"As a baking expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a precise calculation.

Paige baked 10 loaves of banana bread, with each loaf cut into 8 slices. To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of loaves by the number of slices per loaf: 10 * 8 = 80 slices.

Since each slice is sold for $0.50, we can calculate the total amount raised by multiplying the number of slices by the price per slice: 80 * $0.50 = $40.

The final answer is: $40"
"Let's dive into the world of coin collection and solve the problem at hand.

We're given that Gretchen has some coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins. We know that she has 70 gold coins. To find the total number of coins, we need to determine the number of silver coins.

Let's use algebra to represent the situation. Let x be the number of silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins can be represented as x + 30. We know that the number of gold coins is 70, so we can set up the equation:

x + 30 = 70

To solve for x, we subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

x = 70 - 30
x = 40

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the total number of coins by adding the number of gold coins and silver coins:

Total coins = 70 (gold) + 40 (silver)
Total coins = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

The final answer is: 110"
"To calculate the total number of leftover burritos, we need to first determine the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student received 10 burritos, we can calculate this as follows:

Total burritos given to students = Number of students * Number of burritos per student
Total burritos given to students = 50 * 10
Total burritos given to students = 500

Next, we need to subtract the number of burritos Mr. George ate from the total number of burritos given to the students to find the number of leftover burritos:

Number of leftover burritos = Total burritos given to students - Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George
Number of leftover burritos = 500 - 20
Number of leftover burritos = 480

The final answer is 480."
"Let's break down the information given:

We know the rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

Since they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The final answer is 23."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the number of books each person has. Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as x.

Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, we can express Anne's books as x - 12. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie's books can be represented as (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13.

The total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is: $\boxed{28}$"
"To determine the weight of the carrots, we need to first find the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh 2 * 5 = 10 pounds.

The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the total cost of the jello, we need to calculate the number of boxes required and then multiply it by the price per box.

Number of kids: 30
Number of cups per kid: 4
Total cups needed: 30 * 4 = 120 cups

Since a 3-ounce box makes 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed by dividing the total cups needed by 10.

Number of boxes needed: 120 cups / 10 cups per box = 12 boxes

Now, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of boxes needed by the price per box.

Total cost = Number of boxes needed * Price per box
Total cost = 12 boxes * $1.25 per box
Total cost = $15

The final answer is: $15"
"To calculate the change, we need to subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given. 

The total cost of the phones is $700 per phone multiplied by the number of phones, which is 5. 

$700 * 5 = $3500

The seller gave $4000 in total. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"To determine Keenan's weekly grocery expenditure, we need to calculate his monthly expenditure first. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. 

The total monthly expenditure is $400. To find Keenan's monthly expenditure, we multiply the total expenditure by 0.4 (which represents 40%):

$400 * 0.4 = $160

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly expenditure by 4 to find his weekly expenditure:

$160 ÷ 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

The final answer is $40."
"To calculate the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten, we need to break down his consumption over the three days.

On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces. To find this, we multiply 2/5 by 60.

2/5 * 60 = 24

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

Now, let's find out how many pieces are left after the first two days:
60 - 24 - 10 = 26

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces. To find this, we multiply 7/13 by 26.

7/13 * 26 = 14.31 (round down to 14 since you can't eat a fraction of a piece)

Now, let's add up the pieces he ate each day:
24 + 10 + 14 = 48

Tobias has eaten 48 pieces so far.

Final answer: 48"
"To calculate the total cost of the items David wants to buy, we need to multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle.

The cost of 3 bottles of soda is 3 x $21.00 = $63.00
The cost of 2 bottles of water is 2 x $8.00 = $16.00

The total cost is $63.00 + $16.00 = $79.00

The final answer is: $79.00"
"To calculate the amount of money David has left after purchasing the bolts, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Bolts * Cost per Bolt
Total Cost = 16 * $0.03
Total Cost = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money David has:

Remaining Amount = Initial Amount - Total Cost
Remaining Amount = $12.48 - $0.48
Remaining Amount = $12.00

Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts."
"As a canine behaviorist, I can provide a straightforward calculation to determine Ella's earnings after 12 hours of dog walking.

To find Ella's hourly rate, we can divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

Hourly rate = Total earnings / Total hours
Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours
Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can multiply the hourly rate by the total hours she will work to find her total earnings:

Total earnings = Hourly rate * Total hours
Total earnings = $11 per hour * 12 hours
Total earnings = $132

The final answer is: $132"
"To determine the number of marbles Paul has left, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we need to calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gives him 28 marbles. This can be represented as:

Initial marbles + marbles given by friend = Total marbles
52 + 28 = 80

Next, we need to find 1/4 of the total marbles, which can be calculated as:

1/4 × 80 = 20

Since Paul loses 1/4 of his marbles, we subtract the lost marbles from the total:

80 - 20 = 60

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.

The final answer is 60."
"To calculate Amy's total score, we need to consider the weighted points for each type of question. The multiple-choice and true/false questions are worth 1 point each, while the long-answer questions are worth 5 points each.

First, let's calculate the points from the multiple-choice questions: 80% of 10 questions = 0.8 * 10 = 8 points. Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions are 8.

Next, we calculate the points from the true/false questions: 90% of 20 questions = 0.9 * 20 = 18 points. Again, each true/false question is worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions are 18.

Lastly, we calculate the points from the long-answer questions: 60% of 5 questions = 0.6 * 5 = 3 points. Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions are 3 * 5 = 15.

Now, we add the points from each type of question to find Amy's total score: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

The final answer is 41."
"To determine the cost price of the chickens, we can use the formula:

Cost Price = Selling Price - Profit

Given that Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of 300 chickens at $50 each and wants to make a profit of $2000, we can calculate the total selling price as:

Total Selling Price = (3/5) * 300 * $50
= 3/5 * 15000
= 9000

Now, we can find the cost price by subtracting the desired profit:

Cost Price = Total Selling Price - Profit
= $9000 - $2000
= $7000

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

The final answer is: $7000"
"To determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses sold by 3 to find the number of glasses each person sold.

32 glasses / 3 people = 10.67 glasses per person

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, Micah also sold 10.67 glasses. 

Now, we can find the difference between Julie's sales and Micah's sales:

14 glasses (Julie) - 10.67 glasses (Micah) = 3.33 glasses

The final answer is: $\boxed{3.33}$"
"To calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa, we need to determine the cost of each service and add them together.

The total amount Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to calculate the cost of the new rope and subtract it from the amount she has.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so the total cost is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Sarah has the rope for $2 per meter, and it's 20 meters long, so she has:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Now, let's subtract the cost of the new rope from the amount Sarah has:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope."
"To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age. 

Let's denote Melanie's present age as 'x'. Since her age will be thrice her present age in a certain number of years, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 3x

where 'y' is the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

y = 2x

Since Melanie's present age is 8 years, we can substitute x = 8 into the equation:

y = 2(8)
y = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is: 16"

The cost of 6 packets of chicken is 6 x 2 = $12.
The cost of 3 packs of strawberries is 3 x $4 = $12.
The cost of 7 packs of apples is 7 x $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
$10 + $12 + $12 + $14 = $48

Kelly's budget is $65, so to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
$65 - $48 = $17

Therefore, Kelly has $17 left in her budget."
"To determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the length of her usual concert as 'x'. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, we can express the total runtime of the final concert as 2x. We also know that the final concert includes a 15-minute encore, so the total runtime without the encore is 2x - 15. Given that the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation:

2x - 15 = 65

To solve for x, we can add 15 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 + 15
2x = 80

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 80 / 2
x = 40

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 40 minutes.

The final answer is: 40"

"As a blue-loving, math-savvy individual, I'm happy to help you with the problem.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we need to add the number of chimichangas made on each day.

On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas each day, so the total for these two days is 125 + 125 = 250.

On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas, so they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Now, we add the total number of chimichangas made on all three days: 250 + 250 = 500.

The total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To determine the number of pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange, we need to first find the number of microphones that can fit in pairs. 

Let's denote the total number of microphones as 'T'. Since 20% of the microphones won't fit, the number of microphones that won't fit is 0.2 * T. 

The number of microphones that can fit in pairs is T - 0.2T = 0.8T. 

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is 0.8T / 2 = 0.4T.

We know that T = 50. Therefore, the number of pairs is 0.4 * 50 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"To calculate the total number of birds, we need to break down the information into separate components and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of birds flying overhead. Since 2/3 of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead, we can calculate this as:

(2/3) * 6 = 4

Next, we have 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group:

3 * 8 = 24

Now, we add the number of birds in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding to get the total:

6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of 34 birds.

The final answer is: 34"

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we need to break down the information step by step.

First, we find the number of indoor plants, which is one-fourth of the total plants. This can be calculated as:

(1/4) * 100 = 25

Now, we subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants to find the remaining plants:

100 - 25 = 75

Next, we find the number of outdoor plants, which is two-thirds of the remaining plants. This can be calculated as:

(2/3) * 75 = 50

Finally, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:

75 - 50 = 25

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100:

(25 / 100) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The final answer is 25%."
"The problem at hand involves determining the speed of a whirligig based on its relationship to the speed of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit. As a color theorist, I'll focus on the mathematical aspects of the problem.

Given that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can express this relationship as a ratio: whatchamacallit's speed = 11 * thingamabob's speed. We're also given that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. 

Let's denote the thingamabob's speed as x. Then, the whatchamacallit's speed is 11x. We can set up the equation: 
11x = 121 
To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: 
x = 121 / 11 
x = 11 

Now that we know the thingamabob's speed is 11 meters per second, we can find the whirligig's speed. Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we multiply the thingamabob's speed by 5: 
Whirligig's speed = 5 * 11 
Whirligig's speed = 55 meters per second 

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we need to first find the total cost of the salad and yogurt. 

The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. 

The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. 

Since Ellen pays $11 in total, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2. 

Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day."
"Let's break down Mark's new weekly earnings. 

Mark's original hourly wage was $10. His pay was increased by $2 per hour. To find his new hourly wage, we add the raise to his original wage:

$10 + $2 = $12

Since Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, we multiply his new wage by the number of hours he works per week and the number of days he works per week:

$12 * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = $480

Therefore, Mark now makes $480 per week."
"To determine the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to analyze the given information. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The amount she earned from mowing lawns can be calculated by considering the number of times she mowed each lawn.

Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as x. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times and Alba's lawn 5x times. Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is 6x.

We can set up the equation: 6x = 80

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:
x = 80 / 6
x = 13.33

Since we can't mow a lawn a fraction of a time, we'll round down to 13.

Now, we can find the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:
6x = 6 * 13
6x = 78

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she earned from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
80 - 78 = 2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine Harry's weight, we can follow the given information step by step.

First, we know Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.

The final answer is: $\boxed{74}$"
"To calculate John's profit, we need to consider the total amount he earns from renting his car and subtract his car payment.

To find the profit, we subtract the car payment of $500 from the total earnings: $750 - $500 = $250.

Therefore, John's monthly profit is $250.

The final answer is: $250"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of notebooks Joseph had initially as x. Since Martha had 3 times as many notebooks as Joseph, we can set up the equation:

3x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 7 / 3
x = 2.33 (approximately)

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has approximately 2.33 notebooks. To find the difference, we subtract Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

7 - 2.33 = 4.67

Since the question asks for the difference in the number of notebooks, we can express this as a multiple-choice question:

Martha has 4.67 more notebooks than Joseph.

A) 4
B) 4.67
C) 5
D) 6

"To calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can represent Anis' distance as 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 times Dijana's distance.

Let's denote Dijana's distance as x. Then, Anis' distance can be represented as (6/5)x.

We know that Dijana's distance is 50 miles, so we can set up the equation:
x = 50

Now, we can find Anis' distance:
Anis' distance = (6/5)x
= (6/5)(50)
= 60

To find the total distance rowed by both of them, we can add their individual distances:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
= 50 + 60
= 110

The final answer is: $\boxed{110}$"
"To determine the number of cookies each nephew will receive, we need to subtract the cookies taken by Susan's husband from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 100
Cookies taken by husband = 4

Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies taken by husband
Remaining cookies = 100 - 4
Remaining cookies = 96

Now, we can divide the remaining cookies among Susan's 6 nephews. Since we're dealing with a whole number division, we can perform the division as follows:

Cookies per nephew = Remaining cookies ÷ Number of nephews
Cookies per nephew = 96 ÷ 6
Cookies per nephew = 16

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

The final answer is 16."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages while Daniel read 13 pages. This means the difference in pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday is 13 - 10 = 3 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel didn't read any pages today, Denise read 5 more pages than the 13 pages Daniel read yesterday. So, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we need to subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise. Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 23 pages (10 + 13). So, Denise read 18 - 23 = -5 pages more than Daniel.

However, since we can't have a negative number of pages, we need to re-evaluate the calculation. Let's recheck the calculation: Denise read 18 pages and Daniel read 23 pages. To find the difference, we need to subtract 23 from 18, which gives us -5. This means Denise actually read 5 fewer pages than Daniel.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch, we need to consider the total number of bowls available and the number of bowls consumed for dinner.

Since Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, and there are four adults, he has 4 bowls of soup. 

Now, we need to subtract the bowls that will be eaten for dinner. There are 4 adults, so 4 bowls will be eaten for dinner.

4 bowls (total) - 4 bowls (eaten for dinner) = 0 bowls left for lunch.

Since there are 2 children and 0 bowls left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch.

The final answer is: 0"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of notebooks by the cost per notebook and add the cost of the ballpen.

"To calculate the total material needed for the face masks, we can break it down into two components: small masks and large masks.

For small masks, we know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. To find the material needed for 20 small masks, we can set up a proportion:

(4 small masks / 2 yards) = (20 small masks / x yards)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

4x = 20 * 2
4x = 40
x = 40 / 4
x = 10 yards

So, 10 yards of material are needed for 20 small masks.

For large masks, we know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. To find the material needed for 8 large masks, we can set up a proportion:

(3 large masks / 2.25 yards) = (8 large masks / x yards)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 8 * 2.25
3x = 18
x = 18 / 3
x = 6 yards

So, 6 yards of material are needed for 8 large masks.

To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small and large masks:

Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the average price per ticket, we can use the formula:

Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets

Given that Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies in the theatre three times, the total number of tickets is 9 * 3 = 27.

Total amount spent = $216

Average price per ticket = $216 / 27

To find the average price per ticket, we can perform the division:

$216 ÷ 27 = $8

Therefore, the average price per ticket is $8."
"To determine Harold's free time, we need to calculate the total hours in a day (24 hours) and subtract the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours, works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.
He walks his dog for 1 hour.

Total hours spent on these activities: 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (walking dog) = 19 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day: 24 - 19 = 5 hours

Harold has 5 hours of free time in his day.

"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we need to calculate the difference between his initial number of books and the number of books he lost.

Joseph initially had twice the number of books Sarah had, which is 2 * 9 = 18 books. After losing 2 books, he is left with 18 - 2 = 16 books.

Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To determine the number of marbles Dean has left, we need to calculate the marbles he gave away and subtract that from his initial amount.

Dean initially has 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is equivalent to 6 marbles (1/5 * 30 = 6). He also gives 10 marbles to Donald.

The total marbles given away is 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16.

Now, we subtract the marbles given away from the initial amount:

30 (initial marbles) - 16 (marbles given away) = 14

Therefore, Dean has 14 marbles left.

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote Adam's current age as 'x'. Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, we can set up the equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 * Adam's age 4 years ago
60 - 8 = 2 * (x - 4)
52 = 2x - 8

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
52 + 8 = 2x
60 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':
x = 60 / 2
x = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
Adam's age in 8 years = 38

The final answer is: 38"
"To find the total number of acres of the two farms, we need to calculate the acres of Farmer Smith's farm first. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Twice that of Farmer Brown's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than that, so it is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now, we add the acres of both farms together: 200 (Farmer Brown's farm) + 500 (Farmer Smith's farm) = 700 acres.

The total number of acres of the two farms is 700."
"As a packaging expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Colby's earnings.

To calculate Colby's daily earnings, we need to first determine the number of packages he completes in an 8-hour workday. Since he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we can calculate this as follows:

Packages per hour = 50 - 10 = 40

Since Colby works for 8 hours, the total number of packages he completes in a day is:

Total packages per day = Packages per hour * 8
= 40 * 8
= 320

Given that Colby earns $0.20 for every package, his daily earnings can be calculated as:

Daily earnings = Total packages per day * Package rate
= 320 * $0.20
= $64

Therefore, Colby earns $64 in a typical 8-hour workday.

The final answer is: $64"
"To calculate the total number of bottles John drinks, we need to determine the total time spent on sudoku puzzles and then divide it by the time interval between each bottle.

A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes. The total time spent on sudoku is the sum of these two times: 45 + 180 = 225 minutes.

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can divide the total time by 30 minutes to find the number of bottles he drinks: 225 minutes / 30 minutes = 7.5.

However, since you can't drink half a bottle, we'll round down to 7 bottles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, and there were 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

The total number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons is 58 - 40 = 18. Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can set up the equation 3y = 18 to find the number of yellow balloons.

Solving for y, we get y = 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

6"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we can calculate the total miles driven in 30 days and then divide by the interval at which the tune-ups are required.

Jon drives 100 miles per day, so in 30 days, he drives a total of:
100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since the tune-ups are required every 1000 miles, we can divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in 30 days."
"To calculate the total hours worked by Bruce, we can break down the hours worked each day:

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. 
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

The total hours worked by Bruce in these three days is the sum of the hours worked each day: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.

The final answer is 23."
"To determine the amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount they spent.

The cost of the cake is $11, and the cost of 1 dozen balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6. The total amount spent so far is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) = $17.

They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

The total amount spent is $17 (cake and balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $31.

Since they started with the same amount of money, we can set up an equation: x + x = 31, where x is the amount of money each girl received.

Combine like terms: 2x = 31

Divide both sides by 2: x = 31 / 2
x = 15.5

The amount of money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them is $15.50."
"To determine the total number of fruits Kira has left, we need to calculate the initial total and then subtract the number of fruits eaten by Lola.

The total number of fruits initially is the sum of apples, bananas, and oranges: 3 (apples) + 5 (bananas) + 6 (oranges) = 14.

Since Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, we subtract 2 from the total: 14 - 2 = 12.

Therefore, Kira has 12 pieces of fruit left.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."
"To determine the total number of students, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and add them together.

There are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, which is 2 * 6 = 12. 

The number of students playing soccer is given as 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is 16 + 22 = 38.

Now, let's add the number of students in each group: 6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56.

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

The final answer is: $\boxed{56}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money raised from selling lollipops, we need to consider the number of lollipops sold and the profit per lollipop.

The number of lollipops sold can be calculated by multiplying the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold. In this case, there are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops.

Number of lollipops sold = 30 students * 10 lollipops/student
= 300 lollipops

The profit per lollipop is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. The selling price is $0.8 per lollipop, and the cost price is $0.5 per lollipop.

Profit per lollipop = Selling price - Cost price
= $0.8 - $0.5
= $0.3

Now, we can calculate the total profit by multiplying the number of lollipops sold by the profit per lollipop.

Total profit = Number of lollipops sold * Profit per lollipop
= 300 lollipops * $0.3
= $90

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

The final answer is: $90"
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information into separate components and calculate each one.

First, we know Larry has 3 cats. Then, he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, which is 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.

Next, we're told he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is 9 - 2 = 7.

The fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is 3 * 7 = 21.

Lastly, the collection of gerbils is 1/3 the number of fish, which is 1/3 * 21 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the total number of pets: 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils) = 47.

The total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine the number of days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices each person eats per day and then divide the total number of slices in the loaf by this amount.

Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices per day.

The total number of slices eaten per day is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.

Now, we divide the total number of slices in the loaf (24) by the total slices eaten per day (6):

24 ÷ 6 = 4

The loaf of bread will last 4 days.

The final answer is: 4"
"To calculate the total number of shells Martha has collected, we can use the formula for calculating the total number of months she has been collecting shells:

Total months = (Current age - Starting age) * 12

In this case, Martha is 10 years old and started collecting shells at 5 years old. Plugging in the values, we get:

Total months = (10 - 5) * 12
Total months = 5 * 12
Total months = 60

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected is equal to the total number of months:

Total shells = Total months
Total shells = 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row, we need to divide the total number of mint tea cups by the number of rows. Since Lana has 27 cups in total and brews 15 cups of cinnamon tea, the number of cups of mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12.

Now, we can divide the total number of mint tea cups by 3 to find the number of cups in each row: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, we need to consider the total time available and the time spent on each trip. The sloth can make 8 hours worth of trips in 8 hours, and each round trip takes 4 hours.

Since the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, we can calculate the number of berries he can pick per trip by dividing the total number of berries he wants to collect (24) by the number of trips (2).

24 ÷ 2 = 12

Therefore, the sloth can pick 12 berries per trip.

The final answer is 12."
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank, we need to calculate the net change in the tank's water level over 6 days. 

The tank is initially filled with 5000 gallons of water. Since the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, the net change in the tank's water level can be calculated as follows:

Net change = Initial water - (Emptying rate * Number of days)
Net change = 5000 - (500 * 6)
Net change = 5000 - 3000
Net change = 2000 gallons

The final amount of water in the tank after 6 days will be the initial amount minus the net change.

The final answer is: $oxed{2000}$"
"Let's break down Colby's expenses to determine how many movies he can see.

Colby's monthly allowance is $150. He has already spent $8 on popcorn and $8 on candy, so he has $150 - $8 - $8 = $134 left.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10. Colby wants to buy a ticket, so he will spend $10. Now he has $134 - $10 = $124 left.

To find out how many movies he can see, we need to divide the remaining money by the cost of a movie ticket. Since it's a Friday, the ticket costs $10.

$124 ÷ $10 = 12.4

Since Colby can't buy a fraction of a movie ticket, he can see 12 movies.

Final answer: 12"
"As a pastry nutrition expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the calorie content of the pastries Andrew baked.

To calculate the total calories of the pastries, we need to consider the calorie reduction for each type of pastry. Since a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, we can calculate the calories for each type of pastry as follows:

Mini Cinnamon Roll: 1/3 * 600 = 200 calories
Mini Blueberry Muffin: 1/3 * 450 = 150 calories

Now, let's calculate the total calories of the pastries:
200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories = 40,000 calories
300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories = 45,000 calories

Total calories = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories

Therefore, the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000."
"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to add up the total number of Junebugs removed and divide by the number of days.

Let's break it down:

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, which is 2 x 39 = 78 Junebugs.
So, the total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

There are 5 days in total (Monday to Friday).
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
= 300 / 5
= 60

The final answer is 60."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

The bus's speed is 60 miles per hour, and it traveled for 5 hours. Using the formula Distance = Speed * Time, we can calculate the distance the bus traveled:

Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
Distance = 300 miles

The car's speed is 30 miles per hour, and it traveled for 8 hours. Using the same formula, we can calculate the distance the car traveled:

Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
Distance = 240 miles

To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

Let's calculate the total number of toys Sophie initially had: 
Blocks = 31
Stuffed animals = 8
Rings = 9

Total initial toys = Blocks + Stuffed animals + Rings
= 31 + 8 + 9
= 48

Since Sophie now has a total of 62 toys, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the total initial toys from the current total:
Bouncy balls = Total current toys - Total initial toys
= 62 - 48
= 14

The final answer is 14."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's represent Peter's age as P, Paul's age as P + 10, and Jean's age as J.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years, so we can write the equation:

P + (P + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

2P + J + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2P + J = 90

We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's and Jean's age, so we can write another equation:

P = (P + 10) + J

Subtract P from both sides:

0 = 10 + J

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now that we have J, we can find P:

P + J = 90
P + (-10) = 90

Subtract -10 from both sides:

P = 100

However, this solution is inconsistent with the initial equation P + J = 90. Let's re-examine the system of equations.

We can rewrite the second equation as:

P - P = J + 10

This simplifies to:

0 = J + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides:

-J = 10

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = -10

Now, substitute J = -10 into the first equation:

2P + (-10) = 90

Add 10 to both sides:

2P = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

P = 50

The final answer is 50."
"Let's dive into the world of water balloon math. As a water balloon enthusiast, I'm excited to calculate the total number of balloons.

Initially, Maria and her 4 friends had 2 balloons each, which can be represented as 2 * 5 = 10 balloons. Adding Maria's 1 balloon, the total becomes 10 + 1 = 11 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is 3 * 5 = 15 balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial 11 balloons to the additional 15 balloons: 11 + 15 = 26 balloons.

The final answer is: 26"
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we must first calculate the total number of boxes available. The charity group has 10 people donating 5 boxes each, resulting in 10 * 5 = 50 boxes. Additionally, they already possess 10 boxes, bringing the total to 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.

Since each table can accommodate 2 boxes, we can calculate the required number of tables by dividing the total number of boxes by 2.

Number of tables needed = Total boxes / 2
= 60 boxes / 2
= 30 tables

As the charity group already has 15 tables, we can find the number of new tables required by subtracting the existing tables from the total needed.

New tables needed = Total tables needed - Existing tables
= 30 tables - 15 tables
= 15 tables

The charity group needs 15 new tables to accommodate the donated and existing items."

Sydney's total distance spat is 35 seeds * 12 feet = 420 feet.

The total distance spat by both is 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2: 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"As a financial analyst specializing in widget production and sales, I've crunched the numbers to determine the difference in earnings between the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000.

To calculate the total revenue from each machine, we need to consider the number of widgets produced and the selling price of each widget. Let's break it down:

Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour: 60
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * $6 = $259,200

WidgetMaster 9000:
Widgets per hour: 45
Hours per day: 24
Days per month: 30
Total widgets per month: 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400
Selling price per widget: $6
Total revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * $6 = $194,400

To find the difference in total revenue, we subtract the total revenue from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the total revenue from the Widgeteer 3000:
$259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

The final answer is: $64,800"
"To determine the cost of Cameron's stay, we need to calculate the cost of the initial 12-hour stay and the additional hours.

The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.

Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. 

The cost of the additional 5 hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos.

The total cost of the extended stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the extended stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay: 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Cameron would save 250 pesos.

Final answer: 250"
"To determine the total amount of hay needed, we can calculate the amount of hay each animal requires and then sum them up.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, the total amount of hay needed for goats is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds.

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, which is 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds. With 12 sheep, the total amount of hay needed for sheep is 12 * 7 = 84 pounds.

The total amount of hay needed is the sum of the hay required for goats and sheep: 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{159}$"
"Let's break down John's situation step by step.

First, we need to calculate John's total earnings. Since he earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, his total earnings are:

50 * 6 = 300 dollars

Next, he spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with:

300 - 50 = 250 dollars

Then, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spends a total of:

5 * 10 = 50 dollars

Now, he has:

250 - 50 = 200 dollars left

He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has:

200 - 100 = 100 dollars left

To find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy, we divide the amount he has left by 25:

100 / 25 = 4

Therefore, John can buy 4 pens with the remaining 100 dollars.

The final answer is 4."

900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

The teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself."
"As a plumbing expert, I can confidently calculate the total cost of the job. To determine the total cost, we need to consider the fixed charge, labor cost, and the cost of parts.

The fixed charge is $40, and the labor cost is calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked (2.25 hours) by the hourly rate ($35 per hour). This gives us:

Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35 per hour = $78.75

The total cost of parts is $60.

To find the total cost, we add the labor cost, the fixed charge, and the cost of parts:

Total cost = Labor cost + Fixed charge + Cost of parts
Total cost = $78.75 + $40 + $60
Total cost = $178.75

Therefore, Patty charged a total of $178.75 for the job.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

James initially purchased 10 CDs at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of $150. Since he received a 40% discount, we can calculate the discount amount as follows:

Discount amount = Total cost of CDs * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $150 * 0.4
Discount amount = $60

The total cost after the discount is:

Total cost after discount = Total cost of CDs - Discount amount
Total cost after discount = $150 - $60
Total cost after discount = $90

James then sold 5 CDs for $40 each, resulting in a total revenue of:

Total revenue from selling CDs = Number of CDs sold * Price per CD
Total revenue from selling CDs = 5 * $40
Total revenue from selling CDs = $200

To determine how much James was out, we subtract the total revenue from the total cost after the discount:

Amount James was out = Total cost after discount - Total revenue from selling CDs
Amount James was out = $90 - $200
Amount James was out = -$110

Since James was out $110, he actually lost $110.

Final answer: $110"

"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of loaves Sam had last Friday as 'x'. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had. This can be represented as 7x - 40.

We are given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, so we can set up the equation:

7x - 40 = 70

To solve for x, we can add 40 to both sides of the equation:

7x = 70 + 40
7x = 110

Next, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 110 / 7
x = 15.71 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's more accurate to keep the exact value of x as 110/7.

Now, we can find the number of loaves the bakery has by substituting the value of x into the expression 7x - 40:

Number of loaves = 7 * (110/7) - 40
= 110 - 40
= 70

The bakery has 70 loaves of bread.

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To determine the total number of stickers Jasmine has, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, she was given 15 stickers for participating in class. Then, she lost 7 stickers during playtime. To find the remaining stickers, we subtract 7 from 15: 15 - 7 = 8.

Next, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. To find the total number of stickers Jasmine has now, we add 5 to 8: 8 + 5 = 13.

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

The final answer is 13."
"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to consider the commission rates and the number of copies sold for each newspaper.

The commission for the New York Times is 10% of the cost of each copy, which is 6 copies * $5 = 30. Then, we multiply this by the commission rate: 30 * 0.1 = $3.

The commission for the Wall Street Journal is 8% of the cost of each copy, which is 10 copies * $15 = 150. Then, we multiply this by the commission rate: 150 * 0.08 = $12.

To find the total commission, we add the commissions for both newspapers: $3 + $12 = $15.

The final answer is $15."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let's denote Leo's age as L, Deanna's age as D, and Marcus's age as M.

We are given that Deanna is 26 years old, so D = 26.

We also know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so M = D - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21.

Additionally, we are told that Marcus is half of Leo's age, so M = L/2.

Substituting the value of M into the equation M = L/2, we get 21 = L/2.

To solve for L, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, resulting in L = 2 * 21 = 42.

Therefore, Leo's age is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of points scored by Dinar as x. Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, we can represent Bahati's score as (x + 20). We know that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can also represent Bahati's score as (x + 10).

The total points scored by all three team members is 45. We can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + ((x + 10) - 20) = 45

Combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 45

Add 10 to both sides:

3x = 55

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 55/3

x = 18.33

Since the number of points scored cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can express the exact value of x as a fraction.

Now, we can find Azibo's score by substituting the value of x into the expression (x + 10):

Azibo's score = (18.33 + 10)
= 28.33

However, since the number of points scored cannot be a fraction, we can round down to the nearest whole number. But in this case, we can express the exact value of Azibo's score as a fraction.

Azibo's score = (55/3 + 10)
= (55 + 30)/3
= 85/3

To express the answer in a more conventional format, we can convert the fraction to a mixed number:

Azibo's score = 28 1/3

However, since the answer should be in a specific format, we can express it as a decimal and then round it to the nearest whole number.

Azibo's score ≈ 28.33

Since the answer should be in a specific format, we can express it as a whole number.

Azibo's score ≈ 28

The final answer is 28."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the given information that the book is 1.5 inches thick and the paper is 100 pages to the inch. Since each paper is printed on both sides, the number of pages per inch is 2.

Let's calculate the total number of pages in the book:

Number of pages per inch = 2
Thickness of the book = 1.5 inches

Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch * Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 2 * 1.5
Total number of pages = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total number of reports stapled by Vince, we need to determine the total minutes he worked and then divide that by the time interval at which he staples reports.

Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is a total of 15 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying 15 hours by 60.

Total minutes = 15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the total number of reports stapled.

Total reports = 900 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 60 reports

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total minutes she slept and subtract the minutes she woke up early.

Kim's usual sleep duration is 8 hours, which is equivalent to 480 minutes. However, she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract 5 minutes from the total minutes she slept:

480 - 5 = 475 minutes

Additionally, she woke up from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is 23 minutes. We need to add these minutes to the total:

475 + 23 = 498 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept for 498 minutes on her bed that day.

The final answer is: $\boxed{498}$"
"To determine the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we need to calculate the number of measuring spoons he has after gifting Pedro 6 spoons. 

Jonathan initially has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Since he has 2 dozen cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 * 2 dozen
= 2/3 * 24
= (2 * 24) / 3
= 48 / 3
= 16

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan is left with:
16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Jonathan has 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the total number of utensils he has remaining is:
24 (measuring cups) + 10 (measuring spoons) = 34

The final answer is 34."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to consider the initial capacity and the daily admissions.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with 1/5 occupied, which means the initial number of occupied beds is:
(1/5) * 1000 = 200 beds

Since 50 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 14 days is:
50 * 14 = 700 patients

The number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is the initial number of unoccupied beds minus the number of patients admitted:
1000 - 200 - 700 = 100 beds

The final answer is: 100"
"To determine the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find the number of non-work emails:
Total emails per day = 16
Work emails per day = 7
Non-work emails per day = Total emails per day - Work emails per day
Non-work emails per day = 16 - 7
Non-work emails per day = 9

Next, we calculate the number of emails to family:
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to family per day = (2/3) * 9
Emails to family per day = 6

Now, we find the number of emails to her boyfriend:
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * Non-work emails per day
Emails to boyfriend per day = (1/3) * 9
Emails to boyfriend per day = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we can use the given information. Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3.

Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years

Now, we know Shawna's age, and we are told that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. To find Shawna's father's age, we multiply Shawna's age by 5.

Shawna's father's age = 9 * 5
Shawna's father's age = 45 years

The final answer is 45."
"To determine the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to calculate 20% of the number Courtney reported and subtract it from Courtney's number.

Let's calculate 20% of 48:
0.20 * 48 = 9.6

Now, subtract 9.6 from 48:
48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Therefore, the correct number of people who attended the concert is 38.4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{38.4}$"
"To determine the total number of basketballs, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's denote the number of balls carried by Jeffrey as x. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason's balls = 2x. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan's balls = 2(2x) = 4x.

We know that the total number of balls is the sum of the balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey. Since they carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls is equal to the sum of their individual balls. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = Total balls
7x = Total balls

We are also given that Jason carried 2 balls, which allows us to solve for x:

2 = 2x
x = 1

Now that we know x, we can find the total number of balls:

Total balls = 7x
Total balls = 7(1)
Total balls = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to analyze the given information. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 6 holes on the third day (after filling in 2 holes). 

The total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Total holes by the end of the fourth day = 4 * Total holes by the end of the third day
116 = 4 * 29

To find the number of holes dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total holes dug by the end of the third day from the total holes by the end of the fourth day:

Holes dug on the fourth day = Total holes by the end of the fourth day - Total holes by the end of the third day
= 116 - 29
= 87

The final answer is: $\boxed{87}$"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we can use the information given. Since Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 15 more than the others, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15. 

Let's denote the number of corn chips the others got as x. Then, Collins got x + 15. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + (x + 15) = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 155 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 77.5. However, since we can't have half a corn chip, this is an issue. We need to re-evaluate the problem.

Let's re-examine the information. If Collins got 15 more than the others, and Amora and Lainey got 70 each, we can represent Collins' corn chips as 70 + 15 = 85. Since there are three people in total, the sum of their corn chips is 3x. We know that Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, so 2 * 70 = 140. We can set up the equation 140 + 85 = 3x to find the value of x.

Simplifying the equation, we get 225 = 3x. Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 75. Now that we know x, we can find the total number of corn chips: 3x = 3 * 75 = 225.

The total number of corn chips is 225."
"To calculate the cost of the travel, we need to determine 50% of the cost of the supplies and add it to the cost of the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply by 0.5.

50% of $400 = 0.5 x $400 = $200

The cost of travel is the sum of the cost of supplies and 50% of the cost of supplies.

Cost of travel = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
= $400 + $200
= $600

The final answer is: $600"
"The Pokémon Catching Conundrum

In the world of Pokémon, understanding the relationships between the number of Pokémon caught by each trainer is crucial. As a Pokémon researcher specializing in trainer dynamics, I'll break down the problem step by step.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe as A, the number caught by Stan as S, and the number caught by Alex as X.

We know that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught is 339: A + S + X = 339
2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan: X = S + 5
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe: S = 4A - 13

To solve for S, we can substitute the value of X from equation 2 into equation 1:
A + S + (S + 5) = 339
Combine like terms:
2S + A + 5 = 339

Now, substitute the value of S from equation 3 into the above equation:
2(4A - 13) + A + 5 = 339
Expand and simplify:
8A - 26 + A + 5 = 339
Combine like terms:
9A - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:
9A = 360

Divide by 9:
A = 40

Now that we know A, we can find S:
S = 4A - 13
S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147

The final answer is 147."
"To determine the total time John will spend watching the show, we need to calculate the total number of episodes and then multiply it by the length of each episode.

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:

Total episodes = Total minutes per episode / 2
Total episodes = 20 / 2
Total episodes = 10

Now, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the total number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total time = Total episodes * Total minutes per episode
Total time = 10 * 20
Total time = 200

The final answer is: $\boxed{200}$"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we can use the concept of displacement. Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object. In this case, the bird's initial position is the northern home, and the final position is the southern home.

The bird travels 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the first direction is:
d1 = speed × time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

The bird then travels 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the second direction is:
d2 = speed × time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

The bird then travels 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so the distance traveled in the third direction is:
d3 = speed × time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Since the bird traveled 300 miles south and then 36 miles north, the net displacement is:
d = d1 - d2 = 300 miles - 36 miles = 264 miles

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 264 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{264}$"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies eaten.

Greta made 1 dozen (12) brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can represent this as 12.

She received 1/2 a dozen brownies at the office party. To convert this to a whole number, we multiply 1/2 by 12, which equals 6. So, she received 6 brownies at the office party.

Her friends brought 4 dozen brownies to her home. Again, 1 dozen equals 12, so 4 dozen equals 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.

Now, we add the brownies she made for herself, the ones she received at the office party, and the ones her friends brought to her home: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. To convert 1 1/2 to a whole number, we multiply 1 by 12 and add 1/2 * 12, which equals 12 + 6 = 18. So, 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies: 66 - 18 = 48.

Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

The final answer is 48."
"To calculate the total age of the family members, we need to find the age of Nani's brother and sister.

Nani's brother is twice his age, so his age is 2 x 8 = 16 years.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of his age. 
75% of 8 is 0.75 x 8 = 6 years.

Now, we have the ages of Nani (8), his brother (16), and his sister (6). 
The total age of the family members is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To calculate the total cost of the phones, we can break it down into two parts: the cost of the first two phones and the cost of the remaining phones.

The cost of the first two phones is 2 x $600 = $1200.

Since each phone after the first two is half price, the cost of the remaining phones is 3 x $300 (half of $600) = $900.

The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

The final answer is: $2100"
"In the context of team dynamics, understanding the number of players in each team is crucial for strategic planning and resource allocation. As a sports enthusiast and a fan of the color blue (which I find soothing, by the way), I'll focus on providing an accurate calculation.

Let's break it down:

Carlton's team has 13 players. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players in Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

Zeke's team = 13 + 7
Zeke's team = 20

To find the total number of players in both teams, we simply add the number of players in each team:

Total players = Carlton's team + Zeke's team
Total players = 13 + 20
Total players = 33

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams is 33.

The final answer is: 33"
"To calculate the total number of wooden slats needed, we must first determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the fence, which can be calculated using the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2 * (15 + 10)
Perimeter = 2 * 25
Perimeter = 50 feet

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats needed:

Total wooden slats needed = Perimeter * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 50 * 2
Total wooden slats needed = 100

The final answer is: $\boxed{100}$"
"To determine the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we need to consider the sequence of events.

The number of states in the USA is 50. Half of 50 is 25. 

India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so India has 25 + 4 = 29 states.

Now, we add the number of states in the USA and India: 
50 (USA) + 29 (India) = 79

The total number of states in both countries is 79."
"To determine the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can calculate the total cost of the books and subtract the amount he has saved.

The total cost of the books is $18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39.

Since Tyler has saved $14, we can find the amount he still needs by subtracting the saved amount from the total cost:

$39 - $14 = $25

To find the number of hours Tyler needs to work, we can divide the amount he still needs by his hourly wage of $5:

Number of hours = $25 / $5
= 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"Let's dive into the problem of sharing cherries among Richard, Jerry, and Robert. As a color theory enthusiast, I find the vibrant hues of the cherries quite fascinating, but I'll focus on the task at hand.

We're given that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard. To find out how many cherries Richard has, we can set up an equation:

Robert's cherries = Richard's cherries + 10
30 = Richard's cherries + 10
Richard's cherries = 30 - 10
Richard's cherries = 20

Now that we know Richard has 20 cherries, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the total number of cherries from the total number of cherries (60) and subtracting Robert's and Richard's cherries:

Jerry's cherries = Total cherries - Robert's cherries - Richard's cherries
Jerry's cherries = 60 - 30 - 20
Jerry's cherries = 10

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries = 30 - 10
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is: 20"
"To calculate the total earnings for Sunny's two-day fundraiser, we need to consider the sales of gingerbread and apple pie separately.

Let's denote the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday as G and the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday as A. We know that Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread on Saturday, so G = 10.

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday is G + 5. We also know that he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday, so the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday is A - 4.

We are given that Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, so we can set up the equation: G + 5 = 15. Solving for G, we get G = 10. This confirms our initial information.

We also know that Sunny sold 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday, which is 5 more than the number sold on Saturday. This also confirms our information.

To find the number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday, we can set up the equation: A - 4 = 6. Solving for A, we get A = 10.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each day:

- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $60
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread * $6 = $90
- 10 boxes of apple pie * $15 = $150

Total earnings for two days: $60 + $90 + $150 = $300

"To determine the number of sunscreen bottles Pamela will need, we can calculate the total number of hours she will be outside and then divide that by the amount of sunscreen she reappplies per hour.

Since she reappplies sunscreen every hour, we can multiply the number of hours she will be outside by 1 (since she reappplies 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour).

Total hours = 4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours
Total ounces needed = 32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, we can divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle to find the number of bottles she will need:
Number of bottles = Total ounces needed / Ounces per bottle
= 32 ounces / 8 ounces
= 4 bottles

Therefore, Pamela will need 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"As a color connoisseur, I can confidently say that the blue car is a stunning shade, but let's focus on the task at hand. Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100, we can calculate the price of the red car using the following formula:

Price of red car = Price of blue car - (40% of Price of blue car)
= $100 - (0.4 x $100)
= $100 - $40
= $60

Therefore, the red car costs $60.

The blue car costs $100.

The final answer is: $60"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Emil is currently 19 years old. We can represent his current age as E = 19.

When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can set up the equation 24 = D/2, where D represents his dad's age. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us D = 48.

We also know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can set up the equation 24 = 2B, where B represents his brother's age. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us B = 12.

Now, we need to find the sum of their ages. We already know that D = 48 and B = 12. The sum of their ages is D + B = 48 + 12 = 60.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne had, we need to calculate the sum of the beads given by her mother, sister, and friend.

Let's break it down:

- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add the beads: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

The total number of beads Adrianne had is 90.

Final Answer: The final answer is 90."
"To calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught, we need to consider the amount he caught each day.

First, we calculate the amount he caught on Friday, which is 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. This can be expressed as 4 * 3 pounds.

Friday's catch: 4 * 3 = 12 pounds

Next, we calculate the amount he caught on Saturday, which is half of his Friday's catch. This can be expressed as 12 / 2 pounds.

Saturday's catch: 12 / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, we add the amount he caught on each day to find the total amount: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can divide the total amount by 3 to find the number of servings: 21 / 3 = 7

The final answer is 7."
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group.

First, we find the number of football players: 20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students.

Next, we find the number of students remaining after removing the football players: 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then, we find the number of cheerleaders or band members: 25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students.

Finally, we add the number of football players and cheerleaders/band members to find the total number of students leaving early: 6 + 6 = 12 students.

The final answer is 12."
"To find the average size of the shoes, we need to first find the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, and Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.

Now, we can find the average size of the two shoes by adding the sizes together and dividing by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of the shoes is 15."
"To determine the total cost of the flowers, we need to calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy and then multiply that by the cost per flower.

The length of the flower bed is 111 feet, which is equivalent to 1332 inches. Since Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant, we can fit 1332 / 18 = 74 plants in the bed. However, Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 74 - 17 = 57 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost will be 57 * 6 = $342.

The final answer is: $342"
"To determine the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can use the concept of proportional reasoning. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

Let x be the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. We know that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so in a week, he eats 18 * 7 = 126 pretzels. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can set up the proportion:

x / 126 = 1/2

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 126 * 1/2
x = 63

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

The final answer is: 63"
"To calculate the total cost of filling the hanging baskets, we need to multiply the number of baskets by the number of items per basket and then multiply by the cost per item.

The cost of petunias per basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
The cost of sweet potato vines per basket is 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
The total cost per basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00
The total cost for 5 baskets is 5 * $14.00 = $70.00

The final answer is: $70.00"
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. Each rose needs 1 pound, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds.

To find out how many roses they can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each = 12 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each = 15 pounds.

Now, we add the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

Finally, we subtract the total amount of soil used from the total amount of soil they bought: 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her monthly savings and then divide it by the cost of a single pair of shoes.

Jessica's monthly income is $2,000, and she sets aside 25% of her income for shoes. This can be calculated as:

$2,000 * 0.25 = $500 per month

Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000, we can calculate the number of pairs she can buy in a year by dividing her monthly savings by the cost of a single pair:

$500 per month ÷ $1,000 per pair = 0.5 pairs per month

To find the total number of pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12:

0.5 pairs per month * 12 months = 6 pairs per year

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final answer is: 6"
"To determine the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we can break down the task into two parts: peeling and cooking.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the peeling rate:

Time to peel 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Peeling rate
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 / 6
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 15 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp. Since Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp by the cooking rate:

Time to cook 90 shrimp = Total shrimp / Cooking rate
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 90 / 30
Time to cook 90 shrimp = 3 minutes

Now, we can find the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp by adding the time for peeling and cooking:

Total time = Time to peel + Time to cook
Total time = 15 minutes + 3 minutes
Total time = 18 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Final answer: $\boxed{18}$"
"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we need to consider the cooling and warming effects of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled 3 x 2 = 6 degrees.

2. Then, it was turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room an additional 3 degrees per hour. So, the room was cooled an additional 4 x 3 = 12 degrees.

3. The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

4. The room will warm up at 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running. Since the air conditioner was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.

5. The final temperature difference from the starting temperature is the total cooling effect minus the warming effect: Final temperature difference = Total cooling effect - Warming effect = 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet as x. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(x + 30). Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can set up the equation:

3(x + 30) = 90

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 90 = 90

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

3x = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

x = 0

Since x represents the number of years that have passed since Bill's dad saw the comet, we can find the number of years that have passed since Bill was born by adding 30 to x, which is 30 years.

Now, we know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age at that time, which is 3(30 + 30) = 3(60) = 180 years old. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he saw the comet by subtracting 30 from 180, which is 150 years.

However, we are asked to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Since Bill saw the comet 30 years after he was born, we can find Bill's age when he was born by subtracting 30 from 150, which is 120 years.

The final answer is 120."
"As a financial analyst, I can break down Buford's check-writing habits to determine the total number of checks he writes per year.

To calculate the total number of checks, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check. 

Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, so that's 12 checks per year. He also writes a check for the gas bill once per month, adding another 12 checks per year. 

Additionally, he writes two checks per month to the church, which translates to 24 checks per year. Lastly, he writes four checks per year to the pest and lawn service, as there are four quarters in a year.

Now, let's add up the total number of checks: 12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks per year.

The final answer is 52."
"To determine the number of flights the first plane makes to France, we need to calculate the total number of flights it makes in a day. 

Since the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes, we can calculate the total number of flights made by the first plane as 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

The first plane makes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, so it makes 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights to Greece.

The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the first plane makes 88 - 66 = 22 flights to France and Germany.

Since the flights to France and Germany are split equally, the first plane makes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11}$"
"The problem at hand involves determining the combined length of time for the howls of three wolves, Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous. To approach this, we need to understand the duration of each wolf's howl and then add them together.

We know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, we can calculate Chikote's howl duration as 2 * 20 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous' howl duration is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add the lengths of their howls together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12. The total amount of money Adam received from his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

The cost of the trousers is $30. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

$30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"To find the age of Wilfred, we can use the information given in the problem. Let's denote Helene's age as H and Wilfred's age as W.

We know the total age of the children is 20, and the average age is 5. Since Helene is twice the average age, we can set up the equation:

H = 2 * 5
H = 10

We also know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro, which are 3 and 4, respectively. The sum of their ages is 3 + 4 = 7. To find Wilfred's age, we can subtract the sum of Akbar's and Alessandro's ages from the total age:

W = 20 - 7
W = 13

The age of Wilfred is 13."
"As a financial analyst, I can help Walter determine the amount his lawyer will contribute.

To calculate the total amount collected, we need to add the money Walter collected from his neighbors ($500) and the online fund ($1500). This gives us a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.

However, Walter's lawyer will contribute three times as much as everyone else donates. Since Walter has already collected $2000, his lawyer will contribute 3 * $2000 = $6000.

But, Walter's friend is going to give him $200, which will be subtracted from the total amount collected. So, the final amount Walter's lawyer will contribute is $6000 - $200 = $5800.

The final answer is: $5800"
"To determine the number of people in the church, we need to calculate the total number of cookies given to the church and then divide that by the number of cookies each person received.

The bride gave half of the total cookies to the church, which is 1/2 of 1500 cookies. 

Number of cookies given to the church = 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies

Since each person in the church received 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church by 15 to find the number of people in the church.

Number of people in the church = 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

The final answer is 50."
"To divide a watermelon among a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) such that each adult gets a slice twice as big as that of each kid, we can use the concept of proportional division.

Let's assume the number of slices for the kids is x. Then, the number of slices for the adults is 2x. Since the total number of slices is 6, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 6

Combine like terms: 3x = 6

Divide both sides by 3: x = 2

So, the number of slices for the kids is 2, and the number of slices for the adults is 2x = 4.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we can divide the number of slices for the adults (4) by the total number of slices (6) and multiply by 100:

(4/6) * 100 = 66.67%

Therefore, each adult gets approximately 66.67% of the watermelon.

The final answer is 66.67."
"As a medical professional with expertise in scheduling and time management, I can help Doctor Jones optimize his schedule.

To determine the time left for updating records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments. 

Time spent on inpatient rounds: 9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes
Time spent on appointments: 10 appointments * 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Total time spent: 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Converting the total time to hours: 480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours

Now, we subtract the total time spent from the total hours available: 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour

Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to consider the total time required to complete the process. 

The total time is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, bake the cake, cool the cake, and frost the cake. 

Time to make the cake batter: 20 minutes
Time to bake the cake: 30 minutes
Time to cool the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time to frost the cake: 10 minutes

Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

Converting the total time to hours and minutes, we get 3 hours.

Now, we subtract the total time from the serving time to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm.

Final answer: 2:00 pm"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can use a simple division problem. Since Lisa and Peter sold a total of 64 chocolate bars and they sold 8 boxes together, we can divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as 'x'. We can set up the equation:

3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Combine like terms:

8x = 64

Divide both sides by 8:

x = 64 / 8

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

Final answer: 8"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the cost of renting the studio and the cost of the students' lessons.

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session, and it is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost of renting the studio is $25 * 3 = $75. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of renting the studio is $75 * 4 = $300.

The cost of renting the studio per student per session is $1.50, and there are 10 students. So, the weekly cost of students' lessons is $1.50 * 3 * 10 = $45. The monthly cost of students' lessons is $45 * 4 = $180.

The total cost of renting the studio and students' lessons per month is $300 (renting) + $180 (students' lessons) = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple division approach. Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x.

Since Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars in each, his total number of chocolate bars is 4x. We know that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 64

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 64 ÷ 4
x = 16

Now that we know the number of chocolate bars in each box (x = 16), we can find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each box of Peter and Martha. Martha has 7 boxes with 8 chocolate bars in each, so the difference is:

16 - 8 = 8

The final answer is: 8"
"To determine the total population of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to consider the initial population, the number of female porcupines, and the birth rate.

The initial population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, which is 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of new porcupines per month is 30 * 4 = 120.

In a year, there are 12 months, so the total number of new porcupines in a year is 120 * 12 = 1440.

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be the sum of the initial population and the new porcupines:
50 (initial population) + 1440 (new porcupines) = 1490.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1490}$"
"To calculate the volume of the pool, we'll use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length x width x height. In this case, the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.

Volume = Length x Width x Depth
Volume = 14 x 25 x 4
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Since the pool company needs to multiply the volume by 5.9 to calculate the total gallons of water needed, we'll do that next.

Total gallons = Volume x 5.9
Total gallons = 1400 x 5.9
Total gallons = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Total gallons x Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 x 0.10
Cost = $826

The cost to fill the pool is $826."

Let's break down the information given:

- Number of red sticks = 9
- Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14
- Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

To find the total number of sticks, we simply add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.

Total number of sticks = 9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

"To determine the difference in distance traveled between Matteo and Shandy, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed × Time

For Matteo, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
Distance = 220 miles

For Shandy, the distance traveled is:
Distance = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
Distance = 450 miles

Now, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance to find the difference:
Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
Difference = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To determine the total number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the information into two categories: students over 16 years old and students under 16 years old.

First, let's calculate the number of students over 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, we have 3000 / 2 = 1500 students in this category.

Now, we know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male. To find the number of male students over 16, we can calculate 1/4 of 1500, which is 1500 / 4 = 375.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which is also 1500 students. One-half of these students are male, so we calculate 1/2 of 1500, which is 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16.

To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16: 1500 - 375 = 1125.

To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16: 1500 - 750 = 750.

Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16: 1125 + 750 = 1875.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1875}$"
"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the difference between their lap counts.

First, we know that Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, we can express Trey's lap count as 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

Next, we find Shaelyn's lap count by dividing Trey's lap count by 2, which gives us 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

Lastly, we calculate Quinn's lap count by subtracting 2 from Shaelyn's lap count, resulting in 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Now, to find the difference between Bethany's and Quinn's lap counts, we subtract Quinn's lap count from Bethany's: 10 - 5 = 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine the remaining amount of water in the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

The total amount of water pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, the remaining amount of water is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6000}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential decay. The power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, and then loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.

Let's assume the initial charge of the power bank is x. After 5 hours, the charge remaining would be:

x - (9% * 5) = x - 0.45x = 0.55x

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour. So, after 3 hours, the charge remaining would be:

0.55x - (7% * 3) = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x

Since the charge remaining is 28%, we can set up an equation:

0.34x = 0.28

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 0.34:

x = 0.28 / 0.34
x = 0.82

To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

x = 0.82 * 100
x = 82%

The final answer is: 82"
"As a financial analyst specializing in personal savings and budgeting, I can help Janet determine how many weeks she needs to work to save for the down payment on her new car.

To calculate the total amount Janet needs to save, we need to find 20% of the car's cost. 

20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

Since Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

To find out how many hours she needs to work to save $2,000, we can divide the amount she needs to save by her hourly wage:

$2,000 / $25 = 80 hours

Since Janet works 40 hours a week, we can divide the total hours she needs to work by her weekly hours to find out how many weeks she needs to work:

80 hours / 40 hours/week = 2 weeks

Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The prices are as follows:
- Peaches: $0.50 each
- Pears: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches
- 4 pears
- 2 kiwis
- 5 apples

First, let's calculate the total amount spent on the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:
3 peaches * $0.50 = $1.50
4 pears * $0.75 = $3
2 kiwis * $1 = $2
5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Total amount spent so far = $1.50 + $3 + $2 + $3.75 = $10.25

Since Jamaar has spent more than he has, we need to recalculate the total amount he has left:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

However, since Jamaar can't spend a negative amount, we'll consider the initial calculation of the total amount spent on the fruits he has already purchased. We'll subtract this from his initial amount:
$10 - $10.25 = -$0.25

To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we'll divide the amount he has left by the price of a plum:
$0.25 ÷ $0.25 = 1

Jamaar can buy 1 plum.

Final answer: 1"
"To determine the number of pieces of sweets each friend received, we need to calculate the total number of pieces given away and then divide it by the number of friends.

First, we find the total number of pieces given away by subtracting the number of packs Anne kept from the total number of packs:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Since each pack has 60 pieces, we multiply the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack:

13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the total number of pieces given away by the number of friends:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces/friend

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.

The final answer is: 78"
"As a seasoned expert in mathematical modeling and analysis, I'd be delighted to help you calculate the price of carrots after three years, considering a 5% annual increase.

To calculate the price of carrots after three years, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = final price
P = initial price ($120)
r = annual increase rate (5% or 0.05)
n = number of years (3)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $120(1 + 0.05)^3
A = $120(1.05)^3
A = $120(1.157625)
A = $139.25

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $139.

Final answer: $139"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can divide 72 by 8 to get the number of pictures per album.

72 ÷ 8 = 9

Since 3 albums were selfies, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 3 by 9 to find the number of selfies.

3 x 9 = 27

Since 2 albums were portraits, and each album has 9 pictures, we can multiply 2 by 9 to find the number of portraits.

2 x 9 = 18

The total number of portraits and selfies is 27 + 18 = 45.

The final answer is: 45"
"To determine the total time James spends reading, we can use the concept of unit rates. We know that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

3 pages / 10 minutes = 18 pages / x minutes

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3x = 18 * 10
3x = 180
x = 180 / 3
x = 60

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the current number of guests at the hotel, we can break down the information step by step.

Initially, the hotel had 100 guests. Then, 24 guests checked out early, leaving 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

Next, 15 guests checked out late, resulting in 76 - 15 = 61 guests remaining.

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests checked out late, 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in. Therefore, the number of guests remaining is 61 + 30 = 91.

Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The hotel now has 98 guests."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday. Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. To find the total number of bananas John has, we need to add the bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

On Wednesday, John picked 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picked 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas

The total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions, we can break down the 60-question quiz as follows:

Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.4 * 60 = 24 questions
Average and difficult questions: The remaining 60 - 24 = 36 questions are divided equally between average and difficult, so each type has 36 / 2 = 18 questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, which is 24 * 0.75 = 18 questions.

She is also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions, which is 18 * 0.5 = 9 questions.

To find the total number of points Aries is sure to get, we add the points from easy and average/difficult questions:
18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36

The final answer is 36."
"Let's dive into the world of stuffed animals and pricing. As a seasoned expert in the field of retail analysis, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the prices of large and small stuffed animals. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we can represent the price of a large stuffed animal as 3x, where x is the price of a small stuffed animal.

Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we can determine the price of a large stuffed animal: 3x = 3 * 4 = $12.

Now, let's consider the sales data. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so if she sold 's' number of large stuffed animals, she sold 2s number of small stuffed animals. The total amount earned from the sales is $120, which gives us the equation: 12s + 4(2s) = 120.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 12s + 8s = 120
Combining like terms, we get: 20s = 120
Dividing both sides by 20, we get: s = 6

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2s = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten in a week, we can use the formula:

Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total sandwiches eaten per day by 7:

Total sandwiches eaten in a week = 11 * 7 = 77

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Let's break down Suzanne's earnings and expenses to determine how much money she has left.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80.
She sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240.

Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 x $10 = $20.

Now, we subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300.

Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"To determine the number of eggs the friends found, we can use a simple subtraction approach. 

First, we subtract the number of eggs found by the twins (30) from the total number of eggs (100). This leaves us with 70 eggs that are not yet accounted for.

Next, we subtract the 10 eggs that were not found from the remaining 70 eggs. This gives us:

70 - 10 = 60

Therefore, the friends found 60 eggs.

The final answer is: 60"
"To calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we need to consider the increased efficiency of the steel pickaxe.

We know that one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands. With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 24 * 1.5 = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Since there are 40 dwarves, the total amount of ore mined per day with steel pickaxes is 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds.

To find the total amount of ore mined in a month, we multiply this by 30 days: 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.

Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43200 pounds of ore in a month.

The final answer is: 43200"
"To determine the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the concept of proportionality. Since the prices of the first two packages are known, we can set up a proportion to find the price of the third package.

Let x be the price of the package with 8 sandwiches. We can set up the following proportion:

(2 sandwiches / $3) = (8 sandwiches / x)

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

2x = 8 * 3
2x = 24

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 24 / 2
x = 12

Therefore, the price of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

Final answer: $12"
"To calculate the monthly payment, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom owes after using the $1000 he received from selling his old bedroom. This can be done by subtracting the amount received from the initial cost of the bedroom set.

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling the old bedroom: $1000
Remaining amount owed: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Since Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount per month, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows:

Monthly payment = 10% of $2000
Monthly payment = 0.10 x $2000
Monthly payment = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set."
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons remaining after each event.

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst: 
40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

The number of red balloons remaining is 25 - 10 = 15.

Next, we calculate the number of yellow balloons released: 
Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.

The number of yellow balloons remaining is 12 - 6 = 6.

Then, we calculate the number of blue balloons added: 
75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

The total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 15 red balloons + 6 yellow balloons + 6 blue balloons = 27 balloons.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we can use the concept of complementary probability. The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events:

- The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 50% chance of a normal teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3
- The substitute teacher comes in: 50% chance of a substitute teacher, 60% chance of not getting an extension = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3

The probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework is 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6. To find the probability that he will have to turn in his homework, we subtract this value from 1: 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.4 * 100 = 40%

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 40%.

Final answer: $\boxed{40\%}$"
"To determine the number of tickets each graduate would receive, we need to calculate the remaining seats after accounting for the graduates and faculty.

Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center = 6000
Seats taken by graduates = 950
Seats taken by faculty = 300
Total seats taken = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now, subtract the total seats taken from the total capacity:
6000 - 1250 = 4750

Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates:
4750 ÷ 950 = 5

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To determine the number of small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish a relationship between the different sizes of jelly beans. We know that it takes 75 large beans to fill him up, and he can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans. This can be represented as:

Medium beans = 2 * Large beans
Medium beans = 2 * 75
Medium beans = 150

Since eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean, we can set up a proportion to find the number of small beans:

Small beans = Medium beans / 3
Small beans = 150 / 3
Small beans = 50

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 50 small beans."
"As a juror compensation expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of Melissa's hourly wage after expenses.

To calculate Melissa's hourly wage, we need to first determine her total daily income and then subtract her parking expenses. 

Daily income: $15 per day
Parking expenses: $3 per day
Total daily income after expenses: $15 - $3 = $12 per day

Since Melissa works for 3 days, her total income after expenses is $12 * 3 = $36.

Now, let's calculate her hourly wage:
$36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour

The final answer is: $2"
"To calculate the total amount Ted spent, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Number of books * Price per book) + (Number of pencils * Price per pencil)

Given that Ted buys 3 books for 16 dollars each and 3 pencils for 6 dollars each, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Total Cost = (3 * 16) + (3 * 6)
Total Cost = 48 + 18

Therefore, Ted spent a total of 66 dollars.

66"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles he can fit in his driveway and then multiply that by the time it takes him to move from one bottle to the next.

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. To find the total number of bottles, we can divide the width of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per bottle = 8 bottles

Since Richard starts at the first bottle, he will have to move 7 times to reach the last bottle. It takes him 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next. So, the total time it will take him to set off all the soda fountains is:

7 moves * 5 seconds per move = 35 seconds

Therefore, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we need to multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes.

Number of apples in one box = 40
Number of boxes = 2

Total number of apples = 40 * 2 = 80

Since each pack has 8 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by 8 to find the number of packs.

Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: 10"
"To calculate the remaining amount of money Amor has to buy meat, we need to subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she bought 2 pounds, so the total cost of Parmesan cheese is 2 * $11 = $22.
The cost of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she bought 3 pounds, so the total cost of Mozzarella cheese is 3 * $6 = $18.

The total cost of cheese is $22 + $18 = $40.

Amor started with $50. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost of cheese from her initial amount:

$50 - $40 = $10

Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To calculate the total amount of money lost from not working while in school, we need to multiply the number of years in school by the annual income.

Number of years in school: 4 years
Annual income before college: $25,000
Annual income after college: $75,000 (triple the original income)

Total amount lost from not working: 4 years * $25,000 = $100,000

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:

Total amount of loans: 4 years * $50,000 = $200,000
Total amount to earn: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The comforter's dimensions are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. 

First, we need to find the dimensions of the comforter:
- Length: 6 + 2 = 8 feet
- Width: 8 + 2 = 10 feet

Now, we can calculate the area of the comforter:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 8 x 10
Area = 80 square feet

Since the comforter is made of two pieces, we need to multiply the area by 2:
Total fabric needed = 2 x 80
Total fabric needed = 160 square feet

The final answer is: $\boxed{160}$"
"To calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. To find one-fifth of Monday's delivery, we can divide 425 by 5:
425 ÷ 5 = 85

Then, we add 17 to this result:
85 + 17 = 102

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's delivery. To find twice Tuesday's delivery, we multiply 102 by 2:
2 * 102 = 204

Then, we add 5 to this result:
204 + 5 = 209

Now, let's add the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

"To calculate the average amount lost, we need to consider the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

In the first race, Johnny lost $5.
In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
So, he won $2 * $5 + $1 = $11.
In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 
So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Total amount lost = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Average amount lost = Total amount lost / Number of races
= $21.5 / 3
= $7.17

The final answer is $7.17."

We can set up the equation based on the given information:

x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920

Combine like terms:

3x + 160 = 1920

Subtract 160 from both sides:

3x = 1760

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 1760 / 3
x = 586.67

So the first person took $586.67.

"To calculate the total hours worked by the team, we need to consider the fractional part of a day and convert it into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply 3/8 by 24 to find the equivalent hours.

3/8 * 24 = 9 hours

Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we multiply the hours worked per day by the number of days:

9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

Now, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters (4) to find the hours worked per painter:

"Let's dive into the world of tennis ball retrieval. As a tennis enthusiast, I'll break down the problem step by step.

We're given that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

The final answer is: 10"
"To calculate the price of the car in 2010, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

"As a financial analyst specializing in insurance pricing, I can help James determine his increased monthly insurance cost after an accident.

Given that the normal cost is $120 per month, and the accident resulted in a 60% increase, we can calculate the new monthly cost as follows:

New monthly cost = Normal cost + (60% of normal cost)
= $120 + (0.6 x $120)
= $120 + $72
= $192

To find the yearly cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

Yearly cost = New monthly cost x 12

"To determine the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the number of loads for each type of bed and then add them together.

Since the laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week as follows:

Twin loads per week: 4 beds * 52 weeks = 208 twin loads
King loads per week: 1 bed * 52 weeks = 52 king loads

To find the total number of loads per week, we divide the total number of loads by 3 (2 twin sets + 1 king set):

Total loads per week = (208 twin loads + 52 king loads) / 3
Total loads per week = (208 + 52) / 3
Total loads per week = 260 / 3
Total loads per week = 86.67 (round up to 87 since you can't do a fraction of a load)

Now, multiply the total loads per week by 52 weeks to find the total number of loads per year:

Total loads per year = 87 * 52
Total loads per year = 4524

"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the given information. Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as x. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can express Becky's slices as x + 3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so we can express Silvia's slices as 2x.

We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation:
x + 3 = 10

Solving for x, we get:
x = 10 - 3
x = 7

Now that we know Jake ate 7 slices, we can find Silvia's slices:
Silvia's slices = 2x
Silvia's slices = 2 * 7
Silvia's slices = 14

To find the total number of slices they ate, we can add the slices each person ate:
Total slices = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices = (x + 3) + x + 2x
Total slices = 4x + 3
Total slices = 4(7) + 3
Total slices = 28 + 3
Total slices = 31

The final answer is: 31"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic methods to find the time taken by Betsy and Donovan. Let's denote Donovan's part as x. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part can be represented as x + 18.

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Since Betsy's part is x + 18, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to x:

Betsy's part = 40 + 18
Betsy's part = 58

The final answer is 58."
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider the various expenses incurred. 

First, we'll calculate the cost of the cast, which is a fixed amount of $200. 

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the visit. The doctor charges $300 per hour, and the visit lasted for 0.5 hours (since it was 30 minutes). So, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.

The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills. Therefore, the cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.

Lastly, the doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, and the minimum required parking time is 2 hours. So, the cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the costs together: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"To calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to first find the number of emails that require a response. 

James receives 80 emails per day, and 20% of those emails don't require a response. This means 80 - (20% of 80) = 80 - 0.2 * 80 = 80 - 16 = 64 emails require a response.

Since James responds to 64 emails per day, he responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails in a 5-day work week.

The final answer is 320."
"To calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center, we can use the following steps:

Let's start by identifying the number of classes that visited each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 2 * 32 = 64 classes
- Wednesday: 3 * 32 = 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we can add up the number of classes that visited each day to find the total:

32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The final answer is: $\boxed{247}$"
"To calculate the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. In this case, John's scores are 100, 100, 100, and 80.

The sum of these scores is 380. To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of tests, which is 4.

Average score = Sum of scores / Number of tests
= 380 / 4
= 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team.

The glee club ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is 0.7 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas.

In total, the glee club and the football team ate 14 + 32 = 46 pizzas.

The total number of pizzas ordered was 20 + 40 = 60 pizzas.

So, the number of pizzas left is 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
"As a postal analyst, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with mailing coupons.

To calculate the total cost of postage, we need to consider the number of small and big coupons being sent. Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which is 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The total number of coupons is 700 + 1400 = 2100.

The cost of mailing small coupons is 700 * 5 cents = $7.00.
The cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 * 15 cents = $21.00.

The total cost of postage is $7.00 + $21.00 = $28.00.

The final answer is: $28."
"To determine the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is 7 * 4 = 28.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 3 sub sandwiches is 3 * 4 = 12.

Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, bringing the total number of sub sandwiches to 3 (remaining) + 3 (new) = 6 sub sandwiches. The total number of meatballs in these 6 sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24.

The final answer is: $\boxed{24}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Two hours after the trucks departed, it was discovered that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertiliser.

To find the number of trucks that could not deliver, we can calculate a quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched:

Number of trucks that could not deliver = 1/4 * 20
= 5

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that could not be delivered is:

5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons

Now, we need to find the total amount of fertiliser that was delivered. We know that 5 trucks could not deliver, so the number of trucks that delivered is:

20 - 5 = 15

The total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
15 trucks * 20 tons = 300 tons

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the butter, we need to determine the number of pounds Dennis needs and apply the discount.

Dennis requires 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen. Therefore, he needs 6 x 1 = 6 pounds of butter.

The grocery store offers a promotion where you buy one pound of butter and get one half off. This means that for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis will pay for 1.5 pounds. To find the total cost, we can divide the total amount of butter needed (6 pounds) into groups of 2 pounds.

6 pounds / 2 pounds per group = 3 groups

Since each group costs 1.5 pounds, the total cost will be:
3 groups x 1.5 pounds per group = 4.5 pounds

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. To find the total cost, we multiply the total pounds by the cost per pound:
4.5 pounds x $4.00 per pound = $18.00

The final answer is: $18.00"
"To calculate the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to consider the base rental fee and the additional guests. The base fee is $125 for a party of 20 guests. Since the number of guests exceeds 20, we need to calculate the cost for the additional guests.

Number of additional guests = Total number of guests - 20
= 41 - 20
= 21

Cost for additional guests = Number of additional guests * $6
= 21 * $6
= $126

Total cost = Base fee + Cost for additional guests
= $125 + $126
= $251

The final answer is: $251"
"Let's dive into the problem. Maggie and Riza's spending habits can be analyzed using the concept of fractions. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money, we can represent this as 1/4. Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which can be represented as 1/3.

To find the initial amount of money they had, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the initial amount as x. Since they each had $60, we can write the equation:

(1/4)x + (1/3)x = 60

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions:

3x + 4x = 720

Combine like terms:

7x = 720

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 720/7
x = 102.86 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a dollar, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, for the sake of precision, we'll keep the exact value.

Now that we know the initial amount, we can find the total amount spent:

Maggie spent 1/4 of $102.86:
(1/4) * 102.86 = 25.71

Riza spent 1/3 of $102.86:
(1/3) * 102.86 = 34.26

The total amount spent is 25.71 + 34.26 = 60

To find the amount left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:
102.86 - 60 = 42.86

The two of them have $42.86 left.

The final answer is $42.86."
"To determine the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day. 

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
10 * 7 = 70 bananas
14 * 7 = 98 bananas

The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 70 + 98 = 168 bananas.

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is:
315 - 168 = 147 bananas

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey by 7:
147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas per day.

The final answer is 21."
"To calculate the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to consider the number of pieces he completed in the first half of the puzzle and the number of pieces he completed in the second puzzle.

Since Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, he placed 250 pieces.

In the second puzzle, he finished 500 pieces.

The total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750.

Final answer: 750"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny wants to buy 15 roses. Roses cost $2 each, and a dozen (12) roses cost $15. We can calculate the cost of 15 roses in two ways:

1. 15 roses * $2 per rose = $30
2. 1.25 dozen * $15 per dozen = $18.75

Since we know that 1.25 dozen is equivalent to 15 roses, we can use either method to calculate the cost. Let's use the second method for consistency.

Now, let's calculate the change Jenny will receive:

Jenny pays with 5 $5 bills, which is a total of $25. The cost of the roses is $18.75. To find the change, we subtract the cost from the amount she paid:

$25 - $18.75 = $6.25

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so we can divide the change by 4:

$6.25 ÷ 4 = 1.5625

Since we can't give a fraction of a quarter, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can give 1 quarter (0.25) and 1 dollar in change.

Jenny will receive 1 quarter and 1 dollar in change.

Final Answer: The number of quarters Jenny will leave with is 1."
"As a financial analyst specializing in retail sales, I can break down the problem into individual components to calculate the total revenue.

Let's calculate the total sales for each item:

Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 = $33
Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 = $99
Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 = $30

To find the total revenue, we add these amounts together:

$33 + $99 + $30 = $162

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.

The final answer is: $162"
"To determine the total waiting time for Paul, we need to analyze the train schedule. 

The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The time between the first train's arrival and departure is 20 minutes.

The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 minutes after the first train's arrival. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes. So, the time between the second train's arrival and departure is 5 minutes.

The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 minutes after the second train's arrival. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so the time between the third train's arrival and departure is 0 minutes.

The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 20 minutes after the third train's arrival. This is the train Paul will board.

Now, let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for the first train + Waiting for the second train + Waiting for the third train + Waiting for the fourth train
= 20 + 30 + 60 + 20
= 130 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$"
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we need to calculate the number of toothpicks she still needs to save. 

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks, which is a total of 120 toothpicks. Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has saved from the total number of toothpicks required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Now, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves per week (10) to find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the sale price, then divide by the original price and multiply by 100.

The original price of the watch is 2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, so the sale price is 0.75 * 2000 = 1500.

Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, which is 1.2 * 1500 = 1800.

The discount is 2000 - 1800 = 200. To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: (200 / 2000) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%.

The final answer is 10."
"As a marine biologist specializing in the study of jellyfish, I can provide a precise calculation for the number of jellyfish created by multiple springs.

To determine the total number of jellyfish created, we need to consider the rate of jellyfish creation per hour by one spring and then multiply it by the number of springs and the number of hours.

Since a new jellyfish is created every second, we can assume that the rate of jellyfish creation is 1 jellyfish per second. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, and 4 hours in the given time frame.

The number of jellyfish created per hour by one spring is 1 jellyfish/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 jellyfish/hour.

If 5 springs are working at the same rate, the total number of jellyfish created per hour is 5 * 3600 jellyfish/hour = 18,000 jellyfish/hour.

In 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created is 18,000 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72000}$"
"To determine Frankie's score, we can use the given information that his score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score. We know Binkie's score is 90.

Let's represent Frankie's score as F and Binkie's score as B. We can set up the equation:

F = 2B + 15

Substituting B = 90 into the equation, we get:

F = 2(90) + 15
F = 180 + 15
F = 195

Therefore, Frankie's score is 195."
"To calculate the total time it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

The total distance James walked is 4 miles (2 miles to the store and 2 miles back home). 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time = 1 hour

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store.

"To determine the cost-effectiveness of buying bananas in bunches versus individually, we need to consider the total cost of purchasing 10 bunches of bananas.

The cost of buying 10 bunches individually is calculated as follows:

10 bunches * $0.80 per bunch = $8.00

On the other hand, buying 10 bunches at a discounted rate of $3.00 per bunch results in a total cost of:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

$8.00 - $30.00 = -$22.00

Since the result is negative, it means Jenny actually spent more money by buying in bunches instead of individually. However, if we want to find out how much she saved, we can take the absolute value of the result:

$22.00

The final answer is: $22.00"
"To determine the amount of fence left over for Sam, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as x. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share can be represented as x + 60.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

Now that we know Sam gets 20 feet of fence, we can find the amount left over for Sam by subtracting his share from the total length of the fence:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is 80 feet.

The final answer is: 80"
"To calculate the total growth of the crocodile in 13 years, we can use the formula for linear growth:

Total growth = growth rate * number of years

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, the growth rate is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year.

Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is: $\boxed{26}$"
"As a bicycle enthusiast and owner of a bicycle store, I can provide a detailed analysis of the situation.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The price of one MTB is $500, and the price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
2. The total number of bikes sold is 300, with 150 being Trekking bikes (50% of the total) and 45 being BMX bikes (15% of the total).
3. The remaining bikes are MTB, which is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105 bikes.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 * $450 = $67,500
Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 * $250 = $11,250
Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 * $500 = $52,500

Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

The final answer is: $131,250"
"As a farm management specialist, I can analyze the situation and provide a detailed breakdown of the hay production and harvesting process.

The farmer's hourly production rate is 5 bales per hour, and the truck's hourly pickup rate is 3 bales per hour. To determine the total number of bales left in the field after 6 hours, we need to calculate the net change in bale quantity.

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the total production is 5 * 6 = 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, so in 6 hours, the total pickup is 3 * 6 = 18 bales.

To find the net change in bale quantity, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales produced: 30 - 18 = 12 bales.

Therefore, 12 bales of hay are left in the field.

12"
"To calculate the total hours John spends learning per week, we need to consider his class schedule and additional learning time.

First, we calculate the total minutes he spends in class per week. He attends 5 classes per day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total minutes he spends in class per day is 5 * 40 = 200 minutes.

Since he attends classes for 5 days a week, the total minutes he spends in class per week is 200 * 5 = 1000 minutes.

Next, we need to add the extra minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on these two days. 

1/16 of 1000 minutes is 1000 / 16 = 62.5 minutes.

So, the total minutes he spends on learning per week is 1000 + 62.5 = 1062.5 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60.

1062.5 / 60 = 17.6875 hours.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17.6875}$"
"To determine the height of the ball on its second bounce, we can apply the concept of exponential decay. Since the ball bounces to 2/3 of its previous height with each bounce, we can model this situation using the formula:

h_n = h_0 * (2/3)^n

where h_n is the height after the nth bounce, h_0 is the initial height, and n is the number of bounces.

Given that the initial height is 3 stories, which is 72 feet, we can calculate the height after the second bounce as follows:

h_2 = 72 * (2/3)^2
h_2 = 72 * (4/9)
h_2 = 32

Therefore, the ball will go 32 feet on its second bounce.

32"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we can follow a step-by-step approach.

First, we know the height of the first child is 6 feet, which is equivalent to 72 inches. 

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{72}$"
"To calculate the total earnings, we can use the formula:

Total Earnings = Number of Bags Sold * Price per Bag

Given that the orchard sold 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples, we can calculate the number of bags sold as follows:

Number of Bags Sold = Total Apples Sold / Apples per Bag
= 2000 / 10
= 200 bags

Now, we can multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag to find the total earnings:

Total Earnings = Number of Bags Sold * Price per Bag
= 200 bags * $5 per bag
= $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000."
"As a paleontologist specializing in Mesozoic-era dinosaurs, I can provide a detailed analysis of the scenario.

To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to work backwards. Let's denote the initial amount of meat as 'x'. The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex (T-Rex) ate, which means the T-Rex ate x/2 kilograms. Then, the velociraptors ate x/4 kilograms (half of x/2). Finally, the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms.

We can set up the equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 4: x = 1080

Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

Final answer: 1080"
"To calculate the total area to be painted, we need to find the area of each wall and add them together.

The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of them, their total area is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.

The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

The cost of the paint is 12 gallons x $12 per gallon = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"To calculate the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the number of shaken cans and the total number of cans available.

Initially, there were 12 sodas, 3 of which were shaken. After Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, there were 11 sodas left. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 8 sodas. Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 5 unshaken sodas.

The friend can choose from the remaining 7 cans (2 shaken + 5 unshaken). The probability of the friend getting a shaken can is the number of shaken cans divided by the total number of cans, which is 2/7.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

(2/7) * 100 = 28.57%

The final answer is 28.57."
"When two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, their relative motion can be analyzed using the concept of relative velocity. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we can add their velocities to find the total relative velocity.

Let's denote the velocity of the first train as v1 = 60 miles per hour and the velocity of the second train as v2 = 30 miles per hour. The relative velocity (v_rel) is the sum of their velocities:
v_rel = v1 + v2 = 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = v_rel * 3
Distance = 90 * 3
Distance = 270 miles

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

The final answer is: $\boxed{270}$"
"To calculate the total number of people Billy can help, we need to determine the number of days he is available to volunteer and then multiply it by the number of people he can help per day.

There are 31 days in March. Billy takes 20% of the days off, which is 0.2 * 31 = 6.2 days. Since you can't take a fraction of a day off, we'll round down to 6 days.

So, Billy is available to help for 31 - 6 = 25 days.

He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Now, we multiply the number of days he is available to help (25) by the number of people he can help per day (6):

25 * 6 = 150

Therefore, Billy can help 150 people.

Final answer: 150"
"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people in the buses and the total number of people in the cars.

The number of people in buses can be calculated by multiplying the number of buses by the number of people each bus can carry. In this case, there are 12 buses, and each bus can carry 35 people.

Number of people in buses = 12 * 35
= 420

Similarly, the number of people in cars can be calculated by multiplying the number of cars by the number of people each car can carry. There are 20 cars, and each car can carry 3 people.

Number of people in cars = 20 * 3
= 60

The total number of people inside the church is the sum of the number of people in buses and the number of people in cars.

Total number of people = Number of people in buses + Number of people in cars
= 420 + 60
= 480

The final answer is: $\boxed{480}$"
"To determine Jeff's age, we can use the information provided about the age difference between Martha and Mike. Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, and Mike is 24 years old, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:

Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Now, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To find Jeff's age, we can add 10 to Martha's age:

Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
Jeff's age = 20 + 10
Jeff's age = 30

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"As a waterpark enthusiast and a blue-loving individual, I'm excited to dive into this problem. Given the information, we can calculate the time it takes to ride each slide.

The time it takes to ride the biggest slide is 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes. 

The time it takes to ride the second biggest slide is 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

To find the difference in time, we subtract the time for the second biggest slide from the time for the biggest slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the biggest waterslide takes 2 minutes longer than the second biggest slide.

Final answer: 2"
"As a time management specialist, I can analyze Bobby's daily routine to determine the total time spent on his lunch and breaks.

Bobby's daily routine consists of a 30-minute lunch and 2 x 15-minute breaks, which equals a total of 60 minutes per day. To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60:

60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour

Since Bobby takes this amount of time per day for 5 days, we can multiply the total time per day by 5:

1 hour * 5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over a 5-day period.

The final answer is: 5"
"To find the distance run by Ahito, we can use the information given about the total distance run by the three individuals and the distances run by Amber and Micah.

Let's denote the distance run by Ahito as A. We know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles, and Amber ran 8 miles. We also know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, which is 8 * 3.5 = 28 miles.

We can set up an equation to represent the total distance run by all three:

A + 8 + 28 = 52

Combine like terms:

A + 36 = 52

Subtract 36 from both sides:

A = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{16}$"
"To calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to consider the items she purchased after returning the $15.00 item.

The original charge was $85.00. After returning the item, the new balance is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Sheila then purchased a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. The discount amount is 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00. The price after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Additionally, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. The discount amount is 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00. The price after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $70.00 (previous balance) + $43.00 (new purchases) = $113.00.

The final answer is: $113.00"
"Let's dive into the world of jellyfish and solve this problem.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The remaining jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as x. The number of large jellyfish that change color is a third of the total number of large jellyfish, which is (1/3)(x/5) = x/15. Since 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

Final answer: 90"
"To determine Caroline's age, we can use the given information:

Let's denote Chris's age as C, Ben's age as B, and Caroline's age as A. We know that:

1. C = 4 (Chris is 4 years old)
2. B = 2C (Ben is two times older than Chris)
3. A = 3B (Caroline is three times older than Ben)

We can substitute the value of B from equation (2) into equation (3) to find A:

A = 3(2C)
A = 3(2 * 4)
A = 3 * 8
A = 24

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old.

"I'd be happy to help you with the problem. As a financial expert, I'll provide a clear and concise solution.

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for her retirement. Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary, she will spend $40,000 per year. If she saves 20% of her income, she will save $20,000 per year.

However, the question seems to have an error, as saving 20% of her income would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context. Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her expenses, not income.

If Lauren saves 20% of her expenses, her annual savings would be $20,000. Since she spends $40,000 per year, she actually spends more than she saves. This means she's not saving enough to cover her expenses.

To determine how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement, we need to know how much she needs to save. Assuming she wants to save a certain amount for retirement, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work.

Let's assume she wants to save $X for retirement. Since she saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

X / $20,000 = number of years

However, we don't know the exact amount she wants to save for retirement. To provide a more accurate answer, we need more information.

If we assume she wants to save a certain percentage of her income, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work. Let's assume she wants to save 20% of her income.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year

Since she spends $40,000 per year, she needs to save $20,000 per year to break even. However, this is still a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Let's assume the question meant to say she saves 20% of her expenses, not income.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000 per year

Since she spends $40,000 per year, she actually spends more than she saves. This means she's not saving enough to cover her expenses.

To determine how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement, we need to know how much she needs to save. Assuming she wants to save a certain amount for retirement, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work.

Let's assume she wants to save $X for retirement. Since she saves $20,000 per year, she needs to work for:

X / $20,000 = number of years

However, we don't know the exact amount she wants to save for retirement. To provide a more accurate answer, we need more information.

Since we can't determine the exact amount she wants to save for retirement, we can't provide a specific number of years she needs to work. However, we can provide a general guideline.

If she saves 20% of her expenses, she needs to work for at least 2 years to save $40,000 (2 * $20,000). However, this is still a rough estimate, and the actual number of years she needs to work may be different.

The correct answer cannot be determined without more information.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$"
"To determine the length of each final cut, we can apply the concept of division. We start by dividing the total length of the ribbon (100 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be cut into (4). This can be represented as:

100 cm ÷ 4 = 25 cm per part

Next, we divide the length of each part (25 cm) by the number of equal parts it will be divided into (5). This can be represented as:

25 cm ÷ 5 = 5 cm per final cut

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 cm long.

"To determine the total number of girls in the school, we can use the given information that 40% of the school population is made up of boys, and there are 240 boys. 

Let's denote the total number of students as x. Since 40% of the students are boys, we can set up the equation:

0.4x = 240

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.4:

x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

Now that we know the total number of students, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

Therefore, the total number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is: 360"

"To determine the number of miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time, we can divide the total number of miles she wants to hike (9,300) by the number of days in June (30).

9,300 miles / 30 days = 310 miles per day

Since Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles per day, we need to subtract this from the required daily amount to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day.

310 miles per day - 125 miles per day = 185 miles per day

So, Soledad needs to hike 185 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final answer: 185"

"To determine the cost of each book, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the cost of each book as 'x'. Since Anna bought 2 books, the total cost of the books is 2x. We know that the total amount she had initially was $16, and she spent $4 initially, leaving her with $12. After buying the books, she had $2 left. This means the total cost of the books is $12. 

We can set up the equation: 2x = 12

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 12 / 2
x = 6

So, each book cost $6.

"To calculate the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

New value = Old value + (Old value * Percentage increase)

In this case, the old value is 50 students, and the percentage increase is 20%. We can plug these values into the formula:

New value = 50 + (50 * 0.20)
New value = 50 + 10
New value = 60

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

The final answer is 60."
"To determine the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times, we can use the concept of rate and proportion. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can set up a proportion to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

Let x be the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. We can set up the proportion as follows:

255 blinks / 5 minutes = 459 blinks / x minutes

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

255x = 459 * 5

255x = 2295

Now, we can divide both sides by 255:

x = 2295 / 255

x = 9.00 minutes

Therefore, it will take the light approximately 9.00 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To calculate the total time, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. This is a straightforward task, and I can confidently say that 4 hours is a reasonable amount of time for lawn mowing.

Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. This implies that Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry.

Now, let's add up the time each person took to complete their chores:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 8 (Dior) = 18 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.

"To determine the distance Brian will walk in 7 days, we can use the information that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian. 

Let's denote the distance Brian walks in 7 days as x. Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian, the distance Sofie walks in 7 days is 2x. We know that Sofie walks 10 miles every day, so in 7 days, she walks 10 * 7 = 70 miles. 

We can set up the equation 2x = 70 to represent the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian. Solving for x, we get x = 70 / 2 = 35 miles.

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35}$"
"To determine the production rate of the fifth worker, we need to analyze the production capacity of the first four workers and the total number of toys required to fulfill the order.

Let's denote the production rate of the fifth worker as x toys per hour. The total production capacity of the first four workers is 2 * 6 + 2 * 4 = 20 toys per hour. Since the order requires 400 toys, and the first four workers produce 200 toys, the fifth worker must produce 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we can divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker (200) by the number of hours worked (10):

x = 200 / 10
x = 20 toys per hour

"To determine the number of small bags John can make, we need to calculate the total number of M&M's and then divide it by the number of M&M's per small bag.

Since John buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each, the total weight of M&M's is:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Given that an ounce of M&M contains 30 M&M's, the total number of M&M's is:

30 ounces * 30 M&M's/ounce = 900 M&M's

Now, we divide the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag (10) to find the number of small bags:

Number of small bags = Total M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag
= 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's/bag

= 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

The final answer is 50."
"As a speed enthusiast, I can provide a detailed analysis of the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the average car's speed is 120 mph. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we can calculate its speed as follows:

Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 × Average car speed
= 5 × 120 mph
= 600 mph

Now, we are told that the faster car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. To find the speed of the faster car, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:

Speed of faster car = 1.25 × Speed of 2nd fastest car
= 1.25 × 600 mph
= 750 mph

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 mph.

The final answer is: $\boxed{750}$"
"To find Vince's current age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote Vince's current age as 'V'. Two years ago, Vince's age was 'V - 2'. According to the problem, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago. We know Liam is 16 now, so 2 years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. We can set up the equation:

14 = 2 * (V - 2)

To solve for V, we can start by dividing both sides by 2:

7 = V - 2

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate V:

V = 7 + 2
V = 9

Therefore, Vince's current age is 9.

The final answer is 9."
"Let's dive into the world of egg-cellent math problems.

We have four friends - Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah - who painted a total of 56 Easter eggs. We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as A and the number of eggs Madeline painted as M. Since A = M, we can simplify our equations.

We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as S. Then, we can express Camden's eggs as C = S + 12.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs painted: A + M + C + S = 56. Since A = M, we can substitute A with M, giving us M + M + C + S = 56. Simplifying this, we get 2M + C + S = 56.

Substituting C = S + 12 into the equation, we get 2M + (S + 12) + S = 56. Combining like terms, we have 2M + 2S + 12 = 56.

Now, let's solve for S. Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get 2M + 2S = 44. Dividing both sides by 2, we get M + S = 22.

We know that C = S + 12, and we also know that C + S = 30. Substituting C = S + 12 into the equation C + S = 30, we get (S + 12) + S = 30. Simplifying this, we get 2S + 12 = 30.

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get 2S = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 9.

Now that we know S = 9, we can find C by substituting S into the equation C = S + 12, giving us C = 9 + 12 = 21.

Since A = M, we know that M = 13.

The final answer is: C - A = 21 - 13 = 8"
"Let's dive into the world of color and math. As a color enthusiast, I'm excited to tackle this problem.

To find the total weight of the crayons and boxes, we need to calculate the weight of the crayons and boxes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and Nik has 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

Weight of crayons = Total number of crayons * Weight of each crayon
= 200 * 1
= 200 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the weight of crayons to pounds:

Weight of crayons (in pounds) = Weight of crayons (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and Nik has 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:

Weight of boxes = Number of boxes * Weight of each box
= 25 * 8
= 200 ounces

Converting the weight of boxes to pounds:

Weight of boxes (in pounds) = Weight of boxes (in ounces) / 16
= 200 / 16
= 12.5 pounds

The total weight of the crayons and boxes is the sum of their individual weights:

Total weight = Weight of crayons + Weight of boxes
= 12.5 pounds + 12.5 pounds
= 25 pounds

"To calculate the total amount John makes from selling the planks, we need to consider the percentage of the tree that can be converted into logs and then into planks.

First, we find the total length of logs John can make: 80 feet * 0.8 = 64 feet. Since each log is 4 feet long, we divide the total length by the log length to get the number of logs: 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.

Next, we calculate the total number of planks by multiplying the number of logs by 5: 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.

Finally, we multiply the number of planks by the price per plank to find the total amount John makes: 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.

The final answer is: $96"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we need to calculate their combined salary.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of her brother's salary. Since her brother earns twice as much as Valerie, his salary is 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so her salary is 2 * ($5000 + $10,000) = 2 * $15,000 = $30,000 per month.

Now, let's add up their salaries: $5000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $40,000.

The total amount of money they all have together is $40,000."
"As a walking trail expert, I can analyze the situation and provide a solution.

Grandma's walking trail consists of 2 miles of beach walking and 1 mile of sidewalk walking. We know that she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Let's denote the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the beach as x minutes. Then, the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is 2x minutes.

We are given that 40 minutes are spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation:

x = 40 minutes / 2 miles

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20 minutes

Now, we can find the time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk:

2x = 2(20 minutes) = 40 minutes

Since the total walk is 3 miles, we can add the time it takes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk:

Total time = 20 minutes + 40 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"To determine the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60, we can use the concept of simple interest. Since she saves $4 per week, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Let x be the number of weeks it will take for Jane to save $60.

The total amount saved is the product of the weekly savings and the number of weeks:
4x = 60

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 60 ÷ 4
x = 15

Therefore, it will take Jane 15 weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: 15"
"The problem at hand involves calculating the total number of blue birds in a series of trees. To approach this, we can break it down into separate components and then sum them up.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. This can be represented as 3 * 7, which equals 21 blue birds.

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. This can be calculated as 2 * 4, resulting in 8 blue birds.

Lastly, there's 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

To find the total number of blue birds, we add these values together: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32.

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Bob has as 'x'. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 2 dozen is equal to 2 x 12 = 24. 

We can set up the equation: x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.

The final answer is 26."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of temperature and volume. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as x degrees.

Since Donny can drink the water after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug, the total amount of water he has is 5 ounces. The amount of water from the 33-degree mug is 4 ounces, and the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce.

We can set up an equation based on the fact that the total amount of water is 5 ounces:

4 ounces (from the 33-degree mug) + 1 ounce (from the other mug) = 5 ounces

However, this equation doesn't account for the temperature. Since Donny can drink the water, the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's assume the temperature of the other mug is x degrees. The amount of water in the other mug is 1 ounce, and the total amount of water is 5 ounces. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the total amount of water is 5 ounces:

1 ounce (from the other mug) + 4 ounces (from the 33-degree mug) = 5 ounces

Since the 33-degree mug is not the limiting factor, we can focus on the other mug. We know that the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water.

Let's analyze the situation: if the temperature of the other mug is less than 40 degrees, Donny won't be able to drink the water. Since the amount of water from the other mug is 1 ounce, the temperature of the other mug must be at least 40 degrees.

However, we can't determine the exact temperature of the other mug. We can only say that it must be at least 40 degrees.

Final answer: $\boxed{40}$"
"As an animal husbandry expert, I can provide a detailed analysis of the farm's growth.

The farm starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. To calculate the total number of animals after three weeks, we need to consider the daily and weekly growth.

Daily growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day

Weekly growth:
- Cows: 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows/week
- Chickens: 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens/week

Total growth in 3 weeks:
- Cows: 140 cows/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows
- Chickens: 70 chickens/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens

Total number of cows after 3 weeks: 50 (initial) + 420 (growth) = 470 cows
Total number of chickens after 3 weeks: 20 (initial) + 210 (growth) = 230 chickens

Total number of animals after 3 weeks: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The final answer is: $\boxed{700}$"
"As a bagel connoisseur, I can provide you with the most accurate calculation for the cost of each bagel.

To find the cost of each bagel, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels and then divide it by the total number of bagels. 

The total cost of 4 packs of bagels is 4 * $10.00 = $40.00.

Since Russell gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount. 
10% of $40.00 is 0.1 * $40.00 = $4.00.

The total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of each bagel. There are 9 bagels in each pack, so we divide the total cost by 9.
$36.00 / 9 = $4.00.

The final answer is: $4.00"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Let's start with the information that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

First, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. 
3 scoops - 1 scoop = 2 scoops
6 potatoes - 3 potatoes = 3 potatoes

Now, we know that 3 potatoes are needed for 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops.
3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop

Now, we know that 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 5 scoops, we multiply 1.5 potatoes by 5 scoops.
1.5 potatoes/scoop * 5 scoops = 7.5 potatoes

Since Gomer ate 5 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can now find out how many potatoes he ate.
7.5 potatoes - 5 scoops = 2.5 potatoes

The final answer is: $\boxed{2.5}$"
"To calculate the total number of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we can break it down into two parts: the eggs he eats in the first 30 days and the eggs he eats in the next 30 days.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Now, we add the total number of eggs from both periods: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find the number of dozens of eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 240 eggs / 12 = 20.

Therefore, Chester needs 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

The final answer is 20."
"Let's dive into the world of jellybean color distribution. As a color enthusiast, I'm excited to help Jess guess the number of blue jellybeans in the jar.

We know that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. This means the number of red jellybeans is 2 * 17 = 34.

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we need to subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. The total number of jellybeans is 60.

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
= 60 - (17 + 34)
= 60 - 51
= 9

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$"
"To calculate the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade, we can use the formula:

Total lemons = Number of trees * Number of lemons per tree * Number of years

Given:
Number of trees = 5
Number of lemons per tree = 6
Number of years = 10

Total lemons = 5 * 6 * 10
Total lemons = 300

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300."
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of ratios and proportions. The given ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14.

We are told that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can set up a proportion to find the value of one part: 5/14 = x/84, where x is the value of one part. Solving for x, we get x = 84/14 = 6.

Since the ratio of women is 9 parts, we multiply 9 by the value of one part: 9 * 6 = 54. This represents the initial number of women on the bus.

Now, we know that 20 women alighted from the bus. To find the number of women who remained, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women: 54 - 20 = 34.

The final answer is 34."
"As a floristry expert, I can break down the problem into two parts: the number of bouquets sold and the number of individual sunflowers sold.

First, let's calculate the total number of bouquets sold. Faraday earned $56 from the bouquet per day, and he sold it for 3 days. To find the total number of bouquets sold, we can divide the total earnings from bouquets ($56 * 3) by the cost of one bouquet ($8). 

Total earnings from bouquets = $56 * 3 = $168
Number of bouquets sold = Total earnings from bouquets / Cost of one bouquet = $168 / $8 = 21

Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold is 21 * 12 = 252.

The total number of sunflowers sold is 252.

Final answer: 252"
"To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to calculate the total cost of the rocks and the total revenue from selling 60% of the inventory.

Let's assume Adam buys x number of rocks. The cost of the rocks is $5x.

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, the number of rocks sold is 0.6x.

The revenue from selling 0.6x rocks at $7 each is 0.6x * 7 = $4.2x.

The total cost is $5x, and the total revenue is $4.2x. Since Adam invested all his money, the total revenue should be equal to the total cost.

However, this equation doesn't make sense, as the revenue is less than the cost. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

"To determine the total number of days required to complete the project, we need to calculate the time it takes to complete each type of picture scene and then add them together.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days
- Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days
- Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days

Since the days for each type of scene are not the same, we need to find the maximum number of days, which is 9 days.

The final answer is: 9"
"To determine the number of eggs each child receives, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. 

Three dozen eggs is equivalent to 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. 

Since there are 4 children, we can divide the total number of eggs by 4 to find the number of eggs each child receives.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

Therefore, each child will receive 9 eggs."
"To calculate the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to consider the daily cost of food per fish and the number of days in the month.

Since each fish requires $1 worth of food per day, and there are 31 days in May, we can multiply the daily cost by the number of days to find the total cost.

Total cost = Daily cost per fish * Number of days in May
Total cost = $1 * 31
Total cost = $31

Therefore, Jen spends $31 on food for her fish in May."
"To determine the total number of roses Patricia has now, we can use basic arithmetic operations. 

First, we need to subtract the number of roses she gave to her mother from the initial number of roses. This will give us the remaining roses after the gift. Then, we add the number of roses she bought to find the final total.

Initial number of roses = 30
Number of roses given to her mother = 24
Number of roses bought = 15

Total number of roses now = Initial number of roses - Number of roses given to her mother + Number of roses bought
= 30 - 24 + 15
= 21

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses.

Final answer: 21"
"To calculate the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

The formula for average speed is: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Given that Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and an additional 140 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the total distance and time as follows:

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can calculate the average speed:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
= 250 miles / 5 hours

Therefore, the average speed is 50 miles per hour."
"When calculating the probability of both tickets winning, we need to consider the joint probability of independent events. Since the outcome of one ticket does not affect the other, we can multiply their individual probabilities.

The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6.

To find the probability of both tickets winning, we multiply the probabilities: 0.2 * 0.6 = 0.12.

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 * 100 = 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12\%}$"
"Let's dive into the problem of distributing seashells among Carlos, Jim, and Carrey.

We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carlos collected as x. Then, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, we can set up another equation:

x = 2y

Substituting x = 22, we get:

22 = 2y

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

y = 11

Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can find the total number of seashells:

Total seashells = x + y + 27
= 22 + 11 + 27
= 60

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got:

Seashells per person = Total seashells / 3
= 60 / 3
= 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's break down Mason's carrot consumption into two parts: weekdays and weekends. 

On weekdays, Mason eats 4 carrots per day. Since there are 5 weekdays, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays can be calculated as:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On weekends, Mason eats 5 carrots per day. There are 2 weekend days, so the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends:

20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week."
"To calculate the total time of the cassette, we need to determine the length of the second song. Since the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we can calculate its length as follows:

Let's denote the length of the first song as x. The length of the second song is then x + 0.6x, which simplifies to 1.6x.

We know the length of the first song is 5 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

1.6x = 5

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.6:

x = 5 / 1.6
x = 3.125

Now that we know the length of the first song, we can find the length of the second song:

Length of the second song = 1.6x
= 1.6 * 3.125
= 5 + 3
= 8

The total time of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of both songs:

Total time = Length of the first song + Length of the second song
= 5 + 8
= 13 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
"As a financial analyst specializing in profit calculations, I'll break down the problem step by step.

To determine the total profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price.

Total cost = Cost of 2 devices bought on Monday + Cost of 4 devices bought on Tuesday
Total cost = 2 * $20 + 4 * $20
Total cost = $40 + $80
Total cost = $120

Total selling price = 2 * (2 * $20) + 4 * (2 * $20)
Total selling price = 2 * $40 + 4 * $40
Total selling price = $80 + $160
Total selling price = $240

Profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Profit = $240 - $120
Profit = $120

The final answer is: $120"
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we can analyze the given information step by step.

We know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can calculate Ned's height as 7 - 2 = 5 feet. Given that Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl's height can be calculated as 5 + 1 = 6 feet.

As Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle covers 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people is:

Total bottles needed = 2300 * 100% / 20%
Total bottles needed = 2300 * 5
Total bottles needed = 11500

Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day, we need to find out how many days it will take to produce 11500 bottles.

Number of days = Total bottles needed / Bottles produced per day
Number of days = 11500 / 4200
Number of days = 2.74

"To determine the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to consider the overlap between the groups.

Let's break it down:

Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 * 8 = 6
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 * 8 = 2
Number of babies wearing bows = 1/3 * (number of purple wearers) + (number of blue wearers)
= 1/3 * 6 + 2
= 2 + 2
= 4

Since 2 purple wearers also wear bows, we need to find the total number of babies wearing bows that are not purple. This is given by:
Number of babies wearing only blue bows = Number of blue wearers = 2

Now, we can find the total number of babies wearing bows that are purple:
Number of babies wearing purple bows = Number of purple wearers wearing bows - Number of babies wearing only blue bows
= 6 - 2
= 4

The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is then:
Probability = (number of purple bow wearers) / (total number of bow wearers)
= 4 / (4 + 2)
= 4 / 6
= 2/3
= 0.67
= 66.67%

The final answer is 66.67."
"To determine the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can use a simple subtraction approach. Let's break down the information:

Total reports received = 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136

We can start by finding the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. This will help us isolate the number of reports received on Wednesday.

Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Now, we can subtract this total from the overall total to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:

Reports received on Wednesday = Total reports received - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday
= 5168 - 4043
= 1125

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To calculate the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his unused land, we need to break down the problem step by step.

Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it for $50, which is 80 / 2 = $25 per square meter. Since he sold 40 square meters, the total amount he earned from this sale is 40 * $25 = $1000.

He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. Since he sold 20 square meters, the total amount he earned from this sale is 20 * $30 = $600.

Now, he has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters left. He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so he earned 20 * $3 = $60.

To find the total amount he earned, we add the amounts from each sale: $1000 + $600 + $60 = $1660.

The final answer is: $1660"
"To determine Geb's age, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's represent Haley's age as 'H' and Geb's age as 'G'. According to the problem, Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. This can be expressed as:

G = (1/2)H - 10

We are given that Haley is 26 years old, so we can substitute H = 26 into the equation:

G = (1/2)(26) - 10
G = 13 - 10
G = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

"To determine the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by each person and subtract that from the initial number of eggs.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

"To calculate John's weekly earnings, we need to first find the total number of apartments he collects garbage from. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so they have a combined total of 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it has 400 + (60% of 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, we can find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from: 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects garbage 3 times a week, the total number of collections per week is 1440 * 3 = 4320.

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are 4320 * 0.40 = $1728.

The final answer is: $1728"
"Avocado Tree Fruit Production Calculation

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to analyze the production pattern of the tree. The problem states that a 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.

Let's break down the production pattern:

Year 1: 50 fruits
Year 2: 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
Year 3: 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
Year 4: 7 * 150 = 1050 fruits
Year 5: 7 * 350 = 2450 fruits
Year 6: 7 * 1050 = 7350 fruits
Year 7: 7 * 2450 = 17150 fruits
Year 8: 10 * 17150 - 200 = 17100 fruits
Year 9: 0 fruits
Year 10: 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree in 10 years:
50 + 150 + 350 + 1050 + 2450 + 7350 + 17150 + 17100 + 0 + 1000 = 52500

"The problem at hand involves determining the length of the red rope, given that it is four times the length of the blue rope and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. We can approach this problem by setting up a system of equations.

Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as Y, the blue rope as B, and the red rope as R. We know that B = Y - 7 and R = 4B. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation Y + B + R = 37.

Substituting the expressions for B and R in terms of Y into the third equation, we get:
Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:
Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:
6Y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:
6Y = 72

Divide both sides by 6:
Y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
B = Y - 7
B = 12 - 7
B = 5

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
R = 4B
R = 4(5)
R = 20

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"Let's dive into the problem and break it down step by step.

We know that Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5. So, Rissa was given 3 * 5 = $15.

After giving an equal amount of money to her sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let's say she gave x dollars to her sister. Then, the amount of money she has left is 15 - x.

Since she is left with 4/5 of her money, we can set up the equation:

15 - x = (4/5) * 15

To solve for x, we can multiply 4/5 by 15:

15 - x = 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 - 12
x = 3

So, Rissa gave her sister $3. Now, we know that Rissa has 15 - 3 = $12 left.

Since Ronnie gave an equal amount of money to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3. Now, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:

Ronnie's initial money: $5
Ronnie gave her sister: $3
Ronnie's remaining money: $5 - $3 = $2

The final answer is: $2"
"To determine the amount of red paint used in the mural, we can start by recognizing that the mural is divided into four sections: red, white, purple, and yellow. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each of these colors as 'x'. Given that half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is also 'x'.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so we can set up the equation: x + x + x + x = 12

Combining like terms, we get 4x = 12

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 3

Since 'x' represents the amount of each color, the amount of red paint used is also 3 pints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total area of Tom's house, we need to determine the area of each room and add them together.

The area of one bedroom is 20 feet x 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the rooms together: 
240 + 1200 + 1000 = 2440 square feet.

The total area of the house is 2440 square feet.

Final answer: 2440"
"Cloud counting is a fascinating topic, and I'm delighted to dive into it. As a cloud enthusiast, I can assure you that the total number of clouds Alice counted can be calculated using a simple yet effective formula.

Let's break it down day by day:

On Monday, Alice counted 3 clouds.

On Tuesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Monday, which is 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she counted double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she counted double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she counted double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

To find the total number of clouds, we can add the number of clouds from each day:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 93.

The final answer is: $\boxed{93}$"
"To determine the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1, we need to calculate the cost per pod of the new box. 

The new box has 120 pods and costs $12. 
Cost per pod = Total cost / Total pods = $12 / 120 = $0.1 per pod.

Now, we can divide $1 by the cost per pod to find the number of cycles: 
$1 / $0.1 = 10 cycles.

Therefore, you can run 10 cycles for $1.

The final answer is: 10"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, resulting in 50 bills. He then loses 10 bills while getting home, leaving him with 40 bills. Half of the remaining bills are used to pay for a bill, which is 20 bills. After tripling his money, he now has 60 bills. Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.

To find the total number of 5 dollar bills, we multiply the total number of bills by 5. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$"
"To determine the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B. Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, so team A scores 1/4 * 2 = 0.5 goals in the second half.

Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Now, let's add up the goals scored by each team in both halves:
Team A: 4 (first half) + 0.5 (second half) = 4.5 goals
Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 4.5 + 10 = 14.5 goals.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14.5}$"
"To determine the number of days the teacher has before he needs to recycle the chalk, we can set up an equation based on the rate at which he uses the chalk.

Let's denote the total length of the chalk as L and the number of days as x. Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can express the remaining chalk after x days as:

L - 0.20x

We know that the teacher can't write with a piece of chalk smaller than 2 inches, so we can set up the following inequality:

L - 0.20x ≥ 2

We also know that the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is equivalent to 0.45L. Since he started with a 5-inch piece of chalk, we can set up the equation:

0.45L = 2.25

Solving for L, we get:

L = 2.25 / 0.45
L = 5

Now we can substitute L into the inequality:

5 - 0.20x ≥ 2

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

0.80x ≥ 3

Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get:

x ≥ 3.75

Since x represents the number of days, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the teacher will use up the remaining chalk in 4 days.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"
"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we need to calculate the total number of students on varsity and subtract that from the total number of students in the class.

The number of girls on varsity is one-third of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/3) = 4. Similarly, the number of boys on varsity is one-fourth of 12, which can be calculated as 12 * (1/4) = 3.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of girls and boys on varsity, which is 4 + 3 = 7.

The total number of students in the class is 12 + 12 = 24.

The number of students not on varsity can be found by subtracting the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class: 24 - 7 = 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{17}$"
"To determine the number of face masks Johnny bought, we need to calculate the number of face masks Mike bought first. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Then, we need to find thrice the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 3 * 5 = 15.

Since Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike, we add 2 to the result, which is 15 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To calculate the percentage of teeth fixed, we need to determine the total number of teeth fixed and the total number of teeth James has.

Number of teeth drilled = 4
Number of teeth capped = 7 + 4 = 11

Total number of teeth fixed = 4 + 11 = 15

Total number of teeth = 30

Percentage of teeth fixed = (15/30) * 100 = 50%

The dentist fixed 50% of James' teeth."
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to find 2/5 of the total gallons of milk purchased. 

The formula to find the amount of milk returned is: (2/5) * 4000

First, we multiply 2/5 by 4000: (2/5) * 4000 = (2 * 4000) / 5 = 8000 / 5 = 1600

Since Mr. Marcellus is returning 1600 gallons of milk, the cost of the returned milk would be:

1600 gallons * $3.5 per gallon = $5600

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the first statement, we know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:

W = 5(C + 7)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

W = 5C + 35

From the second statement, we know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:

C + 25 = (1/3)W

Substituting W = 5C + 35 into the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35)

Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtracting 3C from both sides, we get:

75 = 2C + 35

Subtracting 35 from both sides, we get:

40 = 2C

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

C = 20

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to calculate the total number of sets of 100 books he can purchase with $27,000.

First, we'll divide the total amount by the cost of one set of 100 books: $27,000 ÷ $500 = 54 sets.

Since Bob is distributing the books among 3 schools, we'll divide the total number of sets by the number of schools: 54 sets ÷ 3 schools = 18 sets per school.

Now, we'll multiply the number of sets per school by the number of books per set to find the total number of books per school: 18 sets per school × 100 books per set = 1800 books per school.

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1800}$"
"Let's analyze the situation step by step. We can model this problem using a simple iterative process.

Initially, Newton has 2 apples. 

1. He picks up 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws 1 into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 2 (initial) + 5 (new) = 7 apples.
2. He puts all but 1 apple in his pocket, so he has 7 - 1 = 6 apples left.
3. He throws 1 apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, he has 6 (previous) + 6 (new) = 12 apples.

Therefore, Newton brings home 12 apples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total cost of Ali's coal order, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = (Total Weight of Coal / Weight per Bag) * Cost per Bag

Given:
Total Weight of Coal = 850 kg
Weight per Bag = 50 kg
Cost per Bag = $18

Total Cost = (850 kg / 50 kg) * $18
= 17 * $18
= $306

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's coal order is $306."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can calculate the total number of slices required and divide it by the total number of slices per pizza.

Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, so the total number of slices each friend eats is 6 + 4 = 10 slices. Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.

The total number of slices per pizza is 12 (cheese) + 8 (pepperoni) = 20 slices. To find out how many pizzas Kate needs to buy, we can divide the total number of slices eaten (60) by the total number of slices per pizza (20).

60 ÷ 20 = 3

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 pizzas.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we can use the following formula:

Total miles = (Miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) + (Miles on Tuesday and Thursday)
Total miles = (3 miles * 3 days) + (5 miles * 2 days)
Total miles = 9 miles + 10 miles
Total miles = 19 miles

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{19}$"
"To determine the time it takes for Jay to build 60 snowballs, we need to consider the net rate at which he builds snowballs. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour but loses 2 every 15 minutes. 

First, let's calculate the number of snowballs lost per hour. Since there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, the total number of snowballs lost per hour is 2 * 4 = 8.

Now, we can find the net number of snowballs Jay builds per hour by subtracting the number lost from the number built: 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.

To find the time it takes to build 60 snowballs, we can divide the total number of snowballs by the net rate: 60 / 12 = 5 hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to build 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To determine Jim's age, we can use a simple division problem. Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can set up the equation:

John's age = 2 * Jim's age

We are given that John's current age is 28. We can substitute this value into the equation:

28 = 2 * Jim's age

To solve for Jim's age, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Jim's age = 28 / 2
Jim's age = 14

The final answer is 14."
"To determine the total number of slices eaten, we can use a simple arithmetic approach. 

Let's denote the number of slices Doxa ate as x. Since her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, her sister ate x + 1 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate (x + 1) + 1 = x + 2 slices.

The total number of slices eaten is the sum of the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. This can be represented as:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)

Combine like terms:

3x + 3

We know that the total number of slices is 8. So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 3 = 8

Subtract 3 from both sides:

3x = 5

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 5/3

Since x represents the number of slices Doxa ate, we can calculate the number of slices each person ate:

Doxa: x = 5/3
Her sister: x + 1 = 5/3 + 1 = 8/3
Her brother: x + 2 = 5/3 + 2 = 11/3

Now, let's add up the slices eaten by each person:

(5/3) + (8/3) + (11/3) = 24/3 = 8

The total number of slices eaten is 8.

The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. This means they had x - 38 + 50 bandages left.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They still had x - 38 + 50 bandages from the first day, so they had (x - 38 + 50) - 28 bandages left.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they had (x - 38 + 50 - 28) - 25 bandages left.

We know that they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, so we can set up the equation:

(x - 38 + 50 - 28) - 25 = 78

Combine like terms:

x - 38 + 50 - 28 - 25 = 78

Simplify the equation:

x - 43 = 78

Add 43 to both sides:

x = 121

Therefore, the nurses started with 121 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is: 121"
"To calculate the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to consider the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut. The cost of the color is $40, and the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Since her hair length decreased by 2 inches, the cost of the haircut is 2 x $30 = $60.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut: $40 + $60 = $100.

"As a marine biologist specializing in cetacean physiology, I can provide a precise calculation for the total amount of blood in ten sharks.

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons, we can calculate the amount of blood a single shark has by multiplying 40 by 3:

40 × 3 = 120 gallons

To find the total amount of blood that ten sharks have, we multiply the amount of blood a single shark has by 10:

120 × 10 = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have a total of 1200 gallons of blood.

The final answer is: 1200"
"To calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant, we can break down the problem into three distinct time periods.

First, we start with the initial 50 people who entered in the morning. Then, 40 more people entered at 10:00, bringing the total to 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people. Adding these to the previous total, we get 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 40 people came in first, 3 * 40 = 120 people came in by evening. Adding these to the previous total, we get 170 + 120 = 290 people.

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 290.

The final answer is: $\boxed{290}$"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to calculate the number of red pens and black pens separately.

Since each pack has 5 pens, and Alain bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of red pens is 5 packs * 5 pens per pack = 25 pens.

The number of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it is 2 * 25 pens = 50 pens.

The total number of pens Alain has is the sum of red pens and black pens: 25 pens + 50 pens = 75 pens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
"To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first determine the cost of the scotch and cognac.

The cost of the scotch is $600 for 10 bottles. To find the cost per bottle, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 ÷ 10 = $60

Since the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, we can calculate the cost per bottle of cognac by multiplying the cost of the scotch by 1.5:

Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 × 1.5 = $90

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 2 × 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.

The total cost of the cognac is 20 × $90 = $1800.

The total cost of everything is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac:

Total cost = $600 + $1800 = $2400

The final answer is: $2400"
"To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius, we need to break down the information provided.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day is 40 + 10 = 50.

The total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 (White Oak) + 40 (Lodgepole Pine) = 60 trees.

The total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 (White Oak) + 50 (Lodgepole Pine) = 80 trees.

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 (first day) + 80 (second day) = 140 trees.

"To determine the amount of root beer available for the party, we need to calculate the remaining gallons after each incident.

Initially, Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, 4 gallons were consumed, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

On the second day, 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

On the third day, 5 gallons were consumed, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people drank the remaining root beer, so 8 - 3 = 5 gallons remained.

Since there were 3 people at the party, we need to divide the remaining 5 gallons by 3 to find out how much each person got.

5 ÷ 3 = 1.67 gallons per person.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1.67}$"

"To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we find one-third of the total number of fish, which is 66. This represents the number of fish with red stripes.

66 / 3 = 22

Now, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish to find the remaining fish.

66 - 22 = 44

Next, we find 5/11 of the remaining fish, which represents the number of fish with blue stripes.

(5/11) * 44 = 20

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to find the total.

22 + 20 = 42

The final answer is 42."
"To determine the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we need to calculate the colors from the palettes and makeup sets.

Amy had 2 palettes with 4 colors each, so she had 2 * 4 = 8 colors from the palettes.

She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so she had 3 * 6 = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

In total, Amy had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.

Her sister steals one palette, which has 4 colors. So, Amy now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors.

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors.

Now, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

The final answer is 19."
"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to calculate the height of the roof. 

First, we find the height of the first floor: 
The height of the first floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, and Mattison is 60 inches tall. 
So, the height of the first floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches.

Next, we find the height of the second floor: 
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, 
so the height of the second floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

Now, we find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor: 
The height of the roof is the difference between the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor, 
which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{240}$"
"To determine the number of shells team Gogetters found, we need to calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas and team The finders have found their respective shares.

First, we find 40% of 700, which is the number of shells team Alphas found.

40% of 700 = 0.4 * 700 = 280

Now, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total to find the remaining shells.

Remaining shells = 700 - 280 = 420

Next, we calculate 60% of the remaining shells to find the number of shells team The finders found.

60% of 420 = 0.6 * 420 = 252

Finally, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells team Gogetters found.

Shells found by team Gogetters = 420 - 252 = 168

"To determine the walking distance of the last dog, we can start by finding the total walking distance required for all four dogs. Since the average walking distance per dog is 3 miles, we can multiply this by the total number of dogs.

Total walking distance = Average walking distance per dog * Number of dogs
Total walking distance = 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs
Total walking distance = 12 miles

Now, we can subtract the known walking distances of the first three dogs from the total to find the walking distance of the last dog.

Walking distance of the last dog = Total walking distance - (Walking distance of the first dog + Walking distance of the second dog + Walking distance of the third dog)
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - (1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles)
Walking distance of the last dog = 12 miles - 8 miles
Walking distance of the last dog = 4 miles

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To calculate the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we can follow a straightforward approach.

First, we need to determine the loan amount, which is 40% of the house's value. This can be calculated as:

Loan Amount = 0.4 x $250,000
Loan Amount = $100,000

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan is used to pay off debts. Since 60% of the loan is used for debt repayment, we can calculate this as:

Amount Used for Debt Repayment = 0.6 x $100,000
Amount Used for Debt Repayment = $60,000

Finally, to find the amount leftover, we subtract the amount used for debt repayment from the loan amount:

Amount Leftover = Loan Amount - Amount Used for Debt Repayment
Amount Leftover = $100,000 - $60,000
Amount Leftover = $40,000

The final answer is: $40,000"
"To calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas, we need to multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram. 

The total weight of the tunas is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. 

Since a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per kilogram:
128 * 0.50 = $64.

The final answer is: $64."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we need to find the selling price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price. 
Cost price = $72
Selling price = (11/8) * 72
= (11 * 9)
= 99

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= 99 - 72
= 27

The final answer is 27."
"To calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to consider the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.

The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in 1 * 3 = 3 liters. The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which is 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 3 days, resulting in 2 * 3 = 6 liters. The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which is 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day, and Brian ran it for 5 days, resulting in 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Total amount of water removed = 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{29}$"
"To determine the number of balloons thrown, we can use a simple subtraction problem. 

Total number of balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons per pack = 300 balloons
Number of balloons left = 12

Number of balloons thrown = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons left
= 300 - 12
= 288

The final answer is: $\boxed{288}$"
"To determine the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to calculate the amount of each medicine in one dose and then multiply it by 8.

The first medicine requires 14 mL per dose. The second medicine requires 3 times that amount, which is 3 x 14 = 42 mL.

In one dose, the total amount of medicine is 14 + 42 = 56 mL.

To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we multiply the amount in one dose by 8:
56 mL x 8 = 448 mL.

The final answer is: 448"
"As a dean of a private school, I can provide a detailed analysis of the capacity of both schools.

To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each class in John's school has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, we can multiply the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8.

Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * 120 = 15

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is 2 * 15 = 30.

The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of their capacities: 120 (Ali's school) + 30 (John's school) = 150.

The final answer is: $\boxed{150}$"
"To calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to determine the interest on the initial loan amount of $300. The interest rate is 2% per annum, but since the interest is compounded monthly, we'll use the monthly interest rate of 0.5% (2%/12).

Monthly interest rate = 0.5% = 0.005

The total amount owed after 11 months, including the monthly payments, can be calculated as follows:

Total amount owed after 11 months = Initial loan amount + (Monthly payment * 11)
= $300 + ($25 * 11)
= $300 + $275
= $575

Now, we calculate the interest accrued on the total amount owed after 11 months:

Interest = Total amount owed after 11 months * Monthly interest rate
= $575 * 0.005
= $2.875

The amount to be paid in the twelfth month is the total amount owed after 11 months plus the interest:

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount owed after 11 months + Interest
= $575 + $2.875
= $577.875

The final answer is: $577.88"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jordan has 2 children, and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day. To find the total number of diaper changes, we multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes per child:

2 children * 5 diaper changes per child = 10 diaper changes

Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, we need to divide the total number of diaper changes by 2 to find out how many diapers Jordan changes:

10 diaper changes / 2 = 5 diaper changes

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to consider the volume of the jar and the packing efficiency. The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches, so its volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 360 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans have an efficiency of 80%, we need to divide the volume by 0.8 to get the total number of jelly beans: 360 / 0.8 = 450.

However, we know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we need to multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to get the number of red jelly beans: 450 * 0.3 = 135.

But we are given that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find the difference, we subtract the estimated number from the true number: 900 - 135 = 765.

The final answer is: $\boxed{765}$"
"To calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to follow the steps:

The bus initially had 20 people. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This is equivalent to 3/4 * 40 = 30 people. Adding these to the existing passengers, the total becomes 60 + 30 = 90.

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.

Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To calculate the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to consider the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 5 * 3 = $15 per year. For 5 years, she spent 5 * $15 = $75.

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5, and she visited the museum 3 times a year, so she spent 3 * $5 = $15 per year. For 3 years, she spent 3 * $15 = $45.

The total amount Pauline spent on all visits is $75 + $45 = $120.

The final answer is $120."
"To determine the total time required for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of groups that can be formed and the total time required.

There are 10 students in each grade, and 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group:

10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students
30 students / 8 students per group = 3.75 groups

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we can form 3 full groups and 1 group with 2 students.

The time required for each group is 45 minutes. So, the total time required for 3 full groups is:

3 groups * 45 minutes/group = 135 minutes

For the 4th group with 2 students, the time required is 45 minutes.

Total time required = 135 minutes + 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Therefore, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The final answer is: $\boxed{180}$"
"As a carpenter, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved in manufacturing the wooden tables and roof frames for Ali.

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of items by their respective prices. 

The cost of 4 tables at $20 each is 4 x $20 = $80.
The cost of 2 roof frames at $10 each is 2 x $10 = $20.

The total amount Ali has to pay John is $80 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost is $100."
"To determine the length of the longer piece of the board, we can use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x.

We know that the total length of the board is 40 feet, so the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 40. We can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece (x = 8), we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine the amount of steakhouse seasoning Aiden needs, we can use a simple ratio. Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound of ground beef and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can set up a proportion to find the number of pounds of meat needed.

Let x be the number of pounds of meat. We know that 16 meatballs / 1 pound = 80 meatballs / x pounds. We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

16x = 80
x = 80 / 16
x = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can find the total amount of seasoning needed. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat, we can multiply the number of pounds by 2:

5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.

The final answer is: 10"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy, we must calculate the total width of the windows and then multiply it by 2.

Since there are 5 windows, each 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width as follows:

Total width = Number of windows * Width of each window
Total width = 5 * 35
Total width = 175 inches

To find the total amount of fabric needed, we multiply the total width by 2:

Total fabric needed = 2 * Total width
Total fabric needed = 2 * 175
Total fabric needed = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to consider the two pricing tiers: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute, so the total cost is:
16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute, so the total cost is:
20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

The total cost of the 36-minute call is the sum of these two costs:
$4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final answer is: $8.00"
"To determine the total inches of rain on Tuesday, we need to calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 inches. 

Since it's expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total, we add 1 inch to the result, giving us 4 + 1 = 5 inches.

Therefore, the total inches of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebraic equations to represent the relationship between the number of cupcakes and brownies Carly made.

Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies can be represented as 3x - 2.

We know that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. This can be represented as an equation:

x + (3x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the manicure and pedicure with nail art, we need to consider the discounted price of both services and the additional cost of nail art.

The original price of the manicure is $35, and the pedicure is $40. The total cost without the discount is $35 + $40 = $75. The 20% discount is 0.20 * $75 = $15. So, the discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60.

Since Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, she needs 10 nail art sessions (5 for each hand). The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

The total cost for Karen would be the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure plus the cost of nail art: $60 + $30 = $90.

Final answer: $90"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives per year, we need to calculate the number of issues from each magazine and add them together.

The 3 magazines that send 12 issues each will send a total of 3 x 12 = 36 issues per year.

The 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year will send 1 x 6 = 6 issues per year.

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 x 6 = 24 issues per year.

Now, let's add the total number of issues from all the magazines: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66.

Therefore, Susan receives 66 magazines per year.

The final answer is: $\boxed{66}$"
"Let's dive into the world of art and solve this painting puzzle. As an art enthusiast, I'd like to think that my knowledge of color palettes and composition can complement my math skills.

We're given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Let's denote the number of paintings Kim has as 'x'. Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up the equation:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x - 4 = 27

Adding 4 to both sides gives us:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

The final answer is: 31"

"As a tennis pro, I can break down the calculation into two parts: the standard rate lessons and the veteran rate lessons.

For the 4 1-hour lessons at the standard rate, Charlie will earn:
4 * $80 = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, Charlie will earn:
2 * ($80 - 25% of $80)
First, calculate 25% of $80:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20
Then, subtract $20 from the standard rate:
$80 - $20 = $60
Now, multiply by 2:
2 * $60 = $120

Now, add the earnings from both types of lessons:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. This is a basic concept in statistics, and I'm happy to help.

"As a transportation expert, I can analyze Michael's travel scenario to determine the percentage of the distance covered.

To calculate the total distance covered, we need to multiply Michael's average speed by the number of hours he traveled. Assuming a 24-hour day, Michael traveled for 3 days, so the total hours he traveled is 3 * 24 = 72 hours.

Distance covered = Speed * Time
Distance covered = 50 km/hr * 72 hours
Distance covered = 3600 km

To find the percentage of the total distance covered, we need to divide the distance covered by the total distance and multiply by 100.

Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100
Percentage covered = (3600 / 6000) * 100
Percentage covered = 0.6 * 100
Percentage covered = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is: 60"
"To determine the initial number of grapes, we need to consider the sequence of events. 

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother then used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. 

The total grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used by the mother is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Since the total grapes used by the family is 36 (by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

"As a culinary expert, I can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with making homemade macaroni and cheese.

To calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese, we need to consider the cost of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese. The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box, and the cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00 per week. Since Bud spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is $6.00.

The total cost per week is the sum of the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:
$1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost per year is:
$10.00 per week * 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year

"To calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we need to divide the total time spent cleaning (1200 minutes) by the total number of minutes in 40 hours (40 * 60 = 2400 minutes) and then multiply by 100.

Time spent cleaning = (1200 minutes / 2400 minutes) * 100
Time spent cleaning = (1/2) * 100
Time spent cleaning = 50%

The custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms."
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we can calculate the total capacity of the shelves and divide it by the number of books she has.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, and since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the shelves: 
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books
Total capacity: 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 books

Since Elly has 110 books, we need to divide the total number of books by the total capacity of the shelves to find the number of bookcases needed:
110 ÷ 45 = 2.44

Since we can't have a fraction of a bookcase, we round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the books. Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases.

"To determine the number of white hats, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that half of the hats are red. Since Skyler has 100 hats in total, the number of red hats is 100 / 2 = 50.

The remaining hats are 100 - 50 = 50.

Next, we're told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find the number of blue hats, we multiply 3/5 by the remaining hats: 3/5 * 50 = 30.

Now, to find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats: 50 - 30 = 20.

The final answer is 20."
"As a seasoned expert in the field of snack economics, I can confidently analyze the situation and provide the solution.

Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. If Archie buys 1 bag while they're $3.00 off a bag, we need to find the cost of each stick of jerky.

To find the cost per stick, we can divide the discounted price of the bag by the number of sticks. The discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00. 

The cost per stick is $15.00 ÷ 30 = $0.50.

To convert the cost to cents, we multiply by 100: $0.50 × 100 = 50 cents.

The final answer is 50."
"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we can calculate the required percentage of correct answers as follows:

Total questions = 110
Required percentage = 70%

Let's calculate the required number of correct answers:

Required correct answers = Total questions * Required percentage
= 110 * 0.7
= 77

Since Audrey got 60% of the first test correct, which is 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions, we can find the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test by subtracting the number of correct answers from the first test from the total required correct answers:

Questions needed on the second test = Required correct answers - Correct answers on the first test
= 77 - 42
= 35

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is 35."
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as x. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can represent the number of blueberry cubes as 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

Now that we know the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

Number of blueberry cubes = 5x - 4
= 5(20) - 4
= 100 - 4

"Let's break down the events step by step to determine the number of marbles Brendan ended up with.

Brendan initially had 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, which is 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. This means he was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.

However, he then found 3 more marbles, so now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.

Unfortunately, he picked up a bead instead of a marble, so he got rid of 1 marble. Therefore, he is now left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$"
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can use the given conversion rates.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. For every 2 customers, 1 car is sold. To find the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars, we can divide 15 by 1 (since 1 car is sold per 2 customers): 15 ÷ 1 = 15 customers.

2. Since for every 2 customers, 1 potential customer is generated, we need to multiply the number of customers by 2 to get the number of potential customers: 15 customers × 2 = 30 potential customers.

3. For every 25 telephone calls, 1 potential customer is generated. To find the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 potential customers, we can divide 30 by 1 (since 1 potential customer is generated per 25 calls): 30 ÷ 1 = 30 × 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The final answer is: 750"
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights, we need to calculate the number of each type of light source.

There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.

Let's calculate the number of candles in each half of the house:
- Half of the rooms is 8 / 2 = 4 rooms.
- 4 rooms with 4 small candles each will have 4 * 4 = 16 small candles.
- 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each will have 4 * 5 = 20 medium candles.

Total number of candles = 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, the total number of flashlights is 4.

Total number of candles and flashlights = 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40.

The final answer is: 40"
"To determine the number of chips each person gets, we need to divide the total number of chips by the number of family members. Since Mitchell buys two bags of chips with 55 chips each, the total number of chips is 2 * 55 = 110.

Number of family members = 5

Number of chips per person = Total number of chips / Number of family members
= 110 chips / 5
= 22 chips

Therefore, each person gets 22 chips.

The final answer is: $\boxed{22}$"
"The Rubik's cube is a classic puzzle that requires a systematic approach to solve efficiently. To determine the total time it takes to solve the cube, we need to break down the time required for each side.

The first side takes 5 minutes to solve. The second and third sides take twice as long, so each takes 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. The last two sides take half as long as the first, so each takes 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total time by adding up the time for all sides:

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes

Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that there are 20 helmets, and the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. To find the number of footballs, we can set up an equation:

Number of helmets = Number of footballs / 2
20 = Number of footballs / 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can set up another equation:

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

The final answer is: $\boxed{70}$"
"To calculate the total number of calls Tim deals with in a week, we need to first determine the total minutes he spends on calls in a week. Since Tim spends 6 hours a day on calls, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

6 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Since there are 5 days in a work week, the total number of minutes he spends on calls in a week is:

360 minutes/day × 5 days = 1800 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to deal with a call (15 minutes):

1800 minutes ÷ 15 minutes/call = 120 calls

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

The final answer is: 120"
"As an artist and varnish expert, I can analyze the situation based on my knowledge of varnish drying times.

When applying a coat of varnish to paintings, the drying time is a crucial factor to consider. The standard drying time for the old varnish is 7 minutes per painting, while the new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry per painting.

To determine the difference in drying time for 6 paintings, we can calculate the total drying time for each varnish type:

Old varnish: 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes
New varnish: 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

The difference in drying time is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry than it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is: $\boxed{30}$"
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants, we can break down the problem into three categories based on the number of plants and the amount of water each group requires.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that require half a cup of water. This can be calculated as 4 x 0.5 = 2 cups.

Next, we have the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each, which can be calculated as 8 x 1 = 8 cups.

Lastly, we have the remaining 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each. This can be calculated as 8 x 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, let's add the water needed for each group: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The final answer is: $\boxed{12}$"
"To calculate the total time it will take Phineas to return home, we need to consider the time spent on land and in water separately. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the total distance is 200 yards.

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
Time on land = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute
Time on land = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
Time in water = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute
Time in water = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
Total time = 15 minutes

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$"
"To calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks needed for the Washington Monument project, we can use the following formula:

Total Cost = Number of Popsicle Sticks / Number of Sticks per Box * Cost per Box

Given that Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box contains 8 sticks, we can plug in the values as follows:

Total Cost = 56 / 8 * $2.00

First, divide 56 by 8:
56 ÷ 8 = 7

Then, multiply the result by $2.00:
7 * $2.00 = $14.00

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00."
"To calculate the total cost of the phone plan, we need to consider the cost of the main phone and the additional phones. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can express this relationship as:

Main phone cost = 2 × Additional phone cost

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up an equation to find the cost of each additional phone:

20 = 2 × Additional phone cost

To solve for the additional phone cost, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

Additional phone cost = 20 ÷ 2
Additional phone cost = 10

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost of the additional phones is:

Total cost of additional phones = 4 × Additional phone cost
Total cost of additional phones = 4 × 10
Total cost of additional phones = 40

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the main phone cost and the total cost of the additional phones:

Total cost = Main phone cost + Total cost of additional phones
Total cost = 20 + 40
Total cost = 60

The final answer is: $60"
"As a pastry expert, I can help you calculate Derrick's total earnings for June.

To determine Derrick's daily doughnut production, we need to convert the dozen to individual doughnuts. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, Derrick produces 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

Now, let's calculate Derrick's total doughnut production in June. With 30 days in June, Derrick produces 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

Since each doughnut is sold at $2, Derrick's total earnings for June can be calculated as 3600 * 2 = $7200.

- 2 pairs of pants at $8.00 each: 2 * $8.00 = $16.00
- 1 skirt at $6.00: $6.00

Total weekly expenses: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

To find the total expenses for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly expenses by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"To calculate the time it would take John to speak 10 pages, we need to first find his new speed in words per minute. 

John's original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.

Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find the time it would take to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total number of words by the speed: 
4500 / 375 = 12 minutes.

The final answer is: 12"
"To calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we can break down the information as follows:

On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach. The next day, 20 more people were present, resulting in 70 people. On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which is 2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the remaining 4 days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. To find the total number of people for these days, we can multiply the average by the number of days: 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, let's add up the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 400 people

"The art of popcorn popping dynamics! As a popcorn connoisseur, I can assure you that the key to understanding this problem lies in the realm of exponential growth and decay. Let's dive into the world of popcorn kinetics.

To calculate the total number of kernels that popped, we can break down the problem into four distinct intervals:

1. The initial 30 seconds: 20 kernels pop.
2. The next 30 seconds: 3 times the initial rate, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. The subsequent 30 seconds: 4 times the initial rate, resulting in 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. The final 30 seconds: Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, yielding 40 kernels.

Now, let's add up the total number of kernels that popped:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels

However, we must also account for the additional 10 kernels that popped from the residual heat. This is a classic example of exponential decay, where a quarter of the final 30 seconds' kernels pop.

The total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

The final answer is: $\boxed{210}$"
"To determine the total number of lemons required, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons of lemonade. Since 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of lemon juice, and 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of cups of lemon juice needed:

5 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 5 cups

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, we can calculate the total number of lemons needed:

5 cups / 1 cup/6 lemons = 5 * 6 = 30 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons to make 5 gallons of lemonade, including the extra gallon that is twice as tart."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the Kennel house, we need to calculate the daily consumption of both breeds and then multiply it by 7.

The daily consumption of dog food can be calculated as follows:

German Shepherds: 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
Bulldogs: 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day
Total daily consumption: 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg/day

To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:

Total weekly consumption = 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To calculate the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can use the formula:

Total pairs of legs = (2-legged animals * 2) + (4-legged animals * 2)

This is because each 2-legged animal contributes 2 legs and each 4-legged animal contributes 4 legs.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total pairs of legs = (10 * 2) + (15 * 2)
= 20 + 30
= 50

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 50.

The final answer is 50."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that the tower consists of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. This means the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8.

To find the total number of blue and yellow blocks, we add 4 (blue blocks) and 8 (yellow blocks), which equals 12.

Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, we can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from 32. This gives us 32 - 12 = 20.

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{20}$"
"To determine the distance Elvis is from his house, we can use the concept of net displacement. Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we can find the net displacement by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.

Net displacement = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west
Net displacement = 144 miles - 90 miles
Net displacement = 54 miles

Since Elvis is 54 miles away from his house, we can conclude that he is 54 miles east of his starting point.

Final answer: 54"
"To calculate the value of the boat after three years, we need to apply the depreciation rates for each year.

The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year, which can be expressed as 0.3 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the initial value of the boat.

Year 1:
Value after 1 year = Initial value - (Depreciation rate * Initial value)
= $9000 - (0.3 * $9000)
= $9000 - $2700
= $6300

In the second year, the boat depreciates by another 30%, which is also 0.3 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the value after the first year.

Year 2:
Value after 2 years = Value after 1 year - (Depreciation rate * Value after 1 year)
= $6300 - (0.3 * $6300)
= $6300 - $1890
= $4410

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, which is 0.2 in decimal form. The depreciation amount is then multiplied by the value after the second year.

Year 3:
Value after 3 years = Value after 2 years - (Depreciation rate * Value after 2 years)
= $4410 - (0.2 * $4410)
= $4410 - $882
= $3528

The boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we need to analyze the given information. We know that the bag contains 232 pieces of individually wrapped candies, with 54 red candies, twice as many orange candies as red candies, and half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Let's calculate the number of orange and yellow candies:
Orange candies = 2 * 54 = 108
Yellow candies = 54 / 2 = 27

Now, let's find the total number of non-pink candies:
Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of non-pink candies from the total number of candies in the bag:
232 - 189 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 pink candies in the bag."

"To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to consider the initial amount of marbles Mazie had and the number of marbles Dallas had after dropping some.

Mazie initially had 52 marbles. Since Dallas ended up with 21 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas had from the initial amount.

Let's denote the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla as x. We can set up the equation:

52 - x = 21

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

52 = 21 + x

Subtracting 21 from both sides gives us:

31 = x

So, Mazie gave 31 marbles to Darla.

The final answer is: 31"
"To calculate the total cost of the family's outing to the cinema, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the popcorns.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there are 3 family members (2 adults and 1 child), the total cost of the tickets is:

2 adult tickets = 2 x $12 = $24
1 child ticket = $8
Total cost of tickets = $24 + $8 = $32

The cost of 2 popcorns is $3 each, so the total cost of the popcorns is:

2 popcorns = 2 x $3 = $6

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tickets and the popcorns:

Total cost = $32 + $6 = $38

Therefore, the family pays a total of $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To calculate the force required to move the car, we need to consider the total weight of the car and its contents. The weight of the car itself is 1200 pounds, and the weight of the luggage is 250 pounds. Additionally, there are two children weighing 75 pounds each, so their combined weight is 150 pounds.

Total weight = weight of the car + weight of luggage + weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 + 250 + 150
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Since the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight, we can calculate it as follows:

Force = 1% of 1600 pounds
Force = 0.01 * 1600
Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds."

Therefore, James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers around his backyard fence."
"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we can use the formula for calculating the average of two numbers: (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2.

Given that Mia is 40 years old and is 16 years younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, we can find the average of their ages by adding their ages and dividing by 2.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The average of their ages is 48."

"To determine the amount of feed left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a week. Since each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, we can calculate the daily feed consumption as follows:

Daily feed consumption = 5 pigs * 4 pounds/pig * 2 meals/day = 40 pounds/day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily feed consumption by 7:

Total feed consumption = 40 pounds/day * 7 days = 280 pounds

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. To find out how much is left, we subtract the total feed consumed from the total ordered:

Feed left = 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds

The total area of the quilt can be calculated as follows:
(11 small shirts * 3 square feet/shirt) + (8 medium shirts * 4 square feet/shirt) + (6 large shirts * 6 square feet/shirt)
= 33 + 32 + 36
= 101 square feet

The quilt will require 101 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds

Now, we need to find 50% of 36. To do this, we multiply 36 by 0.5:

36 × 0.5 = 18

Since the large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower, we add 18 to 36:

36 + 18 = 54

Therefore, a large sunflower has 54 seeds.

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from the small sunflower (36) and the large sunflower (54):

36 + 54 = 90

The total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"To determine the number of pens Sarah has, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of pens George has as G. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can express Timothy's pens as 3G. 

We are given that George has 18 pens, so G = 18. Now, we can find Timothy's pens by multiplying 18 by 3.

3G = 3(18) = 54

Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can express Sarah's pens as (1/2) * 54.

(1/2) * 54 = 27

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is 27."
"To determine Jackie's height before the summer, we need to consider the given information. We know Albert is 36"" tall, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, making her 72"". Since Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, her height is 72"" - 2"" = 70"".

To find Jackie's height before the summer, we subtract the growth of 3"" from her current height. 

70"" - 3"" = 67""

The final answer is: $\boxed{67}$"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company will receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to multiply the number of bars produced in two weeks by the price per bar.

The company produces 5000 bars in one day. In two weeks (14 days), it will produce:
5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars

The price per bar is $2, so the total amount of money the company will receive is:
70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000

The final answer is: $140,000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Jake is shopping at a clothing store with a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, we need to calculate the total cost of the T-shirts.

The first T-shirt is full price, so its cost is $8. The second T-shirt has a 50% discount, which means Jake pays 50% of the original price. To find 50% of $8, we multiply $8 by 0.5.

Cost of the second T-shirt = $8 x 0.5 = $4

Total cost of T-shirts = Cost of the first T-shirt + Cost of the second T-shirt
= $8 + $4
= $12

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. To find the discount, we multiply the original price by 0.4.

Discount on the shoes = $40 x 0.4
= $16

Cost of the shoes = Original price - Discount
= $40 - $16
= $24

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends at the store.

Total amount spent = Total cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes
= $12 + $24
= $36

The final answer is: $36"
"Let's break down Ryan's situation step by step.

Ryan earns $6 per week for completing his chores. Since he completed his chores for 3 weeks, his total earnings are:

6 * 3 = $18

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. The total cost of the ice cream cones is:

1.25 * 4 = $5

Now, let's subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings:

$18 - $5 = $13

Ryan has $13 left. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we'll divide $13 by the cost of each ticket ($6.50):

$13 ÷ $6.50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets."

"To calculate the profit from selling 10 jars of Tim's special honey and jam mix, we need to consider the cost of the ingredients and the selling price.

The cost of making one jar is calculated as follows:

Cost of passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey: 2 pounds * $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of one jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

The selling price of one jar is $50. To find the profit per jar, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

Now, to find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
Total profit = $6 * 10 = $60

The final answer is: $60"
"As a finance expert, I can help you calculate the total dollar amount in the jar.

To find the total value, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and add them together.

- 32 quarters = 32 x $0.25 = $8
- 95 dimes = 95 x $0.10 = $9.50
- 120 nickels = 120 x $0.05 = $6
- 750 pennies = 750 x $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add the values together:
$8 + $9.50 = $17.50
$17.50 + $6 = $23.50
$23.50 + $7.50 = $31

Amount left = $12

Janet has $12 left."
"As a car shop owner, I can provide a detailed calculation to determine Josh's earnings over a 2-week period.

Josh's shop is open 6 days a week, excluding Sundays and Wednesdays. This means he operates 6 days a week, resulting in a total of 6 * 2 = 12 operating days in 2 weeks.

Since Josh services 3 cars per day, the total number of cars serviced in 2 weeks is 3 * 12 = 36 cars.

Given that Josh earns $4 per car, his total earnings over 2 weeks can be calculated as 36 * $4 = $144.

The final answer is: $144"
"Let's break down the events step by step to determine the number of cookies Randy has now.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he consumes 3 cookies in total. To find the remaining cookies, we subtract 3 from the initial total:

9 (oatmeal) + 4 (chocolate) + 5 (sugar) = 18 cookies
18 - 3 = 15 cookies

He then eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with:

15 - 2 = 13 cookies

Next, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, reducing the total to:

13 - 2 = 11 cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner, adding 8 new cookies to his collection:

11 + 8 = 19 cookies

Randy now has 19 cookies in total.

Let's break it down:

- The first half of the collection consists of 6 unique toy soldiers. If sold at $5 per toy, the total earnings would be: 6 * 5 = $30.
- The second half of the collection also consists of 6 unique toy soldiers. If sold at $7 per toy, the total earnings would be: 6 * 7 = $42.

To find the total amount Matthew would earn, we add the earnings from both scenarios: $30 + $42 = $72.

The final answer is: $72"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog and then find out how many days it takes to fill them.

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes

Since Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
9 holes/day (filled) - 6 holes/day (dug) = 3 holes/day

To fill 84 holes, it will take:
84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert 28 days to weeks:
28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks

Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Final answer: 4"
"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we can use a simple subtraction method.

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

Average enrollment at Butler High School = (3/4) * 4000
= 3000

Now, we can find the difference in average enrollment between the two schools by subtracting the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

Difference in average enrollment = 4000 - 3000
= 1000

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1000}$"
"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we can use the principle of subtraction. 

Let's calculate the total number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies: 
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

Now, subtract this total from the overall number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Total of rainbow and oatmeal cookies
= 7995 - 5670
= 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of test tubes as T, the number of beakers as B, and the number of Petri dishes as P.

We know that Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so T = 16 / 2 = 8.
We also know that Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so P = 14 + 2 = 16.
The total number of items Igor had is T + B + P, and we know this equals 29. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

To solve for B, we can subtract 8 and 16 from both sides of the equation:

B = 29 - 8 - 16
B = 5

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to consider the fact that Igor lost some beakers. Let's re-examine the equation:

8 + B + 16 = 29

We can rewrite the equation as:

B + 24 = 29

Subtracting 24 from both sides gives us:

B = 5

This means that Igor had 5 beakers initially. Since the correct number of beakers requested was 7, Igor must have lost:

7 - 5 = 2

beakers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$"
"To determine the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed can be calculated as follows:

Total screws needed = Number of tables x Number of legs per table x Number of screws per leg
Total screws needed = 4 x 4 x 2
Total screws needed = 32

Since James has 40 screws, we can find the number of screws left over by subtracting the total screws needed from the total screws he has:

Screws left over = Total screws - Total screws needed
Screws left over = 40 - 32
Screws left over = 8

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can simply add the number of eggs in the first basket (10) to the number of eggs in the second basket (which is twice as many as the first basket, so 10 x 2 = 20).

10 + 20 = 30

The total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To calculate the total amount of money raised, we need to find the individual amounts raised by each person and add them together.

Let's start by finding the amount raised by Kim. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, and Alexandra raises $430, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:

Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
Kim's amount = $430 + $320
Kim's amount = $750

Next, we find Maryam's amount. Since Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raises $300, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:

Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
Maryam's amount = $300 + $400
Maryam's amount = $700

Now, we have the amounts raised by each person: Alexandra ($430), Kim ($750), Maryam ($700), and Sarah ($300). To find the total amount, we add these amounts together:

Total amount = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Maryam's amount + Sarah's amount
Total amount = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300
Total amount = $2080

The total amount of money they all raised is $2080."
"Let's break down the problem step by step. We know that Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, and we're given the following information:

- Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, we can represent Vanessa's speed as x miles per minute. Then, Aaron's speed would be 2x miles per minute.

We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran 2 miles, we can set up the equation:

2x * 16 = 2 miles

To find Vanessa's speed, we can first solve for x:

2x * 16 = 2
32x = 2
x = 2/32
x = 1/16 miles per minute

Now that we know Vanessa's speed, we can find the time it took her to run 4 miles:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (1/16 miles per minute)
Time = 4 * 16
Time = 64 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64}$"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs, we can calculate the difference between the length of the dock and the length of line already available. 

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. So, the total length of line required is 3 x 200 = 600 feet.

However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of line. To find the total amount of line needed, we subtract the available line from the required line: 600 - 6 = 594 feet.

Therefore, the caretaker needs 594 feet of line in total.

The final answer is: $\boxed{594}$"
"As a financial analyst specializing in restaurant operations, I can provide a detailed breakdown of Tom's restaurant revenue.

To calculate the weekly revenue, we need to consider the number of reservations, meal prices, and the cost of wine. Assuming the restaurant operates 2 days a week, we can calculate the daily revenue as follows:

Daily revenue = (Number of reservations * Number of meals per reservation * Meal price) + (Number of reservations * Wine price)
= (6 * 2 * $5) + (6 * $5)
= $60 + $30
= $90 per day

Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the weekly revenue is:

Weekly revenue = Daily revenue * 2
= $90 * 2
= $180

The final answer is: $180"
"To calculate the selling price of each watermelon, we can use the following formula:

Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage * Cost Price)

Given:
Cost Price = $80
Profit Percentage = 25% = 0.25

Selling Price = $80 + (0.25 * $80)
= $80 + $20
= $100

Since the vendor sold all 50 watermelons, we can find the selling price per watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

Selling Price per Watermelon = Total Selling Price / Number of Watermelons
= $100 / 50
= $2

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is: $2"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, James' current age is 2 * 9 = 18 years.

John had a son James when he was 19, and James is now 18 years old. So, John's current age is 19 + 18 = 37 years.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person spends peeling oranges and then find the difference.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. 

In 1 hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.
Jane will peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.

The difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.

The final answer is 5."
"To calculate the total cost of the new radiator, we need to consider the discounted price and the labor cost.

The original price of the radiator is $400. Since Mark gets an 80% discount, the discounted price is 20% of the original price. 

20% of $400 is calculated as 0.20 * $400 = $80.

The labor cost for the mechanic is 3 hours * $50 per hour = $150.

The total cost Mark paid is $80 (discounted radiator) + $150 (labor) = $230.

The final answer is: $230"
"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of chickens as x and the number of cows as y. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 20

We also know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. This gives us another equation:

2x + 4y = 70

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting it from the second equation:

2x + 4y = 70
2(x + y) = 40
2x + 2y = 40

Subtracting this equation from the second equation:

(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
2y = 30

Dividing both sides by 2:

y = 15

Now that we know y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find x:

x + 15 = 20
x = 5

So, there are 5 chickens.

The final answer is 5."
"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

There are 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56.

There are 4 people who want to share the pizzas equally. 

Now, divide the total number of slices (56) by the number of people (4):

56 ÷ 4 = 14

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.

The final answer is: $\boxed{14}$"
